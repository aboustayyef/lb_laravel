<p>The DevAppLB 12­Hour Ultralight Hackathon, organized by AltCity with strategic partners Al Mawarid Bank, Beirut Digital DIstrict, and Middle East Venture Partners, aims at kickstarting the mobile app production economy in Lebanon. “Instead of having startups work on complex solutions that take months or years to develop, we want developers and entrepreneurs to focus on startups that can launch in beta version within days or weeks,” says Munir Nabti, CEO of AltCity. “Speed is a critical component of web/mobile and tech entrepreneurship these days.”</p>
<p><a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/~i0.wp.com/tech-ticker.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/DevAppLB-Hackathon-2.jpg" rel="gallery-23475"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/tech-ticker.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/DevAppLB-Hackathon-2.jpg?resize=960%2C720" alt="DevAppLB Hackathon" data-recalc-dims="1"></a></p>
<p>Another unique feature to this Ultralight Hackathon was that the participants had to build apps or games that were assigned to them, rather than ideas of their own. The ideas were generated through four ideation sessions held last April at university campuses (AUB, LAU, and USJ) and at AltCity. At 9am sharp on May 3, each team picked a balloon that was labeled with nothing but app or game. The teams then simultaneously popped the balloons to find the brief of the app or game they will be developing over the 12 hours that followed.</p>
<p>“We think this kind of dynamic energy and enthusiasm is critical to drive the startup ecosystem forward in Lebanon,” said Mouhamad Rabah of Beirut Digital District, a partner in the hackathon and host of the event.</p>
<p>The Hackathon started with 10 teams working on 8 apps and two games. The teams worked continuously till 9pm sharp, when the final pitches and judging started. Each team had three minutes to pitch their progress to the jury included Elie Nasr, from FOO, Joe Hannouch, from Game Cooks, Ayman Chalhoub from NYMGO representing BDD, and Munir Nabti from AltCity.</p>
<p>The Hackathon was tough, two teams dropped out a couple of hours before the end time. One of those teams that quit later decided to join back and pitch whatever they developed of their app, a map based app that helps people in Lebanon navigate Beirut’s chaotic public bus system. Hassan Kanj, the developer of the app, said that it was his first time ever working with the maps API; “It is a great opportunity to learn something new, winning is great, but the ultimate goal is bigger. I love the idea of the app, and I will definitely keep working on it after the Hackathon,” Kanj added.</p>
<p>“We are very excited to have sponsored this event since we are avid believers in the empowerment of the young and future entrepreneurs,” said Diala Kassem CRO of Al Mawarid Bank, another partner in the program. “They are the engine of innovation and economic growth in our country. Supporting future entrepreneurs and developing their skill is embodied in Al Mawarid Bank’s main strategy.”</p>
<p>After an hour of pitches, the jury announced the top three winners. The first place went to team CtrlCity (Karim Frenn, Guy Daher, Sami Ramly) that worked on a weather app that suggests what clothing to wear, either at home or while traveling. The second place went to team Green Apple (Georges Kanaan and Yara Kanaan), 15 and 11 years old respectively. They worked on a fitness counter that counts repetitive body movements. The third place went to team Dusty Cartridge (Fouad Tabsh, George Habr, Carl Farra) that built a song trivia game.</p>
<p>Notable mentions include Team Urth ( Samir Kazah, Hussam Kazah, Anass Kazah) that built an original Pacman game with a twist, Team V8 (Suhail Yazji, AbdulRahman El Hamali) that build an NFC based contact info sharing app, and Team Blue Dot (Mohammad Al Amin, Firas Wazneh) that built a Tinder­like application for pets.</p>
<p>This Hackathon wouldn’t have been possible without the support of our strategic partners, Beirut Digital District, Al Mawarid Bank, and Middle East Venture Partners. Other partners were also critical to the success of the event, including our training partners (Perform, Game Cooks, Rawad Hajj, and Dani Arnaout), our innovation partners (Apstrata, Agence Universitaire de la Francophonie, Amideast, WSI Lebanon), and our media and community partners (Wamda, Cloud961, Alliance for Social Entrepreneurship, Netherlands Game Award, The Tech­Ticker, Berytech).</p>
<p>The DevAppLB activities will continue throughout the year. To stay updated about all app or game related workshops, competitions, or events, like AltCity’s Facebook page, or join our mailing list (from the Facebook page or <span>www.altcity.me</span>).</p>

<p>2 days ago, a conference was held at Phoenicia hotel in Beirut where the attendants got acquainted about this new “brought to Lebanon” technology by Credit Bank and MasterCard.</p>
<p>A smart and secure sticker will transform any personal item (smartphone, passport, etc.) into a payment tool just by being attached to it, allowing fast payment at any store having MasterCard contactless payment terminal.</p>
<p>This new approach of e-payment, almost considered as mobile payment since most of people will attach the sticker to their smartphones, is surely easy, handy and faster than using cash or debit/credit card. Few years passed since this sticker is being used in Europe.</p>
<p><a href="http://lfadi.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/12.jpg"><img src="http://lfadi.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/12.jpg?w=243&h=300" alt="1"></a></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Below the comments of Mr. Tarek Khalife, the Chairman of the Board at Credit Bank:</p>
<blockquote><p>Innovation has always been regarded a core value at Creditbank. It is intrinsic part of the bank’s new corporate identity and logo, which were launched in early 2014. Two pillars make up the bank’s corporate essence. First of all, the ability to listen and understand the customer’s every need and, secondly, to act upon his or her wishes with enthusiasm and professionalism. Creditbank therefore is continuously on the lookout to make the banking experience a more personalized and comfortable experience.”</p>
<p>The bank’s slogan “People you can bank on” is more than a brand promise: it is the promise on which all business is conducted and concluded.</p></blockquote>

<p><span>Samsung and Swarovski have teamed up and launched an exclusive line of accessories for your S5 and Gear Fit. You can now swap your S5 cover with a crystal-encrusted one, and add a few other shiny accessories with various options for you to mix and match to your style. </span></p>

<p>The collection will be available in the <a title="Samsung Store" href="http://store.samsung.com/" target="_blank">Samsung online store</a> and will roll into the brick-and-mortar stores after May 22. We don’t know when this will be available in the UAE, but we suspect it will be a big hit here.</p>

The announcement was made today at an event that was attended by representatives of Creditbank, MasterCard, CSC Bank, Unilux and Gemalto.</p>
<p>The Creditbank MasterCard Contactless Sticker is a smart, mobile and secure way to pay and is faster than using cash or waiting for change. The MasterCard Contactless Sticker uses MasterCard contactless technology and it allows any personal item to be converted into a payment tool. Creditbank customers just need to attach the innovative tag on their mobile phones or even an identity card or driver’s license and start using it to shop at all merchant locations with MasterCard contactless payment terminals.</p>
<p>“The Creditbank MasterCard Contactless Sticker payment solution that we launch today is an innovation that will transform and redefine the world of mobile payments. This solution will make low-value purchases exceedingly simple by converting any mobile phone of any generation into a credit card which can then be used to make easy and fast contactless payments<strong>. </strong>  We are delighted to collaborate with Creditbank, Gemalto and Unilux to launch this first of its kind payment solution in Lebanon. These are exciting times for the people of Lebanon and we are honored to be part of this positive change that will help drive the future growth of Lebanon’s payment landscape,” said Basel El tell, Market Manager for Levant, MasterCard.</p>
<p>The Creditbank’s retail division first spotted the contactless sticker a few years back in Europe and saw its huge potential in terms of technological advancement and customer comfort. As a result, the Bank decided to bring the solution to the Lebanese market , which is known for its high adoption rates of new technology .</p>
<p>Mr. Tarek Khalifé, Chairman of the Board, Creditbank, commented: “Innovation has always been regarded a core value at Creditbank. It is intrinsic part of the bank’s new corporate identity and logo, which were launched in early 2014. Two pillars make up the bank’s corporate essence. First of all, the ability to listen and understand the customer’s every need and, secondly, to act upon his or her wishes with enthusiasm and professionalism. Creditbank therefore is continuously on the lookout to make the banking experience a more personalized and comfortable experience.”</p>
<p>The bank’s slogan “People you can bank on” is more than a brand promise: it is the promise on which all business is conducted and concluded.</p>

As far-fetched as it initially was perceived, the Freemium model has become over the past decade the dominant business model among Internet startups and mobile app developers.</p>
<p>A quick reminder on how the model works: users get basic features at no cost and can access additional functionality for a (mostly recurrent) subscription fee. A few examples of this would be services like LinkedIn, Dropbox and Hulu.</p>
<p>What lies beneath the success of this particular model? The appeal of a Freemium strategy comes from multiple factors: Since free features offered to users are a potent marketing tool, the model allows any new venture to scale up and attract a user base without the extra cost of ad campaigns or any other sales effort. Besides this, the potential subscription fee has proven to be a more sustainable than traditional advertising revenues that was prevailing in the app world up to not so very long ago.</p>
<p>Freemium is definitely a more attractive alternative to the 30-day free trial model, since the latter comprises inherent cancellation procedures that most users loathe.</p>
<p>However, the Freemium model is still perceived as a bit… off. Let us get deeper into the model to try and see how it functions, and how can it succeed.</p>
<h2>What Should Be Free?</h2>
<p>Basically, a Freemium model works that way: a company that has a portfolio of 10 digital products will offer 3 of them to all users that will register, while offering the remaining 7 to premium subscribers. But how should the company choose what is to be offered for free and what is not?</p>
<p>Companies should never forget that the very primary purpose of the Freemium model is to attract customers. If the model is heavy to pickup, then you might want to review the free services offered, as they might not be truly attractive. On the opposite, if you are witnessing a lot of traffic and product adoption but very few people are upgrading to a full-subscribed model, then you might be offering a too rich product bundle for free. It is never bad to review these tactics with time, tweaking the offering a bit more or a bit less depending on the analytics on-hand.</p>
<h2>Is The Freemium Model Misunderstood?</h2>
<p>The difficulty lies in the differentiation between what is offered for free and what is offered with the upgrade. If the users do not fully understand why they should upgrade, then the outcome will definitely prove to be rather sour.</p>
<h2>How to Measure a Successful Freemium Model?</h2>
<p>Of course, the key figure here would be the conversion rate, meaning how many “free” users are converting to “premium”. Logical thinking would lead us to think that higher conversion rates mean a more successful model. However, things cannot be that plain; It would be far better to convert 5% of 2 million monthly visitors than to convert 50% of 100.000 visitors. In fact, it all depends on the size of targeted market or userbase. If the target is small, then a higher conversion rate would be a more adequate measure of success.</p>
<p>We should also note that it is fairly correct to assume that the conversion cycle is rather negatively correlated with time. Early adopters are less price-sensitive and are hence more willing to upgrade, while follower crowd will be more resistant. This is why Freemium companies should be prepared for a most certain cash strain in the future.</p>
<p>The key ingredient for the durable success of a Freemium model would be innovation. Companies should never forget to innovate every now and then, with new offerings, new products, new features. This is what will fuel the rollover of the current userbase and potentially attract new adopters.</p>

<p>You remember how in a <a href="http://mustapha.me/2014/04/microsoft-just-wont-take-my-money/">previous post</a> I wrote that I’m moving all my work files to Microsoft’s <em>OneDrive</em> instead of <em>Dropbox?</em> Boy that turned out to be a big mistake… I spent the last two hours undoing that whole thing and moving everything back to <em>DropBox</em>. I’m even thinking now of paying <em>DropBox</em> for a larger account.</p>
<p>Many online reviewers claim that <em>DropBox</em> and <em>OneDrive</em> offer the same service, which is cloud storage that syncs with a local folder. This is largely true, but there is one crucial detail that is different and that has become a deal breaker for me.</p>
<p>With <em>Dropbox</em>, when you work on a file, change it and save it, it will save the file on your desktop first, then the <em>DropBox</em> daemon will sync it in the background with the server, leaving your workflow uninterrupted.</p>
<p><em>OneDrive</em> is similar, except when it comes to Microsoft Office files like Word and Excel (which is what I wanted to use it for in the first place). With Office files, <em>OneDrive</em> behaves as if you’re editing the files directly in the server, with all the freezes, the waits and the lack of responsiveness you can expect of that. I created a new word document and I saved it to my OneDrive Folder. This should have been a very routine and quick thing to do: You are saving to your hard disk, and <em>DropBox</em> would have immediately saved it. But <em>OneDrive</em> has to first “connect to the server” to make sure that there is no file with such a name, it took forever until I could finally get out of the “save” modal window.</p>
<p>Anyway, I think I’ll still use <em>OneDrive</em> for other files that are unrelated to Microsoft. But for the serious stuff, it’s back to <em>DropBox</em>.</p>

Nowadays, the whole economy revolves around the digital sphere: be it in the digitalization of monetary fluxes or in the globalization of all trade and monetary exchanges.</p>
<p>So what does this program offer? from fundamentals of Economics to specific related IT tools mastering, digital law and others, the curriculum encompasses multiple skills in order to tackle today’s intertwining business needs of Economics and the Web.</p>
<p>This program is part of the Web Science Community, which regroups eighteen universities and faculties across the globe (Southampton University, The Internet Institute of Oxford, University of San Fransisco…), thus benefiting from common courses, researches and ideas across the network.</p>
<p>What would be the probable outcome? This program basically aims at serve, educate and train people wanting to become Strategists and Consultants in IT Economics, Web entrepreneurs and Web Science specialists. Are there any real need in the market for such graduates? Most definitely, mainly in the financial services sector, in the Tech Startups niche, but also in any company that is willing to implement a serious Web and digital strategy.</p>

Where legal, the sector is generally tightly regulated – but, even so, it is widely perceived to be a target for money launderers. Some analysts, as we will see below, suggest, however, that the risks are over-hyped, with too little data to evidence the threat.</span></span></div><span><span></span></span><br><div lang="en-GB"><span><span>Law around e-commerce and the internet is, in general, still in its infancy and weak in most jurisdictions, struggling to keep up with technological change. Similarly, anti-money laundering (AML)  authorities are only now beginning to seriously address the nefarious potential of online gambling, e-gaming and related alternative e-currencies. </span></span></div><span><span></span></span><span><span><span lang="en-GB">The </span></span><span>Financial Action Task Force (FATF)</span><span><span lang="en-GB">, for instance, only issued specific guidance on application of a risk based approach for casinos in 2008, warning then that illicit funds could be channelled through remotely-accessed (online) games and accounts. The Council of Europe's Moneyval committee issued its first report on e-gambling in 2013, but its risk assessment was qualified due to lack of data; and there has been scant progress since.</span></span></span><br><span><span></span></span><span><span>“<span lang="en-GB">When we did the report, very few financial intelligence units (FIUs) had received suspicious transaction reports (STRs) [relating to e-gambling], and as typologies are generally based on STRs, when it came to analysis already done by the FIUs, we found very little information, so it was hard to understand the extent of the problem,” said a member of Moneyval’s secretariat who requested anonymity. “We thought the problem was maybe due to us looking at a specific geographic region, but the EU [European Union] in its 2012 report faced the same problems,” he said, referring to the September 2012 European Commission Communication (policy paper) “Towards a comprehensive European framework for online gambling.”</span></span></span><br><span><span></span></span><br><div lang="en-GB"><span><span>When Moneyval conducted its study, said the official, “we thought it was early days, but some time has passed and there is still limited information on the phenomenon of online gambling.” He is uneasy about this, noting: “You could argue that this is a vulnerability in itself, as very few FIUs and enforcement authorities have any information to base analysis on and conduct risk assessments…” Meanwhile, the debate continues, with some experts concluding “that this sector doesn't pose significant or specific risks.”</span></span></div><span><span></span></span><span><span><span lang="en-GB">In the EU, the proposed Fourth Money Laundering Directive(4MLD) recommends extension of AML/CTF controls to e-gambling activities. Even assuming the proposal becomes law, significant political hurdles would remain to be overcome not least as, to date, any common approach to regulation in the area by member states has been notable only for its absence: </span></span><span>“<span lang="en-GB">There has been no move towards harmonisation at the EU level as many states are very protective with regard to gambling, and why it is outside EU regulations, even not in online regulations, as members states don't want it to be. So it looks like it will be left to domestic regulators,” said Clive Hawkswood, chief executive of the UK-based Remote Gambling Association (RGA). </span></span></span><br><span><span></span></span><span><span>“<span lang="en-GB">Who knows what happens in unregulated markets,” added Hawkswood. “Apparently, there are huge sums going through un-licensed sports bookies in India and elsewhere. But in regulated and licensed markets [in the EU], we have a good record so far.”</span></span></span><br><div lang="en-GB"><span><span><br></span></span></div><span><span></span></span><br><div lang="en-GB"><b><span><span>Non-EU</span></span></b></div><div lang="en-GB"><span><span><br></span></span></div><span><span></span></span><br><div lang="en-GB"><span><span>Complicating matters outside of Europe are the highly diverse approaches to gambling, with, for example all forms banned in mainland China and much of the Middle East. “Given the extent that gambling and e-gambling is illegal in many places, then with AML legislation, it makes all gambling money laundering, but that's not a helpful way of thinking about it. You need to know if people are trying to launder money,” said Michael Levi, professor of criminology at Cardiff University, Wales and author of the 2009 report 'Money Laundering Risks and E-Gaming: A European Overview and Assessment.'</span></span></div><span><span></span></span><br><span><span></span></span><br><div lang="en-GB"><b><span><span>US contradictions</span></span></b></div><br><div lang="en-GB"><span><span>In the US, e-gambling is only allowed in Nevada, New Jersey and Delaware. In theory it is illegal to engage in games of chance online in other states – but with notable exceptions: Native American tribes operate 460 gaming facilities in 28 states, according to the AGA. “The American position on e-gambling seems to be born more from the puritanical roots of the country rather than any particular money laundering concern,” said Mark Methenitis, vice chair of the International Bar Association's (IBA) electronic entertainment and online gaming subcommittee in the US. “However, as we're seeing the beginnings of a shift in the stance, with online gambling legal or soon to be legal in a handful of US states, money laundering may become a more major focus if the legalisation continues to spread.”</span></span><br><br></div><span><span></span></span><b><span><span><span lang="en-GB">Risk assessment</span></span></span></b><br><br><span><span></span></span><span><span><span lang="en-GB">So, what, exactly, are the money laundering risks of e-gambling? Mike Levi holds that, in the EU, they are “comparatively modest due to the high traceability of e-gaming transactions and the customer identification controls in the regulated sector.” Indeed, licensed e-gambling companies have chosen to comply with the existing Third EU AML Directive (3MLD) and adopted codes of conduct issued by the RGA and the European Gaming and Betting Association. Furthermore, the Fourth EU ML Directive proposes a threshold of Euro EUR2,000 (USS</span></span><span>2,728)</span><span><span lang="en-GB">on e-gambling, above which enhanced due diligence needs to be carried out by the website or e-gambling company, which would also be required to file suspicious transaction reports.  </span></span></span><br><span><span></span></span><br><div lang="en-GB"><span><span>Nevertheless risks remain related to micro-laundering and the anonymity that the web can provide: fake identities could potentially be used to open e-gambling accounts. “Remote gaming is a method often used by launderers to move money from one payment gateway to another. The money launderer may not reveal his identity to the gaming firm as multiple accounts using stolen identities can be used to collect his 'winnings', for example, in poker tournaments by ‘chip dumping’ [intentionally losing to another player] - and the multiple accounts often skim beneath regulatory identification reporting thresholds,” said Seona Devaney, director of the consultancy Frisk Online Limited, in the UK. She said the vulnerability arises where e-wallets receive winnings from multiple accounts linked to false identities. Person-to-person transfers are allowed by such systems, and money can be channelled to a central individual (who may actually exist) and who commands a high value transaction limit for collecting payments within an e-wallet: “The main collector may act as an unlicensed e-money exchanger, withdrawing the proceeds of crime, and routing funds elsewhere on request of the launderer,” she said.</span></span></div><span><span></span></span><span><span><span lang="en-GB">Which said, Brendan O'Connor, founder of Malice Afterthought Inc, a US-based security consultancy, believes the risks of e-gambling as a money laundering tool are overstated, although also, he concedes,  difficult to control. </span></span><span>“<span lang="en-GB">In general, attempting to place restrictions on things like e-gambling only prevents law-abiding citizens from gambling, while it doesn't restrict criminal organisations at all. Even if the EU placed a ceiling of EUR5.00 (USD</span>6.82) <span lang="en-GB">per day [on bets], the ability to create a near infinite number of accounts - something not stopped by any identification law, no matter how draconian - would enable criminal organisations to launder money despite the restrictions,” said O'Connor.</span></span></span><br><span><span></span></span><span><span><span lang="en-GB">Jean-Loup Richet, information systems service manager at Orange and Research Fellow at the ESSEC Business School in France, has observed that online gaming is a way to avoid basic AML monitoring, but thinks there is greater potential for money laundering in e-gaming systems that use online currencies. </span></span><span>“<span lang="en-GB">Laundering money into an online game currency is an obfuscation technique, like creating shell companies and corporate vehicles. It reduces global traceability, and it's cheaper and easier - one doesn't need a lawyer that can give him up, doesn't need straw men and so on.” Moreover, it is less regulated than e-gambling per se, said Richet. </span></span></span><br><br><i><span><span><span lang="en-GB">Photo credit: Jamie Adams, Wikimedia Commons </span></span></span></i><br><span><span> </span></span>";s:17:"post_image_height";i:500;s:16:"post_image_width";i:750;s:11:"post_visits";i:9;s:18:"post_twitterShares";i:0;s:19:"post_facebookShares";i:0;s:16:"post_totalShares";i:0;s:16:"post_socialScore";i:10;s:13:"post_virality";i:2;s:9:"blog_name";s:14:"Back in Beirut";s:16:"blog_description";s:67:"Articles and snapshots: Lebanon, the Middle East and further afield";s:8:"blog_url";s:33:"http://backinbeirut.blogspot.com/";s:11:"blog_author";s:13:"Paul Cochrane";s:28:"blog_author_twitter_username";N;s:13:"blog_rss_feed";s:52:"http://backinbeirut.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default";s:9:"blog_tags";s:14:"tech, business";s:2:"id";i:9;s:11:"blog_active";i:1;s:24:"blog_last_post_timestamp";i:1399376460;}i:14;O:8:"stdClass":26:{s:7:"post_id";i:29044;s:8:"post_url";s:36:"http://lebaneseblogs.com/blog/?p=232";s:10:"post_title";s:52:"Bloggers: Add a Lebanese Blogs Badge To your Website";s:10:"post_image";s:42:"http://www.lebaneseblogs.com/img/badge.png";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:123:"Only the best Lebanese Blogs are part of our website, so carrying our badge will be a mark of excellence to all your vis...";s:7:"blog_id";s:13:"lebaneseblogs";s:14:"post_timestamp";i:1399361340;s:12:"post_content";s:555:"<p><img src="http://www.lebaneseblogs.com/img/badge.png" width="200px" height="200px"></p>

Yet my research have been fought by almost everyone. Companies only care about shutting me up and have a hard time  fixing the bugs that I mention. Nobody is taking the matter of security in a serious way, they want to wait for the problem to happen and get lost, then fix it. Rather than doing their best to prevent the problem from happening in the first place.<span></span></p><p><a href="http://www.ultgate.com/web/wp-content/uploads/technology-health.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[4056]"><img src="http://www.ultgate.com/web/wp-content/uploads/technology-health-300x168.jpg" alt="technology health 300x168 Lets Clear The Air: Youre Still Not Secure." width="300" height="168" title="Lets Clear The Air: Youre Still Not Secure."></a></p><p>I mean almost non of the companies affected have hired a testing/security company. And although I’ve been “donating” my time to meet with companies, they only seem to care the bugs i published about. A huge part of my research was not released to anyone yet, most of our websites don’t have the basic security measurement, major development companies are selling crap and everybody else is clueless.</p><h2>MD5 Encryption is not Secure:</h2><p>Everybody is asking me about the remaining bugs in the payment systems. Although proving that md5 is insecure is a very easy process, I am gonna rely on Wikipedia this time.</p><p>According to wikipedia ” <strong>The security of the MD5 hash function is severely compromised.</strong> A collision attack exists that can find collisions within seconds on a computer with a 2.6 GHz Pentium 4 processor (complexity of <sup>2</sup>). Further, there is also a chosen-prefix collision attack that can produce a collision for two inputs with specified prefixes within hours, using off-the-shelf computing hardware (complexity 2). The ability to find collisions has been greatly aided by the use of off-the-shelf GPUs. On an NVIDIA GeForce 8400GS graphics processor, 16–18 million hashes per second can be computed. An NVIDIA GeForce 8800 Ultra can calculate more than 200 million hashes per second. <strong>These hash and collision attacks have been demonstrated in the public in various situations, including colliding document files and digital certificates.</strong>”</p><p>In other words, hacking md5 encryption is pretty much easy.  Unfortunately most of our systems are outdated and still rely on md5 encryption being sent using the user’s browser. A 5 years old with a high tech laptop can easily hack that. I’m talking here about bills, payment gateways, and confidential info.

</section><p>Microsoft Lebanon held this year’s Microsoft Imagine Cup at the ministry of Education and Higher Education’ conference room under the patronage of his Excellency Minister of Education and Higher Education Elie Bou Saab, represented by the ministry’s Head of IT, ENG. Toufic Karam. The 18 participating teams included students from the following universities: Arts, Science & Technology University in Lebanon (AUL), Lebanese International University (LIU), Rafic Hariri University (RHU), Beirut Arab University (BAU), Lebanese American University (LAU), American University of Science and Technology (AUST), and the American University of Beirut (AUB).</p>
<p>On the occasion, Mr Toufic Karam explained that Microsoft’s objectives through the competition fall in line with the ministry’s initiative to transform educational and technological projects into job opportunities. This includes spreading a culture of entrepreneurship, starting from the school curriculums and spreading out to universities in the aim of transforming student potential into innovative ideas prone to execution.</p>
<p>With Microsoft’s continuous efforts to support the Lebanese educational sector, Microsoft is offering students the opportunity to become successful business leaders in the global market at a very young age. Also through Microsoft BizSpark program, participants have the ability to launch startup businesses in their communities and across the Web.</p>
<blockquote><p>Microsoft Lebanon is constantly working to create a wider workplace and help students find the jobs they love. Through Imagine Cup 2014, we aim to highlight the potential of students who have demonstrated the very best in innovation. We stand confident in Lebanon’s youth impact around the world, as education remains Microsoft’s priority in empowering local students with the tools necessary to transition into the working world and create new job opportunities.</p>
<p>Hoda Younan, Microsoft Lebanon Country Manager</p></blockquote>
<p>The end of the competition, which revolved around 3 categories, games, citizenship, and innovation, saw the selection of 3 winners for each category by a panel of judges comprised of MrWadih Tueni, CIO An Nahar Newspaper, Mr Amer Tabsh, Future TV show iKnow host, Mr Ghady Rayess, CEO FOO, Mr Nabil Bou Ghanem, President ISOC Lebanon, Mr Walid Mansour, Managing Director Middle East Venture Partners (MEVP), Mr Fouad Rahme, Head of BLC Invest, and Mr Abdallah Jabbour, Managing Director Lebanon For Entrepreneurs (LFE).</p>
<p>“Today, businesses face significant opportunities and challenges,” said Ghassan Chahine, Microsoft DPE lead. “With Imagine Cup 2014, Microsoft is creating learning opportunities for students engaged in IT development to help them become young entrepreneurs starting new businesses.”</p>
<p>The winning teams in Citizenship and Innovation categories will be travelling to Qatar to compete with 22 other countries in the Imagine Cup Arab Semi Finals. In the event of winning the Arab Semi Finals, the team will progress to go to Microsoft Headquarters in Seattle to compete with more than 35 countries from around the world over four days for the top prizes. As for the winners in the Games category, they will be competing globally with hundreds of other teams online.</p>
<p>The winning teams commented on the event: “Imagine Cup is a fantastic opportunity to showcase our projects in front of the biggest business leaders, technology specialists, and media representatives. Most importantly, Microsoft’s support is helping us build the skills necessary to succeed and advance in our careers. Moreover, this competition is giving us the chance to travel to a new country and meet new students like us who are striving to achieve their dreams around the world.”</p>
<p>As for this year’s winning teams, who demonstrated fascinating projects, were announced as follows:</p>
<ul><li>For the category of innovation: Beirut Arab University (BAU) for their project Inveeno, which revolves around developing a line of educational and prototyping kits for teaching and creating automation, programming, and robotics in an easy and engaging way. <em>Team members: Mohammad Issa and Ahmad Chahine.</em></li>
<li>For the category of Citizenship: Rafic Hariri University (RHU) for their project ReminDrug which aims at reminding old people to get the right medicine at the right time. When it’s time to take the drug, the phone will remind the patient and the right pill with the right amount will be dropped from their hardware device. <em>Team members: Jad Ashour, Rayan Atmeh, Salah Al Jammal, and Ahmad Abou Daher.</em></li>
<li>For the category of Games: Rafic Hariri University (RHU) for their project Hatch N Catch, an educational game for all ages where players must run to solve questions with different levels once the phones tap together. <em>Team members: Khaled Sabra, Ziad Ballouz, Nada Chaarawi, and Rami Al Shoura.</em></li>

<p>Whenever I write about the end of paper media (paper books, newspapers, magazines..etc), I get serious push-back from friends and readers, some of whom strongly disagreeing with me and arguing in favor of paper. In response to my <a href="http://mustapha.me/2014/04/the-day-i-stopped-reading-newspapers/">newspaper post</a>, my friend Samer <a href="https://www.facebook.com/mustapha/posts/10154027788970332?comment_id=10154028398805332&offset=0&total_comments=9">writes</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>“I love reading the paper. it is called a paper cause u hold it in ur hands, spread it, jumble it up, curse at it because the page wont fold the right way, and just let your eyes feed on the words in it. Reading online is nice but is not the same”</p></blockquote>
<p>Today, in a blog post entitled <a href="http://www.joesbox.com/2014/05/paper-is-not-dead.html">“Paper is not dead”</a> (which I suspect is partly a response to mine), my pal Joe <a href="http://www.joesbox.com/2014/05/paper-is-not-dead.html">writes</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>” I love books and I don’t think I can ever read a whole book on a screen, no matter what size. I love printed magazines, I love the content, design, look and it is a pleasure flipping through it. I think books or magazines just feel like the right format for reading a large amount of content.”</p></blockquote>
<p>I’m not going to lie to you, I also like the smell and feel of paper, but our feelings and nostalgia are completely unrelated to a discussion about the future of paper as a medium of distributing information and entertainment. </p>
<h3>Slow Process</h3>
<p>What we are going through here is the slow process of obsolescence of a technology that has been around for thousands of years. This is not something that will happen overnight or even over a generation. Paper is already out in some fields (accounting, banking, travel services) and it is still hanging on in others (books, some publications). But eventually, bits and screens will replace paper in the same way that paper replaced stone slabs (a process that also took several generations). Meanwhile, we are bound to have lingering emotional attachments to the technology we grew up with, but our children and their children will be free of such attachments. </p>
<p>I always like to bring up horses and cars in this argument. When cars replaced horses, also a “technology” that had been around for thousands of years, there were many people who were protesting, using arguments similar to Samer’s and Joe’s. But while the Horse’s smell, the bonding with the animal and the relaxing sound of galloping are all fine things, they are unrelated to the process of transportation, in which the car is much more efficient and convenient (despite being noisy and smelling of burned hydrocarbons).</p>
<p>Yesterday my wife and I decided that our 5-year-old son should start reading books. We didn’t put on new clothes, drive to a library and look for something for him to read. We just opened iBooks on his iPad and got him a really fun book (that he loved). This is what he and many in his generation will be having fuzzy emotions for when they grow up.</p>
