<p>I am sure you’ve all seen the <a href="http://blogbaladi.com/wen-el-dawle/">above picture</a> by now. As <a href="http://www.isf.gov.lb/ar/article/1179/%D8%AA%D9%88%D8%B6%D9%8A%D8%AD">confirmed</a> by the ISF, it is not a fake photo but a real one and there are reasons why the ISF motorist did not stop the young man.</p>
<p>Here’s what the ISF had to say about this incident:<br>
- On 13/07/2014 one of the Baabda ISF motorists was on the Naameh highway, when a civilian started making stunts with his bike right next to him. The policeman ordered him to stop the stunts several times but the biker didn’t cooperate. That’s when the policeman tried to arrest him but the biker sped away and the policeman stayed behind for safety purposes.<br>
- Necessary disciplinary measures were taken against the policeman.<br>
- Baabda ISF branch is committed to the safety of the drivers and is constantly patrolling the “Costa Brava – Khaldeh” highway.</p>
<p>I think the policeman should have chased the young man or called for reinforcements, but I love the fact that the ISF actually investigated the matter and clarified the issue through its social media channels. I really hope they will keep on listening to what the people have to say and take actions, because that’s the only way to build (a much needed) trust between the police and the citizens.</p>

It took about a couple of hours before the new Airbnb logo would become the ridicule of the design community - much has been read into it: A phallic symobl, check, a widened vagina, check, boobs, check, and the list goes. The fact that is resembles closely two other logos (N3twork and Automation Anywhere) does not help.<br>
Note that this is not the first time a new logo gets a desatrous welcome - Gap suffered major backlash upon releasing theirs, heck, the whole country of Poland also had to retract a new redesigned logo, and (lest we forget) the <a href="http://beirutntsc.blogspot.com/2011/03/are-we-getting-too-carried-away.html">Saudi Arilines</a>.<br>

<p dir="LTR">I strongly disagree after two weeks of interviews here in Beirut with a wide range of officials from all sides including hizbullah. Indeed, why should the party by “disappointed?”</p>
<p dir="LTR">Hamas is trying to do the impossible by fighting on essentially a small beach of territory some few kilometers wide, with ZERO depth, with rockets that <strong>pale</strong> in comparison to both the AMOUNT and TYPE that hizbullah possesses (the swarm effect and the better tech is what Hizbullah is likely banking on for the next conflict , even if davids sling is introduced).</p>
<p dir="LTR">Bottom line: Hamas’s fight now is NOT being viewed as anything close to a test run of the next Hizbullah-Israel war.</p>
<p dir="LTR">One useful thing this analyst says however: he acknowledges something which is largely NEVER reported on but which is crucial to analysing the balance of power in the region. Hamas is mimicking Hizbullah’s approach to target MILITARY installations as a key aspect of their campaign. From al-monitor:</p>
<p dir="LTR">****************</p>
<p dir="LTR">At the outset of the conflict, Hamas attempted a “shock and awe campaign,” including tunnel-borne kidnapping raids under the Israeli border, navel commando incursions and drone attacks meant to degrade Israeli morale. According to experts who spoke to Al-Monitor, this is the same strategy that Hezbollah would likely employ in the first days of a future conflict with Israel. Israel thwarted all of Hamas’ surprises, including the <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/7/14/5897665/israel-shoots-down-hamas-drone" target="_blank">armed drone</a> incursion.</p>
<p dir="LTR">Hamas’ rocket infrastructure, meanwhile, is now nearly identical to that of Hezbollah’s in Lebanon, apart from the smaller numbers and sophistication of projectiles. Unlike past conflicts, most of Hamas’ rocket launchers are concealed under the sands of Gaza or in sensitive civilian areas, with local cells using motorcycles to dart between firing positions. One can imagine that Hezbollah is watching how a frustrated Hamas repeatedly fails in its attempts to confuse and overwhelm Israel’s air-defense Iron Dome system with coordinated rocket barrages over large areas at a time. <strong>While the media is restricted from reporting such attacks, it has been widely claimed by Hamas that many of their rockets have been fired toward the vicinity of key air force bases of Tel Nof, Hatzor, Hatzerim and Nevatim in an attempt to hit runways and stifle Israeli air force bombing. During the 2006 conflict, Hezbollah focused much of its fire on hitting the Ramat David air base in northern Israel’s Jezreel Valley, hitting the runway in at least one instance.</strong></p>
