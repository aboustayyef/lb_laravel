The GCC leads this, with the UAE, KSA and Qatar on the digital ad market leaderboard.</p>
<p>Global interest in mobile advertising is also surging: mobile ad spend grew 105% in 2013 and is expected to reach $31.5B globally.  This is also mirrored in MENA, where mobile ads grew by 58% to reach $85 million this year (compared to $50 million last year). “Smartphone penetration and hours spent online in the Arab world, and the GCC in particular, are amongst the highest worldwide,” says Zafer Younis, co-founder at The Online Project. “Traditional media in these countries is still heavily controlled and monitored by the government. So, I do expect our region to be fast in switching to digital. The consumers have already made the shift, advertiser will follow shortly.”</p>
<p>The increasing interest in digital and mobile advertising is disrupting the traditional business of ad agencies, many of whom are restructuring their organizations and building digital capacities to enable them to better serve their clients’ digital marketing needs.  Chief Innovation Officers, like Roychaudhury and Yousef Tuqan of Leo Burnett, are in many cases charged with leading this transformation.  “We have seen the steady evolution of communications & content from analog to digital, and from digital to mobile and social,” states Tuqan.  “Any successful communicator, in the GCC or anywhere else, must adapt to this new paradigm.”</p>
<p>Digital marketing and advertising are key topics that will be discussed in depth at the upcoming ArabNet Digital Summit, taking place on June 3-5 at Atlantis Hotel, The Palm, Dubai.  The conference will include Ad+Tech Academy, a full day of workshops on digital, social, mobile, and video advertising. ArabNet’s summit is set to convene more than 1,000 executives, investors, entrepreneurs, and media from the four corners of the world. More than 130 speakers will gather during the event to discuss the latest digital opportunities shaping the Arab digital industry.</p>

<p>Surely, I had to keep all students on equal footsteps especially for students who might be behind the class due to being slow writers or simply late because of being distracted.<span></span></p>
<p>On that basis a few months ago I decided to try out something new in my physics classroom. Since I was heavily using Evernote for note taking and organization and sharing some of these notes [3] (as a matter of fact I am writing this and other posts on Evernote) I decided it would be great if my students could check their agenda online.</p>
<p>Moreover, I thought this would also give parents an easy way to check what their children hav taken in class, what they have for homework, that quizzes or exams were distributed & require their signing, and if they have a quiz or exam. As a matter of fact I am mainly using this online agenda to post details and due dates about</p>
<ul><li>Assignments</li>
<li>Quizzes</li>
<li>Exams</li>
<li>Handouts in PDF (though they are handed copies in class)</li>
<li>Corrections to assignments and assessments</li>
<li>a detention list</li>
</ul><p>To do this I created a new notebook, named the “<strong>Online Physics Agenda – school-abbreviation grade-abbreviation</strong>” and added it to the stack of notebooks (a <a href="https://evernote.com/premium/" target="_blank">premium feature</a>) that I created for this particular school and started adding notes to it. Each note is an agenda page for a particular date. I’ll detail how I organize notebooks in a future post. Each note I create has the following title format</p>
<blockquote><p>2014-04-23 Short meaningful title – Due April 28 (Monday)</p></blockquote>
<p>where 2014-04-23 is the creation date of the note. I am aware that each note has the date in its metadata but I wanted the date to be obvious to parents & students without the need of clicking or sorting.</p>
<p>Though I’ve enjoyed this system but I still write the agenda in class and ask the students to write it down at the beginning of each class. In this manner both students who miss to write everything or were absent can check it online. This also gives another important advantage, keeping all parents up to date on their kid’s responsibilities.</p>
<p>For students & parents to access it I had to, obviously, provide them with a link. Since links from Evernote are often long and take the following form</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="http://www.evernote.com/pub/username/original-name-of-notebook/" rel="nofollow">http://www.evernote.com/pub/username/original-name-of-notebook/</a></p></blockquote>
<p>I had to shorten the link and make it easy to access the notebook. I opted to shorten the URL with <a href="http://goo.gl/" target="_blank">goo.gl</a> (another alternative is <a href="https://bitly.com/" target="_blank">bitly</a>) which returns the link in the following form</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="http://goo.gl/some-random-letters" rel="nofollow">http://goo.gl/some-random-letters</a></p></blockquote>
<p>What makes the Google url shortner useful is the statistics that it offers and QR code it generates for the shortened link. To check it append “.info” (without the quotations) to your shortened link like this</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://goo.gl/some-random-letters.info" rel="nofollow">http://goo.gl/some-random-letters.info</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Since at first I didn’t know about the goo.gl statistics page & QR code it generates I generated a QR code using the <a href="https://www.the-qrcode-generator.com/" target="_blank">QR Code Generator</a> (<a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/the-qr-code-generator/gcmhlmapohffdglflokbgknlknnmogbb" target="_blank">available as a Chrome app for offline use</a>).</p>
<div></div>
<p>Finally I printed out a note that includes the shortened link (without the http:// part)  “goo.gl/some-random-letters”, the QR code and a note that informs the students of two Android & IOS Barcode reader apps if they wish to scan the code.</p>
<p>Important notes that I wish to surface (when sorted by tittle) are prefixed by an exclamation mark (!)</p>
<p>Having done this I have also informed the principal about it who liked it and I requested that the parents be informed. Even students liked it and asked whether it’s for all subjects.</p>
<p>So far this initiative has been semi-successful for the two main reasons:</p>
<ol><li>the statistics show that just part of the students are actively checking the online agenda.<br>
I believe this is mainly because it’s the first time someone tries it at this school and students haven’t built a habit of regularly checking their online agenda. This (building the habit) is something I am already working on by requiring them to check it every Friday and gradually increasing their dependence on it.<br>
I will employ next year from the start of the year and that it will be more successful when they are told about it from day one.</li>
<li>The Evernote notebook sometimes takes too much time to load and sometimes it doesn’t even load fast enough. Some student have complained about that but I am not why this is happening not just to shared notebooks but also to the main or sign-in pages.<br>
To make the notebook faster at loading I stopped adding images to the notes which tend to  slow the loading of a note, and instead I am using PDF’s which require a click to open or download.</li>
</ol><p>Of course this is not a substitute to the student agenda, not this year at least, but  a compliment which is especially useful for absent students and student’s parents.<br>
Other than that I will be suggesting this idea to other teachers particularly the English teachers.</p>

While a anti-terrorism bill has now been passed, shortcomings still remain and new risks have emerged in Turkey's difficult <span lang="en-GB">neighbourhood.</span>Ongoing political wrangling and a corruption scandal present further challenges, including the independence of the judiciary.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>It was in February 2009 that the AML/CTF standard-setter gave Ankara to pass new laws on terrorist financing. This did not happen and in October 2012, Turkey was told it had three months to comply with the Recommendations on terror finance or face suspension from FATF. Specifically, Turkey is required to establish a “legal framework for identifying and freezing terrorist assets" meeting its guidance, notably Recommendation 6, and its Interpretive Note 6 on freezing, “without delay and without prior notice, the funds of other assets of designated person and entities.”</span></div><div><br></div><div><b><span>Not before time</span></b></div><div><span> </span></div><div><span>In February 2013, at the eleventh hour, Ankara passed a domestically-controversial bill under which any individual or entity financially aiding terrorists, even if the money is not “used for an illegal activity,” faces five to 10 years in prison. The law authorizes the Finance Ministry’s Financial Crimes Investigation Board (MASAK) to freeze the assets of those involved in terrorist financing in Turkey or abroad without the need to first obtain a judicial ruling. </span></div><div><span> </span></div><div>“<span>I think the FATF observation was valid, as we didn't have the legal framework to confiscate or freeze assets on international watch lists or the red flag mechanism for suspicious transaction reports (STRs),” said Atilla Yesilada, an Istanbul-based analyst at Global Source Partners Inc. “The final warning of FATF has strengthened the legislative framework but it is very clear that Turkey doesn't have a very tight supervision on AML and on CTF. We live in a country where impunity exists.”</span></div><div><br></div><div><b><span>Still to do</span></b><br></div><div></div><div><span>Indeed, despite the new CTF law, a FATF public statement, issued in February, 2014, stated, “certain concerns remain, and Turkey should take further steps to implement an adequate legal framework for identifying and freezing terrorist assets” under United Nations Security Council Resolutions (UNSCRs) 1267 and 1373.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>Such shortcomings places Turkey alongside Yemen, Algeria and Syria in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) in having what FATF terms “strategic AML and CTF deficiencies.” As such, Turkey is lagging behind many of its MENA peers. </span></div><div><span> </span></div><div>“<span>On a comparative level, Turkey needs to update its regime to be in line with the rest of the region,” said Hossam M. Abd El-Rahman, Chairman and Managing Director of Allied Compliance Consultants  in Dubai, which specializes in financial crime, consultancy and training in the MENA. “Turkey is falling behind in Recommendation 6, proper risk management, Recommendation 7, regarding financing of proliferation, and in others, such as Recommendations 11 and 12, on measures to be taken to prevent ML and TF. There are a lot of deficiencies, and all these gaps need to be filled up quickly.”</span></div><div><br></div><div><span><b>Taxing questions </b></span></div><div><br></div><div><span><span>A further issue to be addressed are the tax amnesties Ankara introduced to repatriate capital. In 2008 and 2009, tax amnesties attracted some US$27 billion in assets, according to government statistics. In 2013, a third amnesty was introduced, with Ankara wanting to attract US</span></span>$130 billion in untaxed assets kept offshore by Turkish taxpayers. Controversially, the Finance Ministry stated there would be no tax investigation or retroactive tax assessments, although criminal investigations could be launched if there is suspicion of ML. </div><div><br></div><div>“This wealth amnesty has completely undermined the system,” said <span><span>Yesilada. “</span></span>Part of the money brought in as being of “Turkish origin” may actually be borrowed or given to them by non-Turkish entities or cartels with no questions asked, and laundered in Turkey. These amnesties ask no questions and you just have to show a certificate of deposit that the money belongs to you, which is easy to get. It is a disgrace not to find out the source of that money, as there's no idea of its nature.”</div><div><br></div><div><b>Trouble at the top</b><br></div><div></div><div>Compounding regulatory and enforcement issues is the ongoing political wrangling between the ruling AKP party of Prime Minister Recep Erdogan, which has faced mass demonstrations over the past year, and the opposition. In December (2013), allegations of corruption among Erdogan's circle emerged following a police investigation, including a scandal that his son, Bilal, met with Saudi Arabian businessman Yasin Al-Qadi, whom the United States blacklisted via its Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) as a "specially designated global terrorist," freezing his assets on 12 October 2001.  </div><div><br></div><div>Another high-profile case involves Iranian-Turkish national Reza Zerrab, who is alleged in another police investigation to have launder billions of dollars for Iranian businessmen in a “oil for gold deal,” with commissions paid out to the Economy Minister (an alleged US$49 million), the CEO of the partly state-owned  bank Halbank (US$7.7 million), and people close to the AKP. Zerrab was arrested in December 2013, and faces money laundering, corruption and fraud charges. </div><div><br></div><div><b>Political push and pull</b></div><div><br></div><div>Depending on how these cases turn out (and the government has made allegations that they are politically motivated), they could put pressure on Turkey's financial and business world to clean up its AML act. Abd El-Rahman said: <style type="text/css">P { margin-bottom: 0.08in; direction: ltr; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-align: left; }P.western { font-family: "Liberation Serif","Times New Roman",serif; font-size: 12pt; }P.cjk { font-family: "DejaVu Sans"; font-size: 12pt; }P.ctl { font-family: "DejaVu Sans"; font-size: 12pt; }A:link {  }</style>“The corruption case will seriously affect the banks, and companies will have to do a lot of effort to boost compliance.”  </div><div><br></div><div>But political plays are in motion that could mean the opposite. The Speaker of Parliament, Cemil Cicek, for instance, said in January that there is no independent judicial review in Turkey, while a bill is being debated that would restructure the Supreme Board of Judges and Prosecutors (HSYK).</div><div>However, Professor Recep Pekdemir, a faculty member of the Istanbul Business School at Istanbul University, believes this issue will be sorted out. “The judiciary issue will be <span lang="en-GB">stabilised</span> soon, it's only a fight between politicians. If the country is <span lang="en-GB">stabilised</span>there can be more control over illicit activities, but right now the government is focused on internal matters rather than external matters,” he said.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Syria - unknown quantity</b><br></div><div>Externally, Ankara is having to deal with the changing political environment in the Middle East: the West's relations are warming with sanctioned Iran while the conflict in <span lang="en-GB">neighbouring</span> Syria has seen hundreds of thousands of refugees flooded into the country since 2011. There are also allegations of Turkey supporting Islamic rebel movements in Syria.</div><div>“Ankara denies it but everyone knows that Ankara is sending arms and money to the Syrian Islamic Front and Jabhat Al Nusra, and there are millions of Syrian refugees in the country; who they are and what they are living on no one knows,” said <span><span>Yesilada. “There may be blow back for Turkey, </span></span>and Syrian groups are allied with (the blacklisted terrorist group) Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which is bad news. How can smuggling be stopped?”</div><div><br></div><div>Turkey has many challenges ahead to bolster its AML regime in addition to curbing the country's role as a trans-shipment hub for drugs, human trafficking and smuggling. “Turkey has many <span lang="en-GB">neighbouring</span> countries which have been having troubles with not only terrorism but also human trafficking, illicit crime and money laundering. As Turkey is uniquely positioned on two continents, it is difficult to solve such issues,” said Pekdemir.</div>";s:17:"post_image_height";i:0;s:16:"post_image_width";i:0;s:11:"post_visits";i:2;s:18:"post_twitterShares";i:0;s:19:"post_facebookShares";i:0;s:16:"post_totalShares";i:0;s:16:"post_socialScore";i:3;s:13:"post_virality";i:2;s:9:"blog_name";s:14:"Back in Beirut";s:16:"blog_description";s:67:"Articles and snapshots: Lebanon, the Middle East and further afield";s:8:"blog_url";s:33:"http://backinbeirut.blogspot.com/";s:11:"blog_author";s:13:"Paul Cochrane";s:28:"blog_author_twitter_username";N;s:13:"blog_rss_feed";s:52:"http://backinbeirut.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default";s:9:"blog_tags";s:14:"tech, business";s:2:"id";i:9;s:11:"blog_active";i:1;s:24:"blog_last_post_timestamp";i:1399376460;}i:4;O:8:"stdClass":26:{s:7:"post_id";i:28644;s:8:"post_url";s:102:"http://lfadi.wordpress.com/2014/04/28/lindsay-lohan-and-haifa-wehbe-are-so-excited-to-meet-each-other/";s:10:"post_title";s:63:"Lindsay Lohan and Haifa Wehbe are so excited to meet each other";s:10:"post_image";s:47:"http://lfadi.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/11.png";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:123:"

This 4-year-old blog, which is run by Gino Raidy has been read over a million times and won the Best Personal Blog Award at Beirut’s Social Media Awards 2013. It is both the most praised and most criticized blog in Lebanon. In this interview, I will be addressing some of the rumors about this blog as well as some insights from Gino’s experience.<p></p></span></div><div><br></div><div><span>Gino is a 23 year old blogger who currently works as a freelance journalist and fixer for several foreign press agencies in Lebanon. </span></div><div><b><span><br></span></b></div><div><span><b>Tell us the story of why you started your blog and how it became so quickly one of the most read blogs in Lebanon?</b><span><p></p></span></span></div><div><br></div><div><span>The blog started out as an extra credit assignment in a creative writing course at AUB in January 2010. The first post I wrote was about scouts and how important it was in my life, and why I think it helped so many people growing up. It got somewhere like 2000 hits in the first month, and I was like "wow, people are actually reading something I wrote!" So, I bought the domain name (which isn't that creative, I know) and started experimenting. I kept what worked, omitted what didn't. And its popularity slowly started growing.<span><p></p></span></span></div><div><br></div><div><span>It actually took over a year to really pick up. The rise wasn't as meteoric as some people might think, and there is no secret to how it got there. Just write original content, share it on social media and if it's good, it'll get around on its own.<span><p></p></span></span></div><div><br></div><div><span><b>How did you spread awareness about your blog online and offline?</b><span><p></p></span></span></div><div><br></div><div><span>Facebook. I owe a lot to this social network. I share it there, it is seen by my friends. If someone likes it, they share, their friends see it, and that's how you get the word out and get your blog recognized. Not ads, not hashtags, not asking people to check it out. Just try your best to write good stuff and share it, hoping it might help others, entertain them or just give them a chance to vent and know that they're not the only ones thinking or feeling a certain way about an issue or event.<span><p></p></span></span></div><div><br></div><div><span><b>You said, "The self-proclaimed Lebanese online community never really liked me." Can you elaborate on who are these "self-proclaimed" people and why do they not like you?</b><span><p></p></span></span></div><div><br></div><div><span>I started out as somewhat of an outsider to the Lebanese online community. I had never read a blog before starting my own, and I'm ashamed to say I rarely read other blogs today unless it's super interesting and I stumble upon it on LebaneseBlogs.com. <span><p></p></span></span></div><div><span><span>                                    <p></p></span></span></div><div><span>I guess when you're not in the online "social media guru" business, the love doesn't go around as much and is usually portrayed on Twitter, or in the comments on the blog (which I never, ever delete, no matter how inappropriate or insulting. Freedom of Speech #FTW). I don't mind, though, as long as it's starting a conversation, I favorite and RT these insults and attacks, because I have nothing to hide, and as a staunch advocate of freedom of speech and anti-censorship, I should practice what I preach and never censor or delete anything. <span><p></p></span></span></div><div><br></div><div><span><span><br></span></span></div><div><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Up53EvNg5jY/U102bfk4TxI/AAAAAAAADzc/S5Qu_QqVws4/s1600/IMG_20140311_013946.jpg" height="640" width="640"></div><div><br></div><div><span><b>How do you keep your blog credible? How can your readers be sure that what you say is true, especially when reviewing brands? And how would you respond to people who say that brands bribe you with invites, gifts or money get the best treatment on your blog and when they upset you, you put them on your black list?</b><span><p></p></span></span></div><div><br></div><div><span>Simple. People can try for themselves. When I review a place or product, anyone can go and see for themselves that my kind, or harsh, review was fair and accurate. As for the "bribes" that have many people worried, there are two important things to remember here. The first, is <i>always</i> tell your readers what's happening. If I get an invite or product to try out, I make it public and share the news, so that if I ever do end up writing about it, people know how I got the chance to. Second, make sure the brands and companies know you owe them nothing. Even if they offer me my weight in gold (which is a LOT btw), if their product sucks, I'll say it or just never bother reviewing it because it's that lame.<span><p></p></span></span></div><div><br></div><div><span>As for money, I have never, and will never get paid for a post. It just feels wrong, and I can't write something I'm not wholeheartedly convinced of, or feel is being "imposed" on me by some gift or invite. The popularity of the blog has made reviewing spots objectively harder, so, as you may have noticed, the reviews are much, much less. When I get a call to try out a new restaurant for free, I usually don't go, and if I do, I don't write about it. But, if I really want to review it, I apologize, call again and book under another person's name to get the real feel of the place, so folks won't be "they paid him" if it's a good review, or "he has a personal issue with them" if it's a bad one. <span><p></p></span></span></div><div><br></div><div><span>So, I guess the answer to your question about credibility is, people can try for themselves, and I am confident they'll see my input and feedback was honest. Also, be honest about who you are and what you think. There's no shame in having a strong opinion about an issue or a product or a company.<span><p></p></span></span></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><span><b>Tell us about the times that you got in trouble because you voiced your opinion on your blog and about any updates with latest incident with BONOFA. Some people even said that you "fled the country" because of this</b><span><p></p></span></span></div><div><br></div><div><span>I utterly despise the "slander and libel" laws in Lebanon and how people and companies misuse them to intimidate. I've had a handful of lawsuits, but don't publicize that as much. I hate being "the victim" or "the martyr" like other online folks might market themselves as. Only two lawsuits ever became public, and that was because I was genuinely worried for my well-being, and got it out enough to make sure my rights are safeguarded, and then tried to quiet it down and move on quickly, cause again, I hate the "persecuted activist" vibe. <span><p></p></span></span></div><div><br></div><div><span>I'd much rather handle the cases properly, by proving my point and pressuring the legal apparatus to punish the perpetrators of a crime, not someone who reported on it. Personally, I hate the fact people try to shut me up, so I do everything within my power (peacefully and legally, of course) to try and get the "dirt" on them to the right hands and get their operations closed down. I'm also planning a couple of "3otl w darar" (damages) lawsuits against the would-be silencers to hopefully set an example that you can't use money and corruption to shut innocent people up, and that there is a price to doing that (so, police and judiciary, fail me not, or I go public!). I'd love to go into more details, but my lawyers are already going to scold me for saying this much before the cases have been closed. <span><p></p></span></span></div><div><br></div><div><span>As for me fleeing the country, that's silly. It'll take a lot more than a slander and libel case to get rid of me. I make regular extended trips to the U.S., this is nothing new. I'll be back before the summer season kicks off to cover all the cool parties going down, don't worry!<span><p></p></span></span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-_-HKXgVymds/U102R1i7mHI/AAAAAAAADzM/f_R1Iv4kBq8/s1600/IMG_20140118_160502.jpg" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-_-HKXgVymds/U102R1i7mHI/AAAAAAAADzM/f_R1Iv4kBq8/s1600/IMG_20140118_160502.jpg" height="640" width="640"></a></div><div><br></div><div><span><b>How do you keep your content fresh? And what do you respond to people who say that you write provocative posts just to get more hits on your blog and claim that your readership has decreased</b><span><p></p></span></span></div><div><br></div><div><span>I'm past the hits phase. If they get low, it does bother me of course and motivates me to find something cool to share and write about. However, the posts I write are always because I am genuinely interested in them or feel the need to shed light on them. Sometimes, a post I'd never expect to, goes viral, and others which I expect to hit, tank big time.<span><p></p></span></span></div><div><br></div><div><span>I believe you are referring to controversial posts like the ones criticizing the brutal crackdown on pot smokers in Lebanon. This has been a theme I've covered for the past 3 years, and I doubt the blog has been decreasing in popularity all throughout. It's also something I am actively working for offline: curbing police brutality and reforming the judiciary. <span><p></p></span></span></div><div><br></div><div><span>Sometimes, I just post less cause I'm too busy or need a break or underwent site maintenance. The hits are as solid as ever, and I'm expecting them to go back to the levels they were before my latest trip to the U.S. the minute I land and start pounding the pavement for new stories.<span><p></p></span></span></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><span><b>Advertising on your blog has increased over the years. Can you explain why you decided to monetize your blog and how did people react to it?</b><span><p></p></span></span></div><div><br></div><div><span>Yes, it has, and honestly, it's nowhere near what I think the blog deserves. The time and effort I put into the blog, and the costs of operating it (whether it’s the cost of data consumption or hosting, etc.) are rising now that it's independently hosted and mobile apps are in the works. I'm not rich, though, so being able to raise revenue from allotted and clearly marked ad space is not much of a problem. Till now, though, the market hasn't been that booming when it comes to online ads on blogs, but, it's getting there, and I see no problem with it as long as it doesn't affect content in any possible way (which is made clear to advertisers from the start).<span><p></p></span></span></div><div><br></div><div><span><b>How did your blog contribute positively to your life? And what is some advice you give to people who are on the fence about creating their own blogs?</b><span><p></p></span></span></div><div><br></div><div><span>It's changed my life. I started out as a Biology pre-med student at AUB, and since then, I've been through many jobs and projects I would have never imagined myself in. My love for neuroscience is still there, but at this moment in my life, I'm trying to  pursue a career in journalism that'll hopefully be able to finance my dream of a behavioral neuroscience research lab in Lebanon, which I proposed last year on the blog and got amazing feedback on.<span><p></p></span></span></div><div><br></div><div><span>As for someone thinking of starting a blog, I say stop thinking and do it, now. Choose a name and write your first post. The more people who blog, the better. Never try to start a "successful" blog, just write what you care about and love, and if it's good, it'll pick up on its own. Don't do it just to add it to your resumes and get free stuff. That's peanuts compared to the impact a viral post might have on the folks who read your content. Plus, you're fooling no one. Don't blog just to blog, blog if you have something to say.<span><p></p></span></span></div><div><br></div><div><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-tYRYrpvtp7c/U102i-lj2PI/AAAAAAAADzs/hcQoCdVy37E/s1600/IMG_20140326_140255.jpg" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-tYRYrpvtp7c/U102i-lj2PI/AAAAAAAADzs/hcQoCdVy37E/s1600/IMG_20140326_140255.jpg" height="640" width="640"></a></div><div><span><b><br></b></span></div><div><span><b>How much time do you spend on average on your blog (creating content & promoting it)?</b><span><p></p></span></span></div><div><br></div><div><span>Some days it’s endless hours, others it’s barely any. Depends on what's happening really and how much research and analysis a post needs. Sometimes, I can post from my phone, other times, it takes weeks and months to finalize an article. But, it's safe to say that it's an inseparable part of my life, and I check my WordPress app many times a day to make sure all comments passed through the spam filter (pro tip: don't put too many links in your comments, the anti-spam bots think it's spam) and when the idea becomes clear, I just need a laptop, and it'll be written and published in less than 30 minutes (hence the embarrassing spelling mistakes sometimes).<span><p></p></span></span></div><div><br></div><div><span><b>There has been a debate recently about bloggers' agreement with brands. Do you think that a blogger should completely reveal all the details of such agreements? Why or why not?</b><span><p></p></span></span></div><div><br></div><div><span>Absolutely. I'd advise against it, though, personally. Brands need you, you don't need them, so why sell yourself or bind yourself to their corporate stuff? Keep your distance I'd recommend, and if you decide to embark on such an agreement, make it public, so your "bias" is made clear to the readers who can make their own judgments on your content better. A good example of declaring your bias from the start in what I write, is my very outspoken atheism. When covering religious occasions or issues, the reader has a right to know that I fundamentally disagree with the religions in question, before he or she continues on to read my case against them (or for them), and if they feel the same way about that particular issue (such as civil marriage, women's rights and other unfortunately divisive topics in Lebanon today). <span><p></p></span></span></div><div><br></div><div><span>So, try not to be biased, but if you do decide to cozy up to a brand, make sure you let people know.<span><p></p></span></span></div><div>                                                                                                                                       </div><div><br></div><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MindSoup/~4/iNSFJFeBUdQ" height="1" width="1">";s:17:"post_image_height";i:1520;s:16:"post_image_width";i:1520;s:11:"post_visits";i:36;s:18:"post_twitterShares";i:5;s:19:"post_facebookShares";i:1;s:16:"post_totalShares";i:6;s:16:"post_socialScore";i:50;s:13:"post_virality";i:14;s:9:"blog_name";s:9:"Mind Soup";s:16:"blog_description";s:22:"Blowing your mind away";s:8:"blog_url";s:28:"http://www.mindsoupblog.com/";s:11:"blog_author";s:14:"Mohamed Hijazi";s:28:"blog_author_twitter_username";s:8:"mindsoup";s:13:"blog_rss_feed";s:47:"http://www.mindsoupblog.com/feeds/posts/default";s:9:"blog_tags";s:4:"tech";s:2:"id";i:92;s:11:"blog_active";i:1;s:24:"blog_last_post_timestamp";i:1401104400;}i:12;O:8:"stdClass":26:{s:7:"post_id";i:28543;s:8:"post_url";s:61:"http://mustapha.me/2014/04/shedding-no-tears-for-google-plus/";s:10:"post_title";s:33:"Shedding no Tears for Google Plus";s:10:"post_image";s:61:"http://mustapha.me/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/google_plus.png";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:123:"Surprise surprise, the social media network that google was trying to force down our throats is walking dead with it hea...";s:7:"blog_id";s:8:"mustapha";s:14:"post_timestamp";i:1398586200;s:12:"post_content";s:1883:"<p><img src="http://mustapha.me/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/google_plus.png" alt="Google plus" title="google_plus.png" border="0" width="550" height="333"></p>
<p>Surprise surprise, the social media network that google was trying to force <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2013/01/03/google-plus-is-still-not-a-social-network/">down our throats</a> is <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/04/24/google-is-walking-dead/">walking dead</a> with it head Vic Gundotra now being cut off..</p>
<p>What a relief! I hated that thing so much. Even if it was the best social network in the world, I just don’t like the idea of being forced to use anything. Google has lost so much in my books by doing annoying things like putting google+ notification bells on all my google pages, bells that animate and turn red whenever someone I don’t know decided to add me to his circle. The bells being there by default is not what is annoying, companies have the right to choose defaults; what is really annoying is the fact that I can’t turn them off anywhere. </p>

<p>For over 30 years, rumours circulated that a stockpile of Atari games and gear including the company’s failed E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial game were buried in a New Mexico landfill. Today, those rumours were conformed by a Construction crew that uncovered copies of the Atari 2600 game deep in the New Mexico desert.</p>
<p>The dig was initiated as part of a documentary being produced by Microsoft’s Xbox Entertainment Studios, which will focus on the video game industry. The documentary is expected to come out next year.</p>

<p>According to reports back in the 80s, Atari was struggling and was stuck with huge pile of games and unsold hardware, which the company decided to dump into a landfill.</p>

<p>Atari paid millions to obtain the rights to produce the E.T video game that was based on the successful Steven Spielberg movie, which turned to be a massive failure and was considered as one of the worst game title of all time.</p>
<p>Here’s how bad it was:</p>

At the time, a lot of people speculated that the company might team up with Apple for future products.</p>
<p>In a recent interview on CNBC, Nike’s chief executive officer Mark Parker reignited the speculations by saying that Nike is committed to focusing on software, and is “excited” about the relationship with Apple.</p>
<blockquote><p>“You’re going to continue to see us commit to this area, to focus on expanding the reach. Today we have about 30 million FuelBand users. We’re hoping to push that to over 100 million. We have partners that we work with. Obviously the most visible partner we have is Apple. We’ve been working with them for a long time. And we’re excited about where that relationship will go forward.” Parker said.</p></blockquote>
<p>When CNBC’s Sara Eisen asked if she can get hints about this partnership, Parker replied by saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>“I can’t really say that. There’s been a lot of speculation, which I understand. I will just say the relationship between Nike and Apple will continue. And I am personally — as we all are at Nike — very excited about what’s to come.”</p></blockquote>
<p><span>These speculation are natural given the long history between the two companies.</span></p>

<div>My latest<a title="Middle East Airlines Website" href="http://www.mea.com.lb/" target="_blank"> Middle East Airlines</a> flight from Beirut to London turned out to be much more interesting than expected: The Lebanese airline just released a brand new design for their inflight menu!</div>
<div>You may wonder why a new plane menu would make a flight more exciting. Well, MEA is maybe not the best airline in the world but, it is still my national one and I took many flights with them so I believe it is worth reviewing this nice move they did and adding some suggestions.</div>
<h1></h1>
<h1>Economy Class Menu</h1>
<p><img src="http://expressjr.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/meanewmenueconomy.jpg?w=492&h=586" alt="Mea New Menu Economy English/French" width="492" height="586"></p>
<h2>The Design</h2>
<div>As you can see in the pictures, the economy menu is now more like a newsletter which is quite cool because it offers more value and makes it more modern. <a title="Made For Brands Agency Website" href="http://mfbstudio.com/" target="_blank">Made For Brands</a>, the agency behind the new concept and design, went for a flat design, a modern typography and a good ratio of visual elements and nice simple drawings.</div>
<div>They use red, pale blue and pale green across the pages but, the dominant colour is yellow which is not very consistent with the brand identity that already has three colours: Red, green and blue. Maybe they should replace it with one of those three. Also, the fonts they use are nice but, they use three different ones and the purpose of each is a bit unclear which could make it a bit confusing.<a href="http://expressjr.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/meanewmenueconomyarabic.jpg"><img src="http://expressjr.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/meanewmenueconomyarabic.jpg?w=492&h=618" alt="Mea New Menu Economy Arabic" width="492" height="618"></a></div>
<h2>The Content</h2>
<div>The content is quite interesting and it includes: The food and drinks menu in two versions (An extended and an express one), travel tips, interesting facts, quotes and pictures from the MEA archives. That’s a nice way to offer more value to travellers.</div>
<div>However, the translation annoyed me for some reasons. I find it very weird. The Arabic version and the English/French versions of the menu are quite different! The content of the two versions is completely different except for the menu. Plus, the drinks menu is not available in the arabic version and I don’t know why the English version is entitled “Economy Menu” while the Arabic one is just a “Menu”. I don’t know what’s the logic (or the absence of logic) behind the translation but, I would expect them to offer the exact same content in different languages.</div>
<h1></h1>
<h1>Cedar Class Menu</h1>
<h2><img src="http://expressjr.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/meanewmenubusinessclass.jpg?w=492&h=617" alt="Mea New Menu Business Class" width="492" height="617"></h2>
<h2>The Design</h2>
<div>The business class menu has a more “quite” design which is maybe more adequate to the cedar class customers but, I believe they could add some colours. On this one, they kept the regular menu layout which is not bad and the cover showcases the work of a Lebanese artist called Samir Sayegh. I don’t know if they will change the cover design every now and then and feature other artists. I think it would be nice if they do so. I’m not a big fan of the artwork they chose here for the only reason that it gives a vintage image to this new menu but, that’s of course matter of personal taste.</div>
<h2><a href="http://expressjr.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/meanewmenubusinessclassfood.jpg"><img src="http://expressjr.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/meanewmenubusinessclassfood.jpg?w=492&h=359" alt="Mea New Menu Business Class Food" width="492" height="359"></a></h2>
<h2>The Content</h2>
<div>Here they don’t offer any content in addition to the menu. I do understand that they are not doing a newsletter for the business class as they did for the economy but, maybe adding a nice quote would be appreciated. And here also translation inconsistency: There is a sentence in English about an express meal proposition that’s not translated in Arabic and French.</div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div><a href="http://expressjr.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/meanewmenubusinessclassinside.jpg"><img src="http://expressjr.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/meanewmenubusinessclassinside.jpg?w=492&h=390" alt="Mea New Menu Business Class Inside" width="492" height="390"></a></div>
<h1></h1>
<h1>The Online Platform Promotion</h1>
<div>On both menus they added a section to promote <a title="Middle East Airline Online Platform" href="http://www.mea.com.lb/" target="_blank">the airline’s online platform</a> (see pictures above and below). Similarly to the lack of consistency in the translation of the economy menu, the promotion is different in the two menus: In Economy they only state that you can do online check-in and check timetables while in cedar class they add  that you can also use it for ticketing, online flights (I don’t know what that is by the way), services and check special offers. I think that those additional features are not exclusive to business class customers so why don’t they promote them in the economy menu too?</div>
<div>Now to link to their website, they just added a QR code. The main issue here is not that there are very few people who scan them, it’s the fact that there is no internet connection on MEA flights. Some would argue that there are apps that can scan QR codes from pictures so people can take a picture of it and check it upon arrival: If regular QR scanning is barely happening would you expect people to go further? Also worth noting that no one is going to keep the menu, everyone will leave it on the plane (of course there may be few exceptional cases). If you want to keep the QR code keep it but, at least add a proper URL.</div>
<div>They also added an invitation for feedback about the new design with two Twitter handles (they don’t mention it’s Twitter maybe they should) and two hashtags: One for MEA and one for the design agency. The call for feedback is great but, why two hashtags and two handles? I think they should only keep the MEA hashtag (<a title="#MEAIFS real time results" href="https://twitter.com/search?f=realtime&q=%23meaifs&src=typd" target="_blank">#meaifs</a>) and handle (<a title="Middle East Airlines In Flight Services" href="https://twitter.com/meaifs" target="_blank">@meaifs</a>). The agency can add its handle next to its signature if they want to.</div>

<h1></h1>
<h1>Overview</h1>
<div>All in all, I really liked the new MEA menus! It is true that I had some remarks but this is just feedback and propositions. I hope they will take them in consideration. A very interesting idea by Made For Brands and a great move by Middle East Airlines!</div>
<div></div>
<div>I would also love to hear your thoughts on the new menu so please feel free to comment below.</div>

Well, you should have. OnePlus is a technology startup allegedly committed to bringing the best possible Technology to users around the world. Created around the mantra <strong>Never Settle</strong>, OnePlus is here to create beautifully designed devices with premium build quality.</p>
<p>Well OnePlus announced a few days ago its first ever smartphone: the One. And it’s an Android device.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/~www.gsmarena.com/oneplus_one-6327.php">OnePlus One</a> features the latest Qualcomm Snapdragon 801 (8974AC) platform with a quad-core 2.5GHz Krait 400 CPU, 3GB of LPDDR3 RAM. The display is a 5.5″ full HD JDI-made, resulting in a pixel density of 401ppi.</p>
<p>The original bit comes here: the OnePlus One runs CyanogenMod 11S which is in turn based on Android 4.4 KitKat. The company has worked closely with the ROM team to release a special minimal and flat UI.</p>
<p>As for the build quality and the design, the company chose magnesium for the build of the phone, which brings down the weight of the phone to 162 grams. OnePlus claims this is the lightest 5.5″ smartphone in the world. The One measures 152.9 x 75.9 x 8.9mm with the edges of the phone measure 4.6mm. At the bottom, there are JBL dual stereo speakers.</p>
<p><a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/~tech-ticker.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/OnePlus-One-announcement-09.jpg" rel="gallery-22304"><img src="http://tech-ticker.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/OnePlus-One-announcement-09-500x333.jpg" alt="OnePlus One" width="500" height="333"></a>The OnePlus One features a 13 MP Sony IMX214 Exmor Sensor with 6 Lenses and f/2.0 Aperture, with <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/~www.gsmarena.com/oneplus_one_4k_video_sample_is_out_gets_compared_with_a_dslr-news-8332.php">4K video recording</a> skills. The camera is allegedly capable of quick shutter speed of 0.3 seconds. The back cover of the OnePlus One is removable and the company is also launching special StyleSwap covers similarly to the Moto X. The phone is powered by a 3,100mAh Li-Po battery that isn’t user replaceable.</p>
<p>The OnePlus One will launch in Q2 with Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Italy, Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Taiwan, UK and the USA getting it first. More markets are expected to follow suit soon after. Available in Sandstone Black and Silk White, the unlocked 16GB OnePlus One will retail for $299 (€269 in Europe) and the 64GB model will cost you $350 (€299 in Europe).</p>
<p>To add some more excitement to the launch, OnePlus is currently running a <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/~oneplus.net" target="_blank">special competition</a> whereby participants can win a 16GB Silk White One and get up to three invites to buy the OnePlus One. One objective: smash the phone the participants currently have. Like really smash it.</p>
<p>Three rules:</p>
<p><b>1.</b> Apply – Fill out the application form and send it in.</p>
<p><b>2.</b> Stand Out – We’ll choose 100 applicants to be our smashers.</p>

<p>No obvious reason was stated.</p>
<p>But online leaks pointed out that this might have been the direct result of Google backing away from the original Google+ plan.</p>
<p>To wrap it up in a nutshell, Google is apparently slowly planning on pulling the Google+ plug: it will no longer be aligned to Facebook and Twitter. It will also not be pushed onto and into every product Google releases. This rumored shift will most probably shake the Google boat: around 1000 employees will hence be moved to other divisions with Google Hangouts and Google+ Photos teams supposedly moved to Android.</p>
<p>Moving away from the rumors, it kind of makes sense for Google to back away from Google+. It simply did not gain any momentum at all. Its actual userbase is far from being called “massive” (it definitely cannot rival Facebook in that respect), and most importantly, the people simply… don’t like it.</p>
<p>It remains unclear if the leaked reports are true. The future of Google+ remains unknown too. But the departure of Gundotra certainly is a pretty powerful hint.</p>
<p>And what comes out of this piece of information is mainly one thing: Google is placing more and more chips on the Android betting case. And that makes sense.</p>

<p>Reporting to Nadella is former Nokia President and CEO Stephen Elop, who will serve as executive vice president of the Microsoft Devices Group, overseeing an expanded devices business that includes Lumia smartphones and tablets, Nokia mobile phones, Xbox hardware, Surface, Perceptive Pixel (PPI) products and accessories. Microsoft welcomes personnel with deep industry experience in more than 130 sites across 50 countries worldwide, including several factories that design, develop, manufacture, market and sell a broad portfolio of innovative smart devices, mobile phones and services. As part of the transaction, Microsoft will honor all existing Nokia customer warranties for existing devices.</p>
<p>Windows Phone is the fastest-growing ecosystem in the smartphone market, and its portfolio of award-winning devices continues to expand. In the fourth quarter of 2013, according to IDC, Windows Phone reinforced its position as a top three smartphone operating system and was the fastest-growing platform among the leading operating systems with 91 percent year-over-year gain. Furthermore, with the Nokia mobile phone business, Microsoft will target the affordable mobile devices market, a $50 billion annual opportunity, delivering the first mobile experience to the next billion people while introducing Microsoft services to new customers around the world.</p>
<p>Microsoft will continue to deliver new value and opportunity, and it will work closely with a range of hardware partners, developers, operators, distributors and retailers, providing platforms, tools, applications and services that enable them to make exceptional devices. With a deeper understanding of hardware and software working as one, the company will strengthen and grow demand for Windows devices overall.</p>

<p>Nokia Corporation<br>Stock exchange release<br>April 25, 2014 at 13.55 (CET +1)</p>
<p>Espoo, Finland – Nokia today announced that it has completed the sale of substantially all of its Devices & Services business to Microsoft.</p>
<p>The transaction, which also includes an agreement to license patents to Microsoft, was originally announced on September 3, 2013.</p>
<p>As earlier communicated, the transaction was subject to potential purchase price adjustments. The estimate of the adjustments made for net working capital and cash earnings was slightly positive for Nokia, and we currently expect the total transaction price to be slightly higher than the earlier-announced transaction price of EUR 5.44 billion after the final adjustments are made based on the verified closing balance sheet.</p>
<p>Additionally, as is customary for transactions of this size, scale and complexity, Nokia and Microsoft made certain adjustments to the scope of the assets originally planned to transfer. These adjustments included Nokia’s manufacturing facilities in Chennai in India and Masan in the Republic of Korea not transferring to Microsoft. These adjustments have no impact on the material deal terms of the transaction and Nokia will be materially compensated for any retained liabilities.</p>
<p>In India, our manufacturing facility is subject to an asset freeze by the Indian tax authorities as a result of ongoing tax proceedings. Consequently, the facility remains part of Nokia following the closing of the transaction. Nokia and Microsoft have entered into a service agreement whereby Nokia would produce mobile devices for Microsoft.</p>
<p>In Korea, Nokia and Microsoft agreed to exclude the Masan facility from the scope of the transaction. Nokia will now take steps to close the facility, which employs approximately 200 people.</p>
<p>Amid the uncertainty for our employees in Chennai and because of the planned closure of our facility in Masan, Nokia plans to offer a program of support, including financial assistance which would give our employees the chance to explore opportunities outside Nokia starting from a sound financial base. The company plans to bring to Chennai and Masan elements of its Bridge program, which we have made available for employees affected by company changes in other sites.</p>
<p>The convertible bonds issued by Nokia to Microsoft following the announcement of the transaction have been redeemed and netted against the deal proceeds by the amount of principal and accrued interest.</p>
<p>As previously announced, the following Nokia leaders have stepped down from the Nokia Leadership Team and transferred to Microsoft at closing, effective April 25, 2014: Stephen Elop, Jo Harlow, Juha Putkiranta, Timo Toikkanen, and Chris Weber. Until further notice, Nokia’s interim governance model announced on September 3, 2013 is in place.</p>
<p>Nokia plans to cover in further detail aspects of the closing of the transaction in conjunction with its first quarter 2014 results announcement on April 29, 2014.</p>
<p>Now that the closing of this transaction has taken place, Nokia is arranging a Board of Directors meeting for early next week in relation to its strategy assessment which was originally disclosed on September 3, 2013.</p>
