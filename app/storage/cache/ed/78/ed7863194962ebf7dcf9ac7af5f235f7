<p><strong><span>Home. Family. Future. Yup, looks like Caesar and co. have taken over the Lebanese box office. <em><span><a href="http://ageeksblog.com/2014/07/11/movie-review-dawn-of-the-planet-of-the-apes-2014/">Dawn of the Planet of the Apes</a></span></em> took the first spot this weekend with 9,407 admissions. While not a spectacular opening (it trails other summer movie openings like <em>Spider-Man, </em><em>Godzilla, Maleficent, and X-Men</em>), it’s important to keep in mind that the world cup final likely kept a decent chunk of viewers away. Also, the <em>Planet of the Apes</em> franchise doesn’t have huge name recognition in the Middle East, and Andy Serkis isn’t a household name with the general moviegoing audience. Still, great word of mouth should make this a popular choice for weeks to come.</span></strong></p>
<p><span>After three weeks on top, <em><span><a href="https://ageeksblog.com/2014/06/11/movie-review-22-jump-street-2014/">22 Jump Street</a></span></em> finally got dethroned. The film scored an additional 4,932 admissions, raising its total to an excellent 38,182 tickets sold in four weeks. <em><span><a href="https://ageeksblog.com/2014/06/02/movie-review-maleficent-2014/">Maleficent</a></span>,</em> which is showing no signs of slowing down, literally dropped by 1% from last weekend, adding 3,853 admissions for an insane total of 80,555. At this rate, there’s no telling how high these numbers can go.</span></p>
<p><span><em>Qu’est ce Qu’on A Fait Au Bon Dieu?</em> actually climbed two spots and landed in fourth place. It’s also showing incredible legs; it dropped by less than 0.3 percent from last weekend’s numbers. <em><span><a href="https://ageeksblog.com/2014/06/23/movie-review-think-like-a-man-too-2014/">Think Like a Man Too</a></span></em> landed in the fifth spot with 2,407 admissions, for a new sum of 12,867 admissions after three weeks.</span></p>
<p><span>Other notable figures include the new release <em><span><a href="http://tlkabtmovies.com/2014/07/15/cold-in-july-2014/">Cold in July</a></span></em>, which rounded out the top ten with 442 admissions from seven theaters, and <em>Avis De Mistral</em>, which opened in the eleventh spot with 344 admissions from only three theaters. </span></p>

Argentina had better c...";s:7:"blog_id";s:6:"figo29";s:14:"post_timestamp";i:1405518720;s:12:"post_content";s:5686:"<p>The World Cup Final between Argentina and Germany is now another game that will haunt me forever.</p>
<p>Argentina had better chances – or actually gifts from the German defenders – to score, but it was exactly what Gary Lineker said one day: “Football is a simple game. Twenty-two men chase a ball for 90 minutes and at the end, the Germans always win.”</p>
<p>Looking back at how Argentina performed throughout the tournament, it was a joy for the eye.</p>
<p>Well, if you were expecting the best forward players in the world to score 10 goals a game, then you were surely disappointed. Argentina played beautiful defence, whether you liked it or not. Before Sabella existed, Argentina never knew how to defend. Sabella did the best thing to ensure this squad makes it to the semi-finals – at least – for the first time in 24 years. He created a defensive system that I haven’t seen anything like it when it comes to the Argentina National Team. He knew his team’s weaknesses and worked hard to turn them into strength. Sabella succeeded in doing so, and showed extraordinary skills crafting the system he played with during the tournament.</p>
<p>However, while paying extra attention to the defence – which, again, was the only way to make it to the semi-finals – Sabella undermined the super attack he had and disengaged the midfield from the front line. He only depended on Messi to do what Messi wanted to do. Messi in return, scored half the team’s goals and created many others. He sacrificed himself for the team and always had 2 or 3 defenders from the opposition trying to take him down. He did not sit in the attack and waited for balls that will never reach him but rather sat deep in the second third of the pitch and created something out of nothing. He may have disappeared in the semi-final match, and in the second half of the final match, too, but he was instrumental why Argentina reached a World Cup Final for the first time in 24 years.</p>
<p><a href="https://figo29.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/messi-score-bosnia-world-cup-final.jpg"><img src="http://figo29.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/messi-score-bosnia-world-cup-final.jpg?w=300&h=191" alt="Brazil Soccer WCup Argentina Bosnia" width="300" height="191"></a></p>
<p>The “disappearance” of Messi resulted in anger by the fans when he was handed the tournament’s best player. I was the first to slaughter Messi and refute the choice, but I was wrong to an extent. I forgot the golden rule that humans should not make statements or take action when under any kind of extreme emotional influence.</p>
<p>To be fair with Messi we should list the following:</p>
<ul><li>Messi was over pressurized by media, fans, and everyone to win the World Cup on his own. He was asked to be a god.</li>
<li>Comparisons with Maradona were the only thing he ever heard; to the extent he forgot his own name.</li>
<li>Muscular burnout and fatigue were obvious to the eye but we decided to overlook them. He was vomiting all over the pitch, in the Final, while we were criticizing him.</li>
<li>Without Messi’s goals, Argentina would have earned only 2 points in the Group Stage and left the competition early. That’s how Argentina is weak, even though the opponents were mediocre teams at that stage.</li>
<li>Messi was given the role of the leader and he only accepted it so as not to be faced with treason. He never led a squad by his spirit or presence and always depended on his performance and goals to gain popularity.</li>
<li>Aguero, Higuain, and some others did not play well, but were not criticized as heavily as was Messi.</li>
<li>Sabella chose Gago to sit in the playmaker role, and both failed miserably, while Pastore and some other names could have done a better and much needed job.</li>
<li>Lavezzi played a great first half against Germany, but it will remain unknown why he was subbed off at halftime.</li>
</ul><p>Messi was made the scapegoat when Argentina failed to win the Final. Fact is: If Argentina won, no one would even care about the physical and mental state of Messi.</p>
<p><a href="https://figo29.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/lionel-messi-after-the-world-cup-final-loss-to-germany.jpg"><img src="http://figo29.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/lionel-messi-after-the-world-cup-final-loss-to-germany.jpg?w=300&h=205" alt="lionel messi after the world cup final loss to germany" width="300" height="205"></a></p>
<p>I am disappointed that Argentina did not win, and sort of confused if I should celebrate the best tournament achievement in 24 years or retreat in tears.</p>
<p>But what I am sure of is that I am worried about Messi. Is Messi’s body failing him? Is he mentally obsessed with stuff we do not know? Is he stuffed with titles and trophies that he doesn’t have anything to play for anymore? Did he lose passion for the ball? He needs to be checked by a psychologist, physiotherapist, and every possible doctor alive.</p>
<p>Between 2008 and 2014, Messi gave us some mesmerizing football. We should be thankful for that. For the better of the game, and for our own benefit, let us hope that he gives us at least four more years of extraordinary displays and plenty of goals.</p><br>Filed under: <a href="http://figo29.com/category/argentina/">Argentina</a>, <a href="http://figo29.com/category/world-cup/">World Cup</a>  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/figo29.wordpress.com/2919/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/figo29.wordpress.com/2919/"></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=figo29.com&blog=15189048&post=2919&subd=figo29&ref=&feed=1" width="1" height="1">";s:17:"post_image_height";i:395;s:16:"post_image_width";i:620;s:11:"post_visits";i:11;s:18:"post_twitterShares";i:4;s:19:"post_facebookShares";i:52;s:16:"post_totalShares";i:56;s:16:"post_socialScore";i:27;s:13:"post_virality";i:32;s:9:"blog_name";s:13:"Figo29's Blog";s:16:"blog_description";s:19:"For football and me";s:8:"blog_url";s:18:"http://figo29.com/";s:11:"blog_author";s:4:"figo";s:28:"blog_author_twitter_username";s:6:"figo29";s:13:"blog_rss_feed";s:23:"http://figo29.com/feed/";s:9:"blog_tags";s:6:"sports";s:2:"id";i:38;s:11:"blog_active";i:1;s:24:"blog_last_post_timestamp";i:1405518720;s:6:"col_id";N;s:8:"col_name";N;s:16:"col_media_source";N;s:13:"col_home_page";N;s:13:"col_shorthand";N;s:26:"col_media_source_shorthand";N;s:27:"col_author_twitter_username";N;s:8:"col_tags";N;s:15:"col_description";N;s:23:"col_last_post_timestamp";N;}i:3;O:8:"stdClass":36:{s:7:"post_id";i:32825;s:8:"post_url";s:43:"http://blogbaladi.com/new-chiclets-designs/";s:10:"post_title";s:20:"New Chiclets Designs";s:10:"post_image";s:61:"http://blogbaladi.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/chiclets.jpg";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:28:"I still prefer the old ones.";s:7:"blog_id";s:10:"blogbaladi";s:14:"post_timestamp";i:1405517100;s:12:"post_content";s:157:"<p><img src="http://blogbaladi.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/chiclets.jpg" alt="chiclets" width="600" height="761"></p>

The artist, whose real name is Thierry Guetta, was a little known figure who popped up in the street art world after his appearance in the 2010 film, Exit Through the Gift Shop. Since then, he has become as prolific and well-known as he has controversial.  Some critics have even claimed he's a hoax conceived by the famously anonymous British graffiti artist, Banksy, in a real-life critique on the vapid artificiality of the art world. 
  
  Indeed, the style of his work would seem an amateur reproduction of Banksy's original street style archetype. And despite the fact that his work has been completed by a team of graphic designers since 2008, Mr. Brainwash's pieces continue to be sold at five and six figure sums. Herein lies the irony: an exhibit called "Life is Beautiful," mocks the mass production of art that our gullible culture readily eats up. Beirut, too, is a charade; the so-called "Paris of the Middle East," an arguably poor imitation for what a real cosmopolitan city should be. 
  
  
  
  Using pop culture imagery, neon colors and iconic figures, Mr. Brainwash's "Life is Beautiful" exhibit, now on display at Gallery 169 in Saifi Village, introduces small alterations to famous images in ways that are meant to evoke a change in perception for the viewer. One particular work shows an Edgar Degas’ painting of ballerinas masked with Charlie Chaplin doing pirouettes. There’s also a General Gaddhafi with Marilyn Monroe-platinum hair and makeup, and a Jackson Pollock painting with Mickey Mouse on top.  It should be noted that much of Mr. Brainwash's work is copyrighted, but the Brainwash experience is less about the artistic effort behind the work than the ideas he intends to orchestrate. 
  
  Alongside the "Life is Beautiful" installation is Patrick Rubenstein’s kinetic art installation. Unlike Mr. Brainwash's work, Rubeinstein’s installation is more of a visual feast, with stunning attention to detail, and offering the baffling realization that even the smallest piece looks as though it took an incredible amount of effort and time to make. Rubenstein’s obsession with argentic photos (which contain silver) and kinetic art works, which depend on movement for effect, compelled him to mix both mediums into a novel form of art that has the effect of changing in form as you walk past it. 
  
  
  
  
  Reminiscent of street billboards, his work is made up of triangular strips, with each side of the strip exposing just a piece of the picture. So as you walk past a Mona Lisa painting, for instance, Mona Lisa slowly starts morphing into something else entirely. It’s truly a remarkable interaction between art and the motions of the viewer, and you're strongly advised to check it out.
  
  Both artists - Brainwash and Rubenstein - are part of the Bel-Air Fine Art group, an international art group based in Geneva and run by Francois Chabanian, a mild mannered, multi-lingual art mogul who has seven galleries spread across Europe and more than 30 artists under his belt. Their works are paraded across the world, from Shanghai to New York. Mr. Chabanian visited Lebanon in 2010 and came away from the trip believing the untapped Middle East market is full of potential for art lovers who are not usually given the chance to experience firsthand the works of international artists. Well, that is no longer the case, thanks to his efforts. The works of these prominent artists are available for you to see in person and even buy, if you are obscenely wealthy.
  
  Two artists, students of pop art, obsessed with icons and expressing their admiration for them in very different ways. The exhibition ends this Saturday, July 19.

<p><strong>Israel warned some 100,000 Palestinians to evacuate their homes this morning ahead of a major aggression that is set to commence by 0500 GMT. </strong></p>
<p>But the question to be asked is, evacuate to where??? The Gaza Strip is the most <a href="http://lbcblogs.com/?feed-stats-url=aHR0cDovL3d3dy51bnJ3YS5vcmcvd2hlcmUtd2Utd29yay9nYXphLXN0cmlw" title='\"densely' populated target='\"_blank\"'>densely populated</a> region on the face of this planet.

<p><strong>And as Jon Stewart so eloquently puts it, “what are the people supposed to do? Swim for it?” </strong></p>
<p>But even that they can’t do! Israel has been imposing a maritime embargo on the narrow coastal enclave since 2007. The Rafah border crossing on the southern edge is sealed by Egypt and the remaining borders are blocked by the Israeli army.<br></p>

<p><strong>How is it that the world has lost so much of its sight, compassion and ability to see the tragedies that are befalling Palestinian civilians? Worse off, how is the media portraying the two sides as equals? Watch the video, because it comes out so much better when a Jew says it. </strong></p>

<p><strong>Then we have this kid; this brave, gentle, young activist who made it all the way from the United States to stand up for the Palestinians, only to be bullied by the Israeli police. </strong></p>
<p>This brave, young Jewish man stood alone in the middle of the street wearing a Palestinian kuffiyeh around his neck and a Jewish kippah on his head voicing his discontent with the occupation of Palestinian land by Israeli settlers. </p>

<p><strong>I read somewhere on the internet a couple of days ago a quote allegedly said by a Gazan that read something like this: </strong></p>
<p>“If I die tonight, take whatever good organs are left in my body and donate them to those in need, but my middle finger? Give that to the Arabs.”</p>
<p>I couldn’t agree more. </p>

<p><strong>Let us just hold prayer to those trapped in the prison that is Gaza, but also let us spread the word on the atrocities befalling the strip and those who are continually marginalized by mainstream media, those who are protesting the offensive dubbed by Israeli authorities “Operation Protective Edge”…the irony.</strong>  </p>

I know I have been a very bad blogger lately with my lack of posts for almost 10 days. I have been very busy lately, and I hate to blog just for the sake of blogging without pouring my heart into every word I say.<br>I consider myself lucky to have a platform where I can share to the world all my thoughts and my inspiration and that's why I am sharing this post today.<br>Last Saturday marked a new milestone, it was my university graduation ceremony! I wish I had enough words to describe all the feelings and emotions that accompanied me throughout this day, but I can say that it felt so good to be graduating with my friends with honors after 3 tiring years. Many people helped me throughout those 3 years, and some were there to help even after I finished my last final, you all know yourselves and I thank you from all my heart!<br>As this chapter of my life ended, I gained some new perspectives on life, I became somewhat fearless craving adventure and excitement more than ever before. My goal now is to discover new emotions, new people, new counties, and find more inspirations and passions. Many people are asking me if I am thinking of pursuing my masters degree now but actually I would love to test out the market out there and find a field that I am passionate about that might help me in choosing a masters pathway to eventually build a career on that. I might even choose to relocate to a different country, nothing is known at that point and I am perfectly happy with that!

</p><p><b><span></span>Santorini – Sunlight and Beach Blue </b></p>
<p>Considered as one of the world’s most charming islands, Santorini is very well known for its perfect beach weather and picturesque setting. The azure sea, the white-and-blue houses – it looks like something that came out of a storybook. For all my active brides who love watching a romantic sunset just as much as they love snorkeling, diving, rock climbing, or even hitting the quaint streets and exploring the nightlife, Santorini should be on your list!</p>
<p>
</p><p><b>Capri – Italy’s Finest</b></p>
<p>The stunning island of Capri is next on our list. Capri is known for having a lot of gorgeous touristic spots, cozy cafes, and good seafood, but if you’re up for some real sightseeing, you need to check out its famous Blue Grotto. The grotto is a gorgeous natural cavern on the coast that glows in the sea’s pure aqua color – a sight that really gets you in awe at the power of nature.</p>
<p>
</p><p><b>Istanbul – A Cultural Journey </b></p>
<p>Being  a versatile and diverse country that puts together the East and the West, Turkey should definitely be on your honeymoon bucket list. In Istanbul, You’ll find it very familiar whether it comes to the tradition, food, or language, but with its own little twists. Let’s not forget about its famous touristic spots and go-to monuments such as Aya Sophia and The Blue Mosque – you’ll definitely be doing a lot of sightseeing with your partner, examining the beautiful details of the locations and immersing yourselves in a cultural experience.</p>
<p>

But at least this hour restored a sense of fun to the proceedings, while sustaining the show's signature wit. There's a long way to go before <i>True Blood</i> can reclaim its luster (it probably won't though I'd love to be proven otherwise), but this was the season's first <b>truly</b> effective hour.</div><div><br></div><div>Simply put, I attribute this episode's success to the epic flashbacks featuring Pam and Eric. It was fantastic to see the beginnings of Fangtasia (an adult video store no less), and the defining moment of Eric becoming Sheriff. The fact that the writers managed to tie the bar's history to Ginger was just icing on the cake. It's subplots such as this one that supply the show with a sense of gravitas and weight after seven seasons worth of storytelling. However....</div><div><br></div><div>Why are we still wasting time on sequences as pointless as Jason and Sam visiting Kevin's wife Rosie? And if you don't know who the latter two are, I don't blame you because they're enormously superfluous characters. It boggles my mind that <i>True Blood</i>'s writing staff is still so oblivious to the screen-time they waste on useless characters and subplots. I guess some things will never change and I need to make peace with that. </div><div><br></div><div><span><b>Bloody Bits</b></span></div><div><br></div><div>- Jason calling Hoyt and telling him about his momma was kind of touching I guess.</div><div><br></div><div>- Laugh-out loud moment: the Magister throwing the keys at Pam who blankly stares at him instead of catching them.</div><div><br></div><div>- The green screen effect with Sam and Jason driving was shockingly horrendous. <b>Really</b> HBO? You can't afford something that looks marginally believable?</div><div><br></div><div>- Sookie getting through to Jessica with her speech was probably one of the character's better moments. She still sucks as a protagonist. </div><div><br></div><div>- I can't get over the fact that Ginger came up with the idea for Fangtasia. Her entire pitch with Eric on the throne was beyond priceless and awesome. Naturally, Pam stole her idea. </div><div><br></div><div>- Hilariously sad sight with Eric struggling to punch through the wall. </div><div><br></div><div>- Fascinating moment with Pam telling Bill that it will <b>never</b> work out for him and Sookie. </div><div><br></div><div>- The fight sequence wasn't bad huh? Could have been longer though. </div><div><br></div><div>- Badass moment: Jason blowing the vamp to bits and saving Sookie. </div><div><br></div><div>- As if I needed further proof that Carrie Preston was a exceptional actress, she went on ahead and delivered that brilliant hallucination scene as she reconnected with Terry before almost-dying. <u>Wow</u>. </div><div><br></div><div><span><b>True Quips</b></span></div><div><br></div><div>Jackson: He loved the fuck out of you Sookie.</div><div><br></div><div>Pam: (about Sookie) She's like a fucking fungus that just won't go away.</div><div><br></div><div>Ginger: Eric Northman is nothing if he is not pure fucking sex on a throne.</div><div><br></div><div>Sookie: (as Bill feeds on her) It’s just lunch.</div><div><br></div><div>Pam: Ginger, look at yourself and look at me. Who has better taste?</div><div><br></div><div><span><b>Conclusion</b></span></div><div>Although it has its flaws, <b>Death Is Not The End</b> is the strongest episode of the season thus far.</div><div><br></div><div><b><span>Nad Rating</span></b></div><div><b><span><span>B+</span></span></b></div><div><br></div></div></div>";s:17:"post_image_height";i:1066;s:16:"post_image_width";i:1600;s:11:"post_visits";i:1;s:18:"post_twitterShares";i:1;s:19:"post_facebookShares";i:3;s:16:"post_totalShares";i:4;s:16:"post_socialScore";i:7;s:13:"post_virality";i:11;s:9:"blog_name";s:13:"Nad's Reviews";s:16:"blog_description";s:72:"Nad's Reviews specializes in TV reviews as well as films and restaurants";s:8:"blog_url";s:27:"http://www.nadsreviews.com/";s:11:"blog_author";s:3:"Nad";s:28:"blog_author_twitter_username";s:11:"NadsReviews";s:13:"blog_rss_feed";s:54:"http://www.nadsreviews.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss";s:9:"blog_tags";s:18:"tv, culture, media";s:2:"id";i:162;s:11:"blog_active";i:1;s:24:"blog_last_post_timestamp";i:1405593540;s:6:"col_id";N;s:8:"col_name";N;s:16:"col_media_source";N;s:13:"col_home_page";N;s:13:"col_shorthand";N;s:26:"col_media_source_shorthand";N;s:27:"col_author_twitter_username";N;s:8:"col_tags";N;s:15:"col_description";N;s:23:"col_last_post_timestamp";N;}i:12;O:8:"stdClass":36:{s:7:"post_id";i:32816;s:8:"post_url";s:77:"http://www.nadsreviews.com/2014/07/devious-maids-2x13-look-back-in-anger.html";s:10:"post_title";s:39:"Devious Maids 2x13 - Look Back In Anger";s:10:"post_image";s:108:"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-GJNf04oi1X0/U8Y__IJ3DDI/AAAAAAAAK6I/MidicR8PSsE/s1600/dm2_213_05302014_bm_0071.jpg";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:123:"Don't forget to follow Nad's Reviews on Facebook and Twitter for the latest updates.

The neighbors will be thrilled."</span></i></div><div><br></div><div>The reason I watch <i>Devious Maids </i>is simple: it reminds me of <a href="http://www.nadsreviews.com/search/label/Desperate%20Housewives">Desperate Housewives.</a> It's nowhere near as finely-crafted, nuanced or affecting, but it's a diverting slice of entertainment that hits the spot when you're in need of some brainless fun. While the show started out on the <a href="http://www.nadsreviews.com/2013/07/devious-maids-1x01-pilot.html">wrong foot</a>, it soon evolved into something <a href="http://www.nadsreviews.com/2013/09/devious-maids-1x13-totally-clean.html">pretty enjoyable</a>, and thankfully this finale kept that streak going. </div><div><br></div><div>The finale's biggest and most intriguing development was the reveal that Nick was in fact responsible for the death of Adrian and Evelyn's son. It's a twist that actually surprised me for once, and it allowed the writers to take our characters into some dark and compelling places. It's no secret that Rebecca Wisocky and Tom Irwin are two of the show's strongest performers, and they did wonders in that climactic and powerful scene that felt like it was two seasons in the making. Although I have no idea if Nick will continue to be part of the show, I'm excited to see the Powells forge a much stronger and deeper bond now that the truth is out in the open. </div><div><br></div><div>Less successful was this year's season-long arc with the gang of thugs shooting up Beverly Hills. I'm just not a fan of young actors taking up space, particularly when they're not so blessed in the acting department. However, Ty's final attack at least gave us a heck of a cliffhanger with a brutal shooting (and a bouquet of bloody roses). Here's hoping the show takes a risk and kills off a bunch of characters by the time the season three premiere comes knocking.</div><div><br></div><div><span><b>Bits from Beverly Hills</b></span></div><div><br></div><div>- I want to say I care about Spencer marrying Rosie but these two do absolutely nothing for me. Still, it was at least hilarious to watch Rosie fire Carmen, although I think the writers missed a huge opportunity here by not making Rosie her friend's boss next year. That could have been a comedy <b>goldmine</b>.</div><div><br></div><div>- Did the Powell flashback remind anyone else of <i>Desperate Housewives</i>? It felt so very Mary Alice, particularly with the creepy ethereal musical cues.</div><div><br></div><div>- Well Pablo sure is greedy with his kidneys. What will Genevieve do now? The writers better not even consider the possibility of killing off Susan Lucci. She's the show's MVP as far as I'm concerned.</div><div><br></div><div>- I like Javier, and I was really glad to see Zoila return to to him at the end. Sadly, the latter is pretty unlikeable 90 percent of the time. Echoes of Lynette Scavo here. </div><div><br></div><div>- Carmen telling the guy on the phone that he has a thick accent made me laugh. This woman genuinely feels like the heir to Eva Longoria. </div><div><br></div><div>- I think the character of Sebastian might be good for the show; Gilles Marini has an easy chemistry with Roselyn Sanchez, and I enjoyed the twist of his wife being the talent agent. </div><div><br></div><div>- What ever happened with Didi and Lucinda? That kind of fizzled out huh? I enjoyed those two immensely this year. </div><div><br></div><div>- Does Valentina's New York internship mean she'll be leaving the show for good? A guy can pray can't he?</div><div><br></div><div>- So Rosie's first husband is still alive. How predictable. </div><div><br></div><div>- Zoila's pregnant? Really? Must we suffer through a cliche who's-the-father storyline? I expect more from Marc Cherry and Eva Longoria. </div><div><br></div><div><span><b>Devious Digs</b></span></div><div><br></div><div>Zoila: Marriage is exciting inst it?</div><div>Marisol: Yeah it is.

<p>After memos banning public eating and a string of religiously fueled suicide bombings, coupled with scathing criticism and absurd allegations towards Lebanese nightlife and beach parties, the putrid hand of religious intolerance strikes again, and this time on an iconic piece of graff in Verdun.</p>
<p>It’s actually kind of funny, given that the person who did this, probably looks like the last stage of that evolution (complete with gun and explosive vest). It’s sad that many Lebanese folks still lack the most basic education when it comes to human biology and evolution. I blame religious schools for omitting it from their curricula, producing specimens like the one that vandalized this mural.</p>
<p>Let’s hope the dumbass that did this doesn’t evolve into a suicide bomber…</p>

Of course this doesn’t reflect dominant public opinion in the West that still is apologetic of Israel’s actions. Not one official state declaration has condemned the Israeli attacks. If anything, the few who bothered to issue a statement reiterated Israel’s right to defend itself as it was perceived to live under a constant threat of rocket shower. <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2014/07/world-reacts-conflict-gaza-201471073217736666.html" target="_blank">Check here</a> if you want to have goose bumps.</p>
<p>But there is one place where no demonstrations are in sight: the Arab world. Also, not one condemnation was issued by any Arab government, not one declaration. It is taken for granted that no Western government has condoned Israeli attacks either. But how can we explain this apathy sweeping the Arab region? Surely, they have their own problems all linked to one or other form of occupation. But this conflict used to be called the Israeli-Arab conflict for crying out loud!</p>
<p>A couple of centuries ago, the situation in the region looked very similar: the crusaders were well entrenched on the coast of the “fertile crescent”, and the rest of the Muslim world was completely paralyzed, accepting, if not complicit, in the status quo of occupation until Nur ad-din and his successor Saladin challenged the paradigm. This is at least what the history books say. Some of this dominant cultural apathy or nonchalance, the surrender and normalization, must have existed so that these two individuals and the movements they represented have gone down in the books as changing the face of history.</p>
<p>Modern Arabs have not used their historical consciousness as an agent of ideological change or political action. The basic nationalistic experiments that were fashioned by colonial encounters left Arabs struggling over questions of terminology and then categorizing history in one way or another. Devising points of reference and of origin. The crusades episode was barely glossed over (until now the only book that presents an interesting take on that episode is Amin Maalouf’s. That tells you about the state of the literature).</p>
<p>On one hand, Arab leftist movements were too busy looking towards a brighter socially more “evolved” future and being ashamed of their Islamic heritage, helplessly wanting to teach social and political “progress” of the West. On the other hand, nationalist movements were quarreling amongst each other finding all kinds of identitarian anchors to justify their causes (the Omayyad period was a favorite as it looked the most “secular”, but also anything pre-Islamic).</p>
<p>No one thought of approaching history as giving lessons for political practice. More recently but still a couple of centuries ago, the “Renaissance” Italian writer Machiavelli looked at the history of the Roman Empire in this particular vein as he hoped to provide advice to unite the various Princedoms feuding over Italy. Interestingly, Machiavelli was categorized as ushering a new era of thinking politics outside the scope of religion, a state that had lasted since the advent of Catholic Christianity in Europe.</p>
<p>In modern times, we have fallen in to the trap of categorizing Machiavelli a secular thinker as opposed to one that was just opposed to dominant categories of analysis that happened to be held at the time by the Catholic Church with its particular understanding of history. The point of thinkers such as Machiavelli was to say that the Catholic Church could not provide the needed leverage to create political unity. Ideologically speaking, there was a need to produce new categories of thinking. Machiavelli called for a new political science, one that does away with traditional categories of analysis, not because they were bad or “backward”, but because the institutions backing them did not have anymore the means to create new political realities.</p>
<p>All this is to say that Arabs have been obsessed with categorizing things as either secular or religious as intellectuals of all creeds desperately clung on to the categories of colonial heritage. How could they have done otherwise? The colonizer had also captured their texts and by this token had controlled the creation of knowledge emanating from these writings! The primary victim of this reversed Orientalism espoused by Arabs was historical consciousness. The past became a cumbersome process that was only used to create identities, differences and reactionary discourse and not be a repository for good action.</p>
<p>The rise of Political Islam was a direct reaction to this awkward and clumsy attitude towards history. Suddenly the past was all important. But what kind of past? For example, during the Lebanese “civil war”, the crusader episode was visited in history by various Muslim groups but only to identify them to the contemporary Lebanese Christians who they were fighting between 1975 and 1990. Even though one could retrieve lessons in political practice from these uses of the past they were also creating group differentiation (here Christian VS Muslims).</p>
<p>And every time history was revised it was to create identitarian differences. Such as fomenting trouble between Sunni and Shia denominated groups. Books and articles, talk-shows and documentaries, all proliferate on relentless questions and searches of authenticity, developing either an alleged Sunni or Shia take on the Islamic tradition. No wonder we’ve been busied away from other conflicts.</p>
<p>As I looked for what was written on Nur ad-din, most of what I found was how much he was a great Sunni leader who opposed Shia Fatimid Egypt of the time. In effect, this is not incorrect. But that’s not what the prevailing historians of the time want us to remember, at least in the aftermath of the defeat against the crusaders. The point here is not that the “right” conflict is looking for the right identity to conflict with. The point is to look at the location of forms of occupation, oppression, unjust violence, etc. and understand how to remedy that through the legacy of others who did before us. How can one create the necessary form of consciousness through learning from the past in order to produce community change?</p>
<p>With technological revolutions and every single group or individual having a media channel of his own this ideological rallying is an immense challenge. It is ironic that Arabs are said to be closer to democracy or accountability given that they don’t even pressure their government to do something about Palestine. Is this a sign of apathy, a change of heart, or just a failure to understand and return the debt to the past?</p><br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/remarkz.wordpress.com/4826/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/remarkz.wordpress.com/4826/"></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=remarkz.wordpress.com&blog=3584669&post=4826&subd=remarkz&ref=&feed=1" width="1" height="1">";s:17:"post_image_height";i:0;s:16:"post_image_width";i:0;s:11:"post_visits";i:0;s:18:"post_twitterShares";i:0;s:19:"post_facebookShares";i:0;s:16:"post_totalShares";i:0;s:16:"post_socialScore";i:1;s:13:"post_virality";i:2;s:9:"blog_name";s:7:"Remarkz";s:16:"blog_description";s:62:"Footnotes on what came to be called the Middle East and beyond";s:8:"blog_url";s:28:"http://remarkz.wordpress.com";s:11:"blog_author";s:7:"Remarkz";s:28:"blog_author_twitter_username";N;s:13:"blog_rss_feed";s:34:"http://remarkz.wordpress.com/feed/";s:9:"blog_tags";s:8:"politics";s:2:"id";i:119;s:11:"blog_active";i:1;s:24:"blog_last_post_timestamp";i:1405677120;s:6:"col_id";N;s:8:"col_name";N;s:16:"col_media_source";N;s:13:"col_home_page";N;s:13:"col_shorthand";N;s:26:"col_media_source_shorthand";N;s:27:"col_author_twitter_username";N;s:8:"col_tags";N;s:15:"col_description";N;s:23:"col_last_post_timestamp";N;}i:16;O:8:"stdClass":36:{s:7:"post_id";i:32813;s:8:"post_url";s:79:"http://blogbaladi.com/stop-comparing-beach-parties-to-cabarets-and-porn-movies/";s:10:"post_title";s:57:"Stop Comparing Beach Parties To Cabarets And Porn Movies!";s:10:"post_image";s:59:"http://blogbaladi.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/beach1.jpg";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:123:"Every now and then, there’s a new article that comes out and bashes what’s happening at beach resorts in Lebanon and...";s:7:"blog_id";s:10:"blogbaladi";s:14:"post_timestamp";i:1405498680;s:12:"post_content";s:1630:"<p><img src="http://blogbaladi.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/beach1.jpg" alt="beach1" width="786" height="509"></p>
<p>Every now and then, there’s a new article that comes out and <a href="http://blogbaladi.com/fail-headline-of-the-day/">bashes what’s happening at beach resorts</a> in Lebanon and during beach parties. All of a sudden, foam parties turn into nudist parties and beach parties with exotic dancers turn into porn movies and cabarets. The funny thing about this <a href="http://www.aljoumhouria.com/news/index/153290">article</a> from Al Jomhouria is that the author seems to be ok with the nudist beaches in Mykonos and the gay-friendly atmosphere, yet is outraged by exotic dancers and hot beach parties. Moreover, have you seen what a cabaret looks like? Did you ever watch a porn film? How can you possibly compare dirty dancing and a drunk chick in a bikini to a porn movie?</p>
<p>There’s nothing wrong happening at these beach resorts in Lebanon and I am sure a lot of people are enjoying these parties and having a blast. These things happen all the time in Greece and Cyprus and people who don’t like it just don’t go there. It’s as simple as that. </p>
<p>Last but not least, the only way Lebanese will stop being so superficial and care about other’s looks is when they stop judging people for what they are and let them do whatever they wish to. That’s why no one cares how you dress or what you look like in Mykonos and homosexuals are accepted in their community. </p>

<p>Kourtney Kardashian and Scott Disick have just purchased the Calabasas estate of former NFL star wide receiver and current ESPN analyst Keyshawn Johnson. They are now neighbors with pop star Justin Bieber. I am not a fan of either one of them, but I thought it would be nice to check out a property they bought for $8.5 million!</p>

<p><em>From Trulia:</em></p>
<p><em>The house was listed in December 2012 for $10.5 million, but as Johnson’s issues with Bieber started to escalate, the asking price on his home started to drop bringing the home to $8.495 million. At that price, Kourtney Kardashian and Scott Disick swooped in and took the incredible home off Johnson’s hands.</em></p>
<p><em>Nestled inside the gated “Estates at the Oaks” community, the home sits on a huge 1.86 acre lot that boasts views and privacy. Inside, 6 bedrooms and 9 bathrooms are also joined by a chef’s kitchen, game and children’s play room, spa, sauna, elevator and theater.</em></p>
<p><em>The grounds of the estate include covered patios with an outdoor fireplace, sunken basketball/sports court, a pool with spa and expansive rolling lawns.</em></p>
