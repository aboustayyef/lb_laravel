Do you hear me Jack?"</span></i><br><br>After a highly generic season, I didn't expect this finale to be such a monumental gut-punch. But it was <b>glorious</b>. <br><br>Let me be this clear, this wasn't a <u>bad</u> season of <i>24</i>. It was well-executed, and it felt like classic Jack Bauer with the requisite double crosses, big bads, and shootouts. But it also didn't offer anything new (and maybe a large part of the audience wasn't craving that). But the television landscape has changed immensely since <i>24</i> left the airwaves in 2010. Bombshell twists have become a weekly occurrence, and shows today rarely shy away from killing off central characters (a feat that was <i>24</i>'s bread and butter back when it first stormed onto the scene). And aside from the show's unique format, this season felt largely derivative and by-the-numbers; nothing ever really surprised me throughout the course of these 12 episodes. I never felt like I was dying to watch the next episode. Instead, I kept watching out of habit and sheer loyalty to Jack Bauer (one of my most favorite characters of all time). <br><br>And that's why this finale was so good. It shocked me. In fact, it blew my brains out, particularly with the gruesome murder of Jack's one true love, Audrey. I honestly never expected the writing staff to kill her off after everything she'd been through, but ultimately, this act further reiterated something we've known all along: <i>24</i> is a tragic story, and Jack will never <i>really</i> get his happy ending. On the bright side, Audrey's death gave Jack a magnificent final rampage which Keifer Sutherland sold perfectly. The utter desolation on Jack's face after Kate's call, the hopelessness as he takes out his gun (undoubtedly read to off himself), and finally his renewed determination as he shoots, smashes and slices everyone in his path. It's a marvelous crescendo of violence that culminates with Jack brutally decapitating Cheng. And as horrifying as his act is, it's also strangely cheery-worthy and satisfying. <u><b>Wow. </b></u><br><br>Surprisingly, President Heller stood out as the show's MVP this year. William Devane delivered consistently solid work across the season, and he was downright transcendent in the finale. I found myself teary-eyed as the President heard the news of his daughter's passing and crashed to the ground. But I was astounded by his beautiful acceptance of his Alzheimer's during Audrey's burial, and his gratitude in the fact that he would eventually forget the traumas he endured. If I had doubts that the disease would serve any significant purpose in the beginning of the season, they were suitably put to rest by the time this grim and enormously haunting sequence came to light. <br><br>I know many people hated <i>24</i>'s series finale back in 2010 (with Jack ending his journey on the run), but I found it to be a pretty much perfect ending to the saga. So imagine my surprise when I loved this finale's ending as well. Jack gladly sacrificed his freedom in exchange for his "best friend" Chloe. It's a surprisingly uplifting sort of ending with Jack also finding penance for Audrey's death (the guilt would have eaten him alive). And naturally, Jack surviving the season means FOX will be investing in the show's return if the ratings are good enough. I just wonder if that's even necessary; can <i>24</i> ever really be groundbreaking again? I think I'd love to find out. <br><br><span><b>Ticking Bits</b></span><br><br>- Mark telling Jack that Audrey loves him made me smile. <br><br>- Again, I must stress how heartbreaking Audrey's death was. The fact that a tear streamed down her cheek before she accepted her death and peacefully closed her eyes was just harrowing. <br><br>- Time jump! First time ever on the show; didn't really feel all that special honestly. <br><br>- I don't know how I feel about Kate's character arc this year. Her quitting at the end made me feel like I invested in her plight for nothing. Still, it was great to see Jack trust her in saving Audrey (haha). <br><br>- I can't remember if I ever like Chloe during the show's original run (I binge-watched it all within the span of a month), but she did absolutely nothing for me this year. Still, I appreciate what she means to Jack and how pivotal she is to his journey.<br><br>- Seriously, that final helicopter sequence was beautiful. <br><br><span><b>Conclusion</b></span><br>An incredibly exciting and powerful closer to a somewhat disappointing season. If this is indeed the end, at least Jack Bauer's legacy was left intact. Superb. <br><br><span><b>Nad Rating</b></span><br><span><span><b>A</b></span></span></div></div>";s:17:"post_image_height";i:1026;s:16:"post_image_width";i:1600;s:11:"post_visits";i:4;s:18:"post_twitterShares";i:2;s:19:"post_facebookShares";i:6;s:16:"post_totalShares";i:8;s:16:"post_socialScore";i:13;s:13:"post_virality";i:17;s:9:"blog_name";s:13:"Nad's Reviews";s:16:"blog_description";s:72:"Nad's Reviews specializes in TV reviews as well as films and restaurants";s:8:"blog_url";s:27:"http://www.nadsreviews.com/";s:11:"blog_author";s:3:"Nad";s:28:"blog_author_twitter_username";s:11:"NadsReviews";s:13:"blog_rss_feed";s:54:"http://www.nadsreviews.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss";s:9:"blog_tags";s:18:"tv, culture, media";s:2:"id";i:162;s:11:"blog_active";i:1;s:24:"blog_last_post_timestamp";i:1405593540;s:6:"col_id";N;s:8:"col_name";N;s:16:"col_media_source";N;s:13:"col_home_page";N;s:13:"col_shorthand";N;s:26:"col_media_source_shorthand";N;s:27:"col_author_twitter_username";N;s:8:"col_tags";N;s:15:"col_description";N;s:23:"col_last_post_timestamp";N;}i:1;O:8:"stdClass":36:{s:7:"post_id";i:32867;s:8:"post_url";s:42:"http://www.plus961.com/2014/07/yeah-right/";s:10:"post_title";s:11:"Yeah right!";s:10:"post_image";s:78:"http://www.plus961.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/20140717-115217-42737223.jpg";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:123:"The ISF can forever claim that they have their “own ways” to stop these stupid motorbikers.

<p><strong>مسبح أو كاباريه؟</strong></p>
<p>ففي نهاية الأسبوع قررت الصديقات الاستجمام في لبنان وزيارة أحد المسابح المميزة التي تجمع اللبنانيين على اختلاف أعمارهم وطوائفهم وإنتماءاتهم السياسية، وتهتم بهم وتقدّم لهم «خدماتٍ خاصّة».</p>
<p>فإستُقبلن بحفاوة وترحيب كبيرين ودخلن المسبح الضخم محاولاتٍ الاختلاط بلبنانيين ولبنانيات أمثالهنّ لكنّ الامر لم ينجح. فما رأينه على شاطئ الـ«سي ف» اللبناني من مظاهر خلاعة وسكر ورقص مبتذل وتصرّفات وقحة غير أخلاقية يتجاوز بأشواط مشاهدَ العراة على الشواطئ اليونانية.</p>
<p>فلِيضمن المنتجع لرواده عيشهم تجربة مريحة ومسلية مليئة باللذة والمتعة والشغف، أوجد «باراً» في وسط بركة السباحة وسمح لعشاقه بإصطحاب مشروبهم معهم الى المياه. أما الموسيقى الحماسية التي يلعبها فتدفعهم الى الجنون وتطلق العنان لمخيّلتهم فيبتكرون رقصات مبتذلة تصل الى حدّ ممارسة الجنس علناً.</p>
<p>لا يكتفي المنتجع بتدليل زبائنه بهذا القدر فقط، وإنما في ذروة اللذة يحضر لهم ثلاث عارضات من جنسيات غير لبنانية يرقصن على المنصّة أمام أعين مئات الرجال والنساء، إلّا أنه لا يسمح إلّا للفتيات بمشاركة العارضات الرقص مباشرةً على المنصّة.</p>

<p>I found it really funny that back in the ’70s it was quite normal for Lebanese actors to french kiss in movies and even perform erotic scenes. Beirut also had licensed brothels and our newspapers used to <a title="Vibrator ad from the 60′s in Lebanon" href="http://www.plus961.com/2012/02/vibrator-ad-from-the-60s-in-lebanon/">advertise</a> <a title="Another vibrator ad from the 1960s" href="http://www.plus961.com/2013/06/another-vibrator-ad-from-the-1960s/">vibrators</a>!</p>
<p>Fast forward 40 years, sex toys are banned from the Lebanese market, we make a fuss in the press every time a couple of actors kiss on TV, and then comes a journalist from Al-Joumhouria criticizing the beach parties at C-Flow Jbeil which caters for adults only!!</p>

<p>These Cedar forests account for a quarter of the remaining cedar forest in Lebanon , and some tress are estimated to be 2,000 years old. The size of the reserve makes it a good location for the conservation of medium size mammals such as the wolf and the Lebanese jungle cat, as well as various species of mountain and plants.</p>

<p>The Al-Shouf Cedar Nature Reserve is a popular destination for hiking and trekking, with trails matching all levels of fitness. Bird watching, mountain biking and snow shoeing are also popular. From the summit of the rugged mountains, visitors will have a panoramic view of the countryside, eastward to the Beqaa Valley and Qaraoun Lake, and westward toward the Mediterranean.</p>

It reminded me of the project I did with Deborah Phares aka Abracadeborah (she can do magic!) entitled "Ma Jazz Kawlouhou" (another word play on the original expression, which means "what is permitted to be said). <a href="http://beirutntsc.blogspot.com/2012/06/ma-jazz-kawlouhou-abracadeborah-sings.html">Find the songs here and enjoy</a>!</div>";s:17:"post_image_height";i:337;s:16:"post_image_width";i:514;s:11:"post_visits";i:3;s:18:"post_twitterShares";i:1;s:19:"post_facebookShares";i:1;s:16:"post_totalShares";i:2;s:16:"post_socialScore";i:6;s:13:"post_virality";i:6;s:9:"blog_name";s:25:"Never Twice the Same City";s:16:"blog_description";s:33:"Beirut, Never Twice the Same City";s:8:"blog_url";s:30:"http://beirutntsc.blogspot.com";s:11:"blog_author";s:13:"Tarek Chemaly";s:28:"blog_author_twitter_username";s:10:"beirutntsc";s:13:"blog_rss_feed";s:50:"http://beirutntsc.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default";s:9:"blog_tags";s:19:"advertising, design";s:2:"id";i:16;s:11:"blog_active";i:1;s:24:"blog_last_post_timestamp";i:1405700520;s:6:"col_id";N;s:8:"col_name";N;s:16:"col_media_source";N;s:13:"col_home_page";N;s:13:"col_shorthand";N;s:26:"col_media_source_shorthand";N;s:27:"col_author_twitter_username";N;s:8:"col_tags";N;s:15:"col_description";N;s:23:"col_last_post_timestamp";N;}i:10;O:8:"stdClass":36:{s:7:"post_id";i:32859;s:8:"post_url";s:91:"http://ritachemaly.wordpress.com/2014/07/17/femmes-en-politique-au-liban-une-honte-en-2014/";s:10:"post_title";s:46:"Femmes en Politique au Liban une honte en 2014";s:10:"post_image";s:0:"";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:123:"Le nombre de Femmes en Politique au Liban est a mon avis honteux.

I've become a little obsessive with my skincare routine lately, and have finally found a formula that works for me, so I thought it would be a good time to have a little chit chat about it.</div><div><br><div><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-uE_AbxlWkxM/U8Z7FIty9lI/AAAAAAAAIes/0ljFAQtYH6Y/s1600/photo1+(2).jpg" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-uE_AbxlWkxM/U8Z7FIty9lI/AAAAAAAAIes/0ljFAQtYH6Y/s1600/photo1+(2).jpg" height="425" width="640"></a></div><br><br></div><div>My skin is not clear or perfect in any way, but I've been doing my best to improve it and I can definitely see the results. Before I delve into the products I use, I want to talk about a couple of things to keep in mind. My skin (all over my body, not just my face) is very weird. Whenever I have any form of injury on any part of my body, it takes a long time to heal and ALWAYS leaves a stupid scar. Being a very clumsy kid, and possibly even clumsier adult, I have accumulated my fair share of scars. Ever since I can remember, I've been very insecure about the scars on my body and up until my late teens, they were my main concern. Then one day, my face started to breakout and my insecurities of scarring shifted to my face. There was a point in time that I would die before I even thought about leaving the house without foundation or concealer because I was was THAT insecure about the marks all over. And even though I still do love the look of a flawless foundation face, I currently don't feel like crap if I leave the house without it. How did I FINALLY get to this stage?</div><br><div><b>RESEARCH </b></div><br><div>I can't even count how many skincare videos I've watched and how many <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/skincareaddiction">SkinCareAddiction</a> threads I've read to help me understand what products I should use, when to use them, what to avoid etc. When I first started getting into this whole skincare thing, I was the most confused puppy. My high school Chemistry teacher (hiii Mr. Tony Fares!) can vouch for me when I say that Chemistry was never my favorite subject in school so when it came to reading all the ingredients on the back of a bottle, I felt like an idiot (salasitic acid say whaa?). But over time, I began to learn about the silly sounding chemicals and their functions,  and I must admit that I feel like quiet the smartypants when I'm reading a random article about the subject because I actually know what they're talking about! There is nothing wrong with admitting you're clueless, you can always learn and become cluefull (KAH, ok... I'll stop).</div><br><div><b>TRIAL</b></div><div><br></div><div>After you've done your research, had some form of communication with a dermatologist, and have figured out what skin type you are (I'm normal with oily tendencies) it's time to test out products. If product X worked for Sarah, it doesn't mean it will work for you. If Jane uses ten products, it doesn't mean that you should too. It's not the number of products you use, it's the ingredients in the products and your skin type. Thankfully, I don't have particularly sensitive skin so this stage was not horrible. Going to the skincare section of a supermarket or the pharmacy now gives me almost the same high as going to a makeup counter or seeing new shoes.</div><br><div><b> GROW UP</b></div><br><div>Very obvious thing to state, right? When I was younger (not that I'm THAT old just yet), I used to fuss over every single little blemish that was on my face, and trust me there was a lot of blemishes to fuss over. I used to look other people's face and be envious of their flawless skin, or their ability to cover it properly. Over time, I found the right foundations and learned how to cover the flaws. After even more time, I began to understand the importance of actually fixing the problem and getting over the "flaws". So what if you have a pimple or a little scarring? Who cares? Even people with clear skin have a breakout every now and again. There are honestly more important things to worry about. All you can do is make an effort in nourishing and protecting your skin. Stop worrying about what others might think about your face, if they don't like it then let them look away :P</div><br><br><div><b>THE PRODUCTS</b></div><br>After a really long post, we get to the juicy bit.

Though partially deaf, Pierre Geagea, 34, expresses himself not through speech, but through his Mother Tongue - sign language - and contemporary dance.
  
  Born deaf, Pierre was unable to hear or speak until his mid-teens when, with the help of speech therapy and a huge amount of personal effort, he gradually developed the capacity to read lips. 
  
  In the show, Pierre performs on an almost completely bare stage using simple props, including a chair, a table and an aerial silk hammock. At times, a single spotlight dangles from the ceiling, highlighting Geagea's muscular curves and curly hair.
  
  There’s a spontaneous quality to Pierre’s work that translates beautifully into his artistic vision. “I don’t exactly think in terms of choreography. What I care about the most is [how] to integrate sign language and dance in my work,” he said. 
  
  
  
  Assistant Director Sara Maurice describes the show as a culmination of the dancer's own life experiences and development. “This was a show done by Pierre in May and now it’s coming back to the stage. They’ve worked on it a lot more so now it’s like taken to a new level. Pierre interacts with the music, the music interacts with him, and this definitely gives a certain mood to the piece,” she said. 
  
  Mother Tongue features live music from Sharif Sehnaoui and Tony Elieh, pioneer musicians on the Lebanese experimental music scene. The duo worked closely with Pierre to find a harmonious music-movement connection for the performance.
  
  With a childlike smile, Pierre says he was first inspired to dance by Michael Jackson and only became more serious about the effort after he began training at the age of 14 in different dance genres ranging from ballet and jazz to traditional dabkeh. “When I was around 10, I didn’t know much about dance but I used to love Michael Jackson,” he told Beirut.com. Later, turning his talent and passion to contemporary dance, he gradually formed his own distinct means of expression in a style that was further polished by choreographers from prominent Lebanese dance companies such as Caracalla, Arabesque and the Takween Collective. He also recounted his journey in France with La Mission de La Danse which has a special place in his heart. 
  
  Director Nadim Deaibes first worked with Pierre 13-years-ago in a show that became one of the first in Beirut to blend sign language and visual performance. “We got together again last year when I came back from France after assistant choreographer Daniel Balabane told me Pierre was putting on a new show,” Nadim explained. “Pierre came up with the concept and choreography, what we provided was an overall outside look on his existing work in order to pull all the different parts together."
  
  Nadim also made a precious observation about the major challenge of this production: achieving effective communication. Since Pierre primarily relies on lip reading,  this sort of pushed everyone on the team to make themselves clear while communicating. It was a challenge, but it made the group stronger as a whole.
  
  Pierre hopes shows like Mother Tongue will get more people involved in the deaf community in Lebanon and hopes one day the Ministry of Culture will take the initiative to implement effective learning opportunities for people with special needs.
  
  The 45-minute show opens tomorrow at Monnot Theater and is set to run until July 20. Tickets are on sale at all branches of Librairie Antoine and through Antoine Online.

<p><strong>2. Deek Duke Chicken Press Burger</strong> <a href="https://ivysays.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/8-press-burger-by-deek-duke.jpg"><img src="http://ivysays.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/8-press-burger-by-deek-duke.jpg?w=500&h=500" alt="8 press burger by deek duke" width="500" height="500"></a></p>
<p>You have to allow yourself <strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/deekdukerestaurant?fref=ts">Deek Duke’s</a> </strong>orgasmic Chicken Press Burger at least once ( though I doubt it will end there) A beautiful golden breaded three-cheese mix patty sits atop a juicy chunky grilled chicken breast and together they make little bites of love. And if that makes you feel guilty just do what I did, order it with a diet coke and a baked potato.<em>(it’s all in the head)</em> Deek Duke is now also open at City Mall Dora.</p>
<p><strong>3. Adidas Originals X Farm</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://ivysays.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/adidas-fifa-farm-sneakers-brazil.jpg"><img src="http://ivysays.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/adidas-fifa-farm-sneakers-brazil.jpg?w=500&h=605" alt="adidas FIFA FARM sneakers brazil" width="500" height="605"></a></p>
<p>The 2014 FIFA World Cup may be over, but these babies are here to stay. For the second time around, <strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/adidas?fref=ts">Adidas</a> </strong>has collaborated with the iconic Brazilian label The FARM Company to bring us this colorful carnival of vibrant and exotic colors. Adidas sent them over just in time for the finale and although Brazil lost miserably these sneakers definitely won!</p>
<p><strong>4. Helado Ice Cream</strong><a href="https://ivysays.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/9-helado-ice-cream-in-sahel-alma.jpg"><img src="http://ivysays.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/9-helado-ice-cream-in-sahel-alma.jpg?w=500&h=500" alt="9 Helado ice cream in sahel alma" width="500" height="500"></a></p>
<p>Literally a hidden gem in the crooked and curvy streets of Sahel Alma. <strong><a href="http://www.nogarlicnoonions.com/helado-knefe-whisky-figs-unique-and-innovative-ice-cream-flavors/">Anthony from No Garlic No Onions</a></strong> was the first to discover this homemade ice cream parlor that’s been around for more than 15 years. It’s always swarmed with people and the average wait can last up to 30 minutes but it’s totally worth it. Helado is the only spot in Lebanon to serve real flavors like Lotus Biscuit, Lebanese Wine, Knefe, and my personal favorite Framboise. This is not your average stretchy gooey Lebanese Ice Cream, this local spot gives Ben and Jerry’s a run for their money. Totally worth the ride.</p>
<p><strong>5. Maybelline New York Brazen Beige 732 Lipstick</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://ivysays.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/3-maybelline-new-york-beige-brazen-lipstick.jpg"><img src="http://ivysays.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/3-maybelline-new-york-beige-brazen-lipstick.jpg?w=500&h=500" alt="3 maybelline new york beige brazen lipstick" width="500" height="500"></a></p>
<p>Although most of us may shy away from heavy lipsticks and opt for light lip glosses when the temperatures are rising, you’ll be surprised how barely-there this Maybelline NY lipstick feels. It’s my go-to shade with my tan and has a versatile shade that works both day and night.</p>
<p><strong>6. Iftars</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://ivysays.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/iftars-1.jpg"><img src="http://ivysays.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/iftars-1.jpg?w=500&h=666" alt="iftars 1" width="500" height="666"></a></p>
<p>Having been born and raised in the UAE, Iftars were never just for adamant fasters, they were a part of the diverse culture, and became a wonderful social tradition that brought family friends together every day during Ramadan. So to keep the tradition alive I make sure they begin with my favorite two things, a hearty bowl of Lentil Soup and an amazing chilled glass of Ayran ( Laban Yogurt Drink) and then I go on to massacre the buffet.( Thank you <span>Le Ciel at Habtoor</span> for the amazing Iftar yesterday)</p>
<p><strong>7. Bonbon by <span>Viktor & Rolf</span></strong><a href="https://ivysays.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/7-bonbon-by-victor-and-rolf.jpg"><img src="http://ivysays.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/7-bonbon-by-victor-and-rolf.jpg?w=500&h=500" alt="7 bonbon by victor and rolf" width="500" height="500"></a></p>
<p>Sweet, delicious, decadent and feminine are just a few words to describe this newly launched fragrance by Viktor and Rolf. This light caramel-based scent is one of those perfumes that smells even better after an hour or two making it ideal for summer. If you like candy then I have no doubt you would enjoy Bonbon.</p>
<p><strong>8. Louboutin Iriza Pumps</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://ivysays.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/louboutin-so-kate.jpg"><img src="http://ivysays.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/louboutin-so-kate.jpg?w=500&h=500" alt="louboutin so kate" width="500" height="500"></a></p>
<p>The So Kates and Pigalles are wonderful classics but in my quest for the perfect classic Louboutin black pumps this summer I loved the sultry and open-sided design of the Iriza because they allow your foot to breath in this super hot weather. If you’re having trouble finding your size ( both Beirut and Paris are usually sold out) then you will be surprised to find a surplus of sizes at Dubai Mall.</p>
<p><strong>9. Crop Tops</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://ivysays.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/12-crop-tops.jpg"><img src="http://ivysays.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/12-crop-tops.jpg?w=500&h=500" alt="12 crop tops" width="500" height="500"></a></p>
<p>I’ve said it <a href="http://ivysays.com/2014/05/28/the-8-must-have-items-in-your-closet-this-summer/">before</a> and I’ll say it again. The beauty of crop tops is that you don’t have to have a Bündchen belly to be able to wear one. You can minimize/control mid-riff exposure by simply wearing a high waist skirt or shorts and it will keep you cool and refreshed in the scorching heat.</p>
<p><strong>10. Abd El Wahab</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://ivysays.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/abdel-wahab.jpg"><img src="http://ivysays.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/abdel-wahab.jpg?w=500&h=500" alt="abdel wahab" width="500" height="500"></a></p>
<p>I used to order their Plat Du Jour almost every day for 4 years when I was working full-time. Having earned it’s rank as one of the best Lebanese restaurants in Lebanon, Abd El Wahab never fails with its classic oriental decor and heavenly mezza. I was very proud to celebrate their 15 anniversary with them last month on their gorgeous terrace and will be back for an Iftar or two this summer.</p>
<p><strong>11. Bonita Bay</strong><a href="https://ivysays.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/6-tanning.jpg"><img src="http://ivysays.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/6-tanning.jpg?w=500&h=500" alt="6 tanning" width="500" height="500"></a></p>
<p>Bonita Bay is one of Batroun’s landmarks and one of those places that never fails to attract sunshine even when Jounieh is looking bleak and grey. I’ve been adamant about getting a tan this summer and there was something about the way the sun hit Bonita Bay that made it ideal for tanning. The only downside is that it’s not a sandy beach but rather a pebbled one, so be prepared to see a lot of people trip and fall as well as some embarrassing moments of your own.</p>
<p><strong>12. Passion Fruit Body Butter by The Body Shop</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://ivysays.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/2-body-shop-body-butter-passion-fruit.jpg"><img src="http://ivysays.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/2-body-shop-body-butter-passion-fruit.jpg?w=500&h=478" alt="2 body shop body butter passion fruit" width="500" height="478"></a></p>
<p>My friends and I used to drench our skin in this rich good stuff after hours of soaking up the harsh UAE sun. It’s actually one of the all-time favorites from The Body Shop because no matter what those after-sun products say, nothing can help sooth a sun burn like this intensive shea butter tub. It will last for months on end and will leave your skin looking moisturized for hours and hours after use. I’ve tried it in coconut, mango, olive, papaya and strawberry but my favorite hands down is the purple Passion Fruit one.</p>

<p>The announcement is expected before the financial markets open on Thursday morning. The layoffs are expected to  surpass the 5,800  workers cut during the 2009 crisis, all part of the $600 million cost savings initiative that the previous management had promised would come from the Nokia acquisition.</p>

Talk of cuts come 1 week after <a title="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/news/ceo/index.html" href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/news/ceo/index.html">Nadella sent a memo to workers</a> introducing a new vision for the company with focus on mobile and cloud computing.</p>

Am used to receiving my clothes on wire hangers like these from the dry cleaner. But recently my closet that fits my dresses (I hang them in a closet on their own) was jammed and too crowded. Nothing would fit, and hanging back something in place was a nightmare. Why? Mainly because I always thought these hangers were cheap and always opted for nice wooden structured ones. Well they kicked the space out of my closet and it was a nightmare fitting anything in. My husband pointed out that if I used these wire hangers my life would soon be in more bliss and we would reach destinations earlier (given the fact I fight time when I need to access something from this closet). And there it was. I replaced all my wooden hangers with these simple <strike>cheap</strike> ones (had to beg the dry cleaner for more). Everything looks intact. And you know what? I actually do have more space. So on another thought? I need to go shopping to fill that gap! </div><div>Do not use these for nicely structured blazers though.

<p>Today, “there are unsold apartments,” says Massaad Fares, CEO of Prime Consult. Getting more personal, Fares says that “slightly more than half” of his company’s mixed-use Sama Beirut is sold. The tower near Sodeco Square is the city’s tallest building and is set to be delivered in 2015.<span> </span></p>
<p><span>There are indications the real estate market may be picking back up. Cement deliveries in the first four months of 2014, according to the most recent data, are up 9 percent compared to the same period in 2013. Both the number of real estate transactions and the value of said transactions are also up, but Jihad Ibrahim, general manager of Jamil Ibrahim Establishment, tells Executive that these last two figures can be misleading.</span></p>
<p><b>Slow years for development companies</b></p>
<p>The number and value of transactions are recorded at the General Directorate for Real Estate Affairs when apartments are handed over, not when contracts are signed (i.e., when sales happen), Ibrahim says. He notes that many developers focus heavily on off-plan sales, so many contracts are signed years before they are registered.</p>
<p><span>Therefore, increases in the number and value of transactions are not reliable indicators of new sales activity, he argues. </span></p>
<p>In the nation’s capital, “the only oxygen in the market is in the low-income segment,” says Ibrahim, whose family owned development company builds multimillion dollar flats for the top 1 percent of buyers.</p>
<p>Ibrahim’s firm has been particularly hard hit by the slow years. He says 40 percent of his stock is unsold and he’s sitting on parcels of land that should be holes in the ground by now.</p>
<p>“We’re finishing the projects we have on hand, and there are three or four big projects, and we stopped everything else,” he says. “We have seven projects with their permits ready that were supposed to be phased in … What we did was completely stop to see what we’ll do with the stock we have on hand.”</p>
<p>While 2014 may reverse the trend, real estate transactions reported to the country’s official registry had been shrinking in number since 2011, after nearly a decade of growth. Prices, however, have not followed transactions south given the particularities of Lebanon’s real estate market — its size is small, developers are not heavily leveraged, domestic demand is steady and expatriates are hungry for a slice of their homeland, even if that appetite can be suppressed by political and security instability.</p>
<p>While new projects (both big and small) are still being announced, Premiere Properties’ CEO Antoine Habr says developers are taking their time before launching new ventures.</p>
<p>“Business doesn’t stop, it just slows down,” he says. “I would say, instead of jumping immediately to the next idea or the next opportunity, people would [want to] take more time to analyze the market, study, recruit the right people to give them the right feedback and information, and [do] more pre-work preparation before jumping to the next opportunity like everyone used to do.”</p>
<p>With an eye on better times, Prime Consult’s Fares says many developers are buying up space for future use.</p>
<p>“They are all now buying land,” he says. “Developers, instead of developing, are buying the land, preparing the plans and taking their time in preparation.”</p>
<p>Habr argues it’s a buyer’s market all round.</p>
<p>“This is the right time to buy. This is the right time to invest,” he says. “There’s more room for negotiation on all levels. Definitely you can have good opportunities out there. There are no panic sales or anything, it’s just that when you sit with somebody, you’ll be able to negotiate better and get more of what you want, more than [you could] before.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, for Ibrahim, land is an extra revenue stream in times he says are so tough that the company is laying off employees “for the first time in our history.”</p>
<p>He says the company has purchased large tracts of land in the Bekaa and the South, which is partially being developed into low-cost housing by subcontractors and partially sold at a profit.</p>
<p><b>Buying land in the meantime</b></p>
<p>“We’re not interested in the return on the construction, it is so insignificant for us,” says Ibrahim. “What’s significant is when you take a big lot, divvy it up and then sell it; there, the internal rate of return is much, much higher. When construction stops, we go into related businesses, which is land appropriation. We can afford to do that, keep ourselves busy, but it’s definitely not the answer.”</p>
<p>While groundbreakings may be fewer and farther between, there are new projects in the pipeline. Sayfco Holding announced late last year that it would be taking a 50,000-square-meter bite into the Mediterranean to build a new, $1 billion resort in Zouk, just north of Beirut. The company says it has a permit to reclaim land from the sea for the project that will sprawl over 100,000 square meters and become the country’s largest resort.</p>
<p>Fares says Prime Consult recently bought some 100,000 square meters of land on the Metn highway and is in negotiations to buy land in Jounieh — he refuses to reveal where — also for a resort.</p>
<p><span>Habr also teases details of a “well studied,” soon-to-be announced, two-tower gated community in the Mar Rukouz area of the eastern suburbs of Beirut. Like Premiere Properties’ other projects, the new one will utilize a dedicated, audited account with a major local bank for any money made off of pre-</span>sales.</p>
<p>“We guarantee in this way that the funds of this project are dedicated to the construction of the project and not for speculation toward other investments, whether it be in real estate or for personal use,” Habr says.</p>
<p>“This is an initiative from the private sector whereby a few private developers are implementing this business model. But it’s not a [law]. That’s the problem. Like in Dubai or London or anywhere in Europe … it’s imposed by the legislation. In Lebanon it’s not.”</p>
<p>Of the new development’s location, Habr says the area is attractive because of its proximity to Beirut.</p>
<p>Fares calls the eastern suburbs “the future.” “The land in Beirut has become so expensive, it has become prohibitive to buy an apartment in Beirut,” he says.</p>
<p>An interesting question moving forward is what the future will hold for both the eastern suburbs and the rest of the country. To date, there has been no <span>real long-term urban planning for the country’s development, and legislation has consistently become more friendly to developer’s wants (see “<a href="http://www.executive-magazine.com/business-finance/real-estate/higher-regulation" target="_blank">Higher Regulation</a>“). A common theme that emerged from the interviews for this report is that developers will continue to buy up large parcels of land for self-sustained — often gated — communities. </span></p>
<p><span>What is unclear is whether or not the public sector — be it on the national level or in municipal offices — is thinking of how to oversee such future developments or how feasible it will be to tame the sprawling regulatory framework currently in place.</span></p>
