It’s refreshing to see writer/director Jon Favreau go back to his indie roots, following a series of big Hollywood blockbusters like “Iron Man” and “Cowboys & Aliens”. He also plays the central character Carl Casper, a master chef at a chic L.A restaurant. When a famous food blogger (those bastards!) ruins his career, Carl finds himself without a job. The plot itself is so light a whisper could blow it away. But don’t let this bring you down. “Chef” is actually a delicious treat from start to finish. All the actors deliver the goods, with Favreau and the underrated John Leguizamo working the necessary magic. It’s the pleasure of their company that makes this a feel good movie. In his uniquely funny and unexpectedly tender ways, Favreau takes us on an unforgettable food journey. Don’t miss it.</p>

As a result, “Maleficent” (Angelina Jolie’s major comeback since 2010′s “The Tourist”)- a spin on Sleeping Beauty for audiences who really think they need another one- offers sets, costumes and images to make us drool. But what’s inside the frame? Nothing much. The script by Linda Woolverton is a model of paper thin storytelling and a lot of good actors go down with it. Start with Angelina Jolie, who tries hard, too hard as the peaceful fairy who turns into a villain when the love of her life betrays her. Years later, she puts a curse on his baby girl, Aurora. No need to reveal more. You probably know how this ones goes. Elle Fanning plays the older version of Aurora and she gives it her best shot as well. But it’s not enough. You can sense that there’s something missing. But hey just in case you’re wondering why we’re being punished with a series of revisionist fairy tales, the apparent reason is that Hollywood sensed a hit in the making when Tim Burton’s “Alice in Wonderland” was released a few years ago and wound up making a lot of money. That got various Hollywood filmmakers thinking that the audience was eager to see new versions of “Snow White”, “Red Riding Hood” and now “Sleeping Beauty”. Well suck on it Hollywood. I suspect most people went to see “Maleficent” because of Angelina Jolie. But even she can’t save it from being pointless and forgettable.</p>

<p><strong><span>I wasn’t exactly looking forward to <em>Maleficent.</em> Recent re-tellings and re-imaginings of classic stories and fairytales like <em>Snow White and the Huntsman</em> and<em> Alice in Wonderland </em>have left me quite cold, so I just wasn’t expecting much. I’m sad to say that my apprehensions were validated; excluding Angelina Jolie’s captivating performance, this new spin on the classic <em>Sleeping Beauty </em>tale does absolutely nothing to enhance the story, and actually detracts from it. The film is essentially a giant, expensive excuse to cast Jolie in the iconic role, and while that does pay some dividends, a good movie it is not.</span></strong></p>
<p><span>The story is very much based on the original <em>Sleeping Beauty</em>, except that this time, the story is told from Maleficent’s (Angelina Jolie) perspective. We meet our title character as a young faerie living in a magical realm knowns as The Moors. When young Maleficent meets a human peasant called Stefan (adult version played by Sharlto Copley), the two fall in love and build a long-lasting relationship. Problem is, Stefan is more preoccupied with becoming king, and when he’s given the chance to ascend to the throne by defeating Maleficent, his lust for power ultimately leads him to betray her. Maleficent, now full of anger and hatred, decides to pay King Stefan back by cursing his newborn baby girl with a curse, which leads us to a slight re-imagining of the events we all know.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://ageeksblogdotcom1.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/maleficent-movie-wallpaper-2.jpg"><img src="http://ageeksblogdotcom1.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/maleficent-movie-wallpaper-2.jpg?w=650&h=352" alt="maleficent-movie-wallpaper-2"></a></p>
<p><span>Although I have my fair share of problems with the film (which I’ll get into soon), I can’t deny that Angelina Jolie is absolutely magnificent in the role. She’s magnetic as the mistress of all evil, and the audience I was with cheered every time her character did something remotely badass. I’ll admit that even I joined in a few times out of sheer excitement. Even with horns, wings, and really intense cheek bones, she looks stunning. And that, my friends, is pretty much the only good thing about <em>Maleficent.</em></span></p>
<p><span>For one, the story didn’t work for me. The only reason it’s tolerable is because it’s based on such great source material, but every deviation this story took absolutely did not work for me. According to this version,  Maleficent becomes the mistress of all evil is because she was betrayed by a man. Really? One of the most recognizable villains in the history of popular culture came to existence because of a failed relationship with a dude? Come on guys; you can do better than that.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://ageeksblogdotcom1.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/sharlto-copely-as-king-stefan.jpg"><img src="http://ageeksblogdotcom1.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/sharlto-copely-as-king-stefan.jpg?w=650&h=433" alt="sharlto-copely-as-king-stefan"></a></p>
<p><span>Also, the visual effects were far from impressive, which is extremely disappointing when you consider that director Robert Stromberg was a VFX artist and designer for many years before making his directing debut with <em>Maleficent</em>. A lot of the creatures looked pretty awful, including those weird goblins, the faeries, and anything green screen related. And if you think the film looks similar to <em>Alice in Wonderland </em>and <em>Oz: The Great and the Powerful, </em>it’s because Stromberg was a VFX artist on those films as well (yikes!).</span></p>
<p><span>The worst part about Maleficent, though, is that it managed to make Sharlto Copley give a terrible performance. I personally thought Copley could do no wrong, but sadly, there’s nothing redeemable about his performance as Stefan, and I was cringing any time he opened his mouth. I did really like Elle Fanning as Aurora, but she wasn’t given much to do except smile and act impressed at all the fake CGI stuff floating around. </span></p>

<p><span><strong>The Verdict:</strong></span></p>
<p><span>Angelina Jolie deserves every bit of credit she’s getting for her performance as Maleficent. The rest of the movie? Eh, not so much.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Numerical Score: 5.5/10</strong></span></p>

It reunites the team that made the first one so successful (without Jason Segel though and that’s a shame), including director James Bobin, and opens with a song called “We’re doing a sequel”. Nice try, but too much self awareness can ruin a picture, especially with characters that we love and admire. The plot this time around involves a ruthless agent (Ricky Gervais), who plans to have Kermit sent to the Gulag, while his evil Russian double replaces him on tour. From this point on, there is sufficient story, songs and gags to fill out an hour long TV special. Unfortunately, “Muppets Most Wanted” runs 108 minutes, and at some point you can feel the life draining from it. Is the movie still entertaining? Damn straight. It’s always a pleasure to see Kermit, Fozzie, Miss Piggy and the rest of the gang back onscreen. But truth be told, they deserve a better movie. And so do we.</p>

Well, sort of.</div><div><br></div><div>Ever since I heard the news of a <i>Boys Meets World</i> sequel coming to life (back in November 2012), I got really excited. The show was an inspirational hit when I was growing up, and one of the few ‘90s shows that I still gladly watch in reruns on a late Sunday night. So the thought of seeing Cory and Topanga on my screen in 2014 seemed like a fan-fiction dream come true.</div><div><br></div><div>With this news though, came the dread that the new show might stink. While it still hasn’t aired on the Disney Channel (June 27), the pilot was released on Disney Now and can be found online.</div><div><br></div><div>There’s definitely a sense of nostalgia while watching <i>Girl Meets World</i> - seeing Cornelius (I just love saying that) and Topanga together on screen brings back beautiful flashbacks - but the entire show screams “Disney”.</div><div><br></div><div>The horrible, horrible laugh-track plus the tacky dialogue, the wacky characters, the very bright colors, the clothes and a lot more were just too “Disney” for my taste. Obviously, it had to be because unlike <i>Boy Meets World,</i> this show is aimed more at kids under the age of 15. I can’t see it going down the same road <i>BMW</i> took (no pun intended) simply because its predecessor tackled many serious issues and was more about life lessons than this show can possibly ever become. Also, how many times do you have to say the word “world” in the first episode? That was very lame.</div><div><br></div><div>Maybe <i>BMW</i>’s entire first season was just as goofy and Disney-like as the first episode of <i>GMW</i>, so that would mean the show could possibly become a hit (although I just can’t see it going that way). Either way, little things like the character of Farkle Minkus (yes, Minkus!!) was handled hideously. He was just an annoying little kid trying to be funny, but that scene with him randomly jumping on Cory’s back was beyond frustrating.</div><div><br></div><div>It helps that the lead character, Riley Mathews (C & T’s daughter), is likeable (but only a little) and her best friend, Maya (the new Shawn), is interesting enough to give this show another chance, but I only kept watching because I wanted to see more Cory and more Topanga (seriously, where was she during the rest of the episode?).</div><div><br></div><div>Luckily, they knew how to wow us with that final cameo appearance of Mr. Feeny, a scene that was incredibly moving (and has to be for any <i>BMW</i> fan) regardless of how short it was. That five-second moment made the entire episode worth it.</div><div><br></div><div><span><b>Quick Thoughts</b></span></div><div><br></div><div>- The opening song “Take On The World” is very catchy!</div><div><br></div><div>- So Cory and Topanga also have a son named Auggie who was barely seen in the first episode besides a small scene with Riley.</div><div><br></div><div>- Anything with Riley and Maya trying to talk to the new boy Lucas (obviously the love interest for Riley) was cringe-worthy.</div><div><br></div><div>- Many old faces will return for <i>GMW</i> including the much-anticipated return of Shawn (this shall be good!), Cory’s parents and brother, Stuart Minkus, Harley and Fee-ee-ny!</div><div><br></div><div>- I really thought Topanga became a stay-at-home mom, which is what it seems like from this episode, but Wikipedia says she does become a lawyer at that New York City law firm we heard so much about in the <i>BMW</i> finale! I’m a sucker for continuity, and so far this show is doing it well.</div><div><br></div><div>- So this episode was filmed in front of a live studio audience and yet we still have to bear that awful fake laugh-track? Why do you do this to me, Disney?</div><div><br></div><div>- The opening scene was actually amusing. Great choice having Cory and Topanga show up right from the start and all those years later, these two still have undeniable chemistry!</div><div><br></div><div><span><b>Conclusion</b></span></div><div>I admit the only times the pilot was somehow amusing was any time there was a <i>Boy Meets World </i>reference. All the other times, this was just a typical unwatchable Disney comedy.</div><div><br></div><div><span><b>Chris Rating</b></span></div><div><span><span><b>B-</b></span></span></div></div>";s:17:"post_image_height";i:1065;s:16:"post_image_width";i:1600;s:11:"post_visits";i:15;s:18:"post_twitterShares";i:2;s:19:"post_facebookShares";i:10;s:16:"post_totalShares";i:12;s:16:"post_socialScore";i:25;s:13:"post_virality";i:20;s:9:"blog_name";s:13:"Nad's Reviews";s:16:"blog_description";s:72:"Nad's Reviews specializes in TV reviews as well as films and restaurants";s:8:"blog_url";s:27:"http://www.nadsreviews.com/";s:11:"blog_author";s:3:"Nad";s:28:"blog_author_twitter_username";s:11:"NadsReviews";s:13:"blog_rss_feed";s:54:"http://www.nadsreviews.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss";s:9:"blog_tags";s:18:"tv, culture, media";s:2:"id";i:162;s:11:"blog_active";i:1;s:24:"blog_last_post_timestamp";i:1401652500;}i:9;O:8:"stdClass":26:{s:7:"post_id";i:30507;s:8:"post_url";s:59:"http://monkyseemonkydo.com/2014/06/01/•ry-x•howling•/";s:10:"post_title";s:20:"•RY X•Howling•";s:10:"post_image";s:68:"http://monkyseemonkydo.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/ry-x-press-2.jpeg";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:110:"Filed under: I breathe music Tagged: Australia, howling, Indie, indie music, music blog, RY X, song of the day";s:7:"blog_id";s:15:"monkyseemonkydo";s:14:"post_timestamp";i:1401621240;s:12:"post_content";s:275:"Filed under: I breathe music Tagged: Australia, howling, Indie, indie music, music blog, RY X, song of the day<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=monkyseemonkydo.com&blog=36366745&post=3124&subd=monkyseemonkydo&ref=&feed=1" width="1" height="1">";s:17:"post_image_height";i:602;s:16:"post_image_width";i:905;s:11:"post_visits";i:0;s:18:"post_twitterShares";i:0;s:19:"post_facebookShares";i:10;s:16:"post_totalShares";i:10;s:16:"post_socialScore";i:9;s:13:"post_virality";i:18;s:9:"blog_name";s:15:"monkyseemonkydo";s:16:"blog_description";s:243:"Dietitian and Enthusiast from Lebanon living in Dubai..

<p><strong><span>I’m a big Seth MacFarlane fan. I love <em>Family Guy</em>, although I’d be lying if I said I was still keeping up with the latest episodes. While I really enjoyed <em>Ted</em>, I wasn’t as into it as I wanted to be, and couldn’t help but feel like MacFarlane could have done more with his directorial debut. Well, MacFarlane is back with <em>A Million Ways to Die in the West, </em>not only as the film’s director, but as its leading star as well. So how does his follow-up effort fare? Not too badly, actually.</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Seth MacFarlane plays Albert Stark, a cowardly sheep farmer living in the American Frontier. When his girlfriend Louise (Amanda Seyfried) dumps him after he embarrasses himself in a duel, he losese the only thing that mattered to him. He eventually meets Anna (Charlize Theron), a beautiful but mysterious dame who helps him find his courage just in time for the arrival of Clinch Leatherwood (Liam Neeson), the most dangerous outlaw in the West.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://ageeksblogdotcom1.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/a-million-ways-to-die-in-the-west.jpg"><img src="http://ageeksblogdotcom1.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/a-million-ways-to-die-in-the-west.jpg?w=650" alt="a-million-ways-to-die-in-the-west"></a></p>
<p><span>I’ll be the first to admit that<em> A Million Ways to Die in the West </em>has its fair share of problems, but it’s also a consistently funny comedy that will have you laughing throughout its two-hour running time. If you’ve ever watched anything MacFarlane has worked on in the past, then you know exactly what kind of humor to expect, and there’s plenty of it here. Much like <em>Ted</em>, it can feel like an extended <em>Family Guy </em>episode, which isn’t a bad thing if you enjoy this brand of humor. The Wild West is picked apart here, and the results are often hilarious. </span></p>
<p><span>My biggest complaint about the film would be that MacFarlane is the star of the show. I love his comedy and his voice work, but that doesn’t necessarily mean it translates into a solid live-action performance. His inexperience as an actor becomes more and more apparent as he shares the screen with infinitely more talented actors like Charlize Theron, Giovanni Ribisi, and Neil Patrick Harris, just to name a few.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://ageeksblogdotcom1.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/maxresdefault1.jpg"><img src="http://ageeksblogdotcom1.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/maxresdefault1.jpg?w=650&h=364" alt="maxresdefault"></a></p>
<p><span>MacFarlane also doesn’t at all feel like a guy who grew up in the West; rather more like a guy who was plucked from present-day Los Angeles and dumped there for fun. While that may be what he’s going for, it would have been more appropriate if time-travel was an element in the story. Still, it’s a testament to MacFarlane’s writing and directing ability that the film remains as funny as it is, even though it would have strongly benefited from a different actor in the lead.</span></p>
<p><span>Although I was laughing till the very end,<span> the film is easily about 20 minutes too long; s</span>ome pacing issues near the film’s last half hour really began to test my patience. I thought the rest of the cast did a fantastic job, and was particularly taken by Giovanni Ribisi and Sarah Silverman, who play an extremely weird couple you won’t soon forget. Theron, Neeson, and NPH also bring their A-game, and give the film some much-needed gravitas. There are also a handful of blink-and-you’ll-miss-them cameos, so keep your eyes peeled!</span></p>

<p><span><strong>The Verdict:</strong></span></p>
<p><span>Funny and irreverent,  <em>A Million Ways to Die in the West </em>manages to overcome its faults to be a solidly entertaining comedy. It most certainly won’t be half as popular as <em>Ted</em>, but it proves that MacFarlane has what it takes to deliver an effective summer comedy. It’s a tad self-indulgenet and would have benefited from a different lead actor, but how much does that matter when the laughs keep on coming?</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Numerical Score: 7.5/10</strong></span></p>

And thus, there are so few genuine <b>movie stars</b> left in this day and age. Tom Cruise, Will Smith, Sandra Bullock... each of these players elevates every project they partake in with their special brand of talent and charisma. Angelina Jolie is undoubtedly at the top of this list, and<i> Maleficent </i>terrifically demonstrates why that is the case.  </div><div><br></div><div>Simply put, Jolie is downright spectacular in <i>Maleficent</i>. The voice, the mannerisms, the horns - every element of the iconic Disney villainess is brought to life with extraordinary detail and finesse. Jolie imbues the rule with a range of emotion, and she clearly relishes playing the role of a lifetime. The actress not only tackles the film's dramatic beats beautifully, but she nails a number of comedic moments that prove to be enormously memorable. In the end, Jolie transcends the material and turns the legendary character into a complex, full-dimensional woman with depth and nuance. </div><div><br></div><div>Interestingly enough, the event that sets the film's plot in motion (Maleficent and her wings), is a powerful metaphor for rape (as Jolie recently <a href="http://www.hitfix.com/news/angelina-jolie-on-maleficent-and-her-daughters-debut">made clear</a>). It's inspired to witness the actress tackle a cause she so adamantly rallies against within a classic fairytale (her chilling screams during the scene in question are particularly harrowing). Has there ever been an actress more committed to her humanitarian causes <b>and </b>her craft? Wow.</div><div><br></div><div>In terms of weaknesses, Elle Fanning is somewhat frustrating as Aurora. Perhaps the blame lies in the script which doesn't give her much to do besides grin like an idiot and befriend forest creatures, but her role became irritating quite fast. In addition, I could have done with a bit less voiceovers. Angelina's face is tremendously expressive, and she really doesn't need so much exposition going on in the background to convey her thoughts and feelings. </div><div><br></div><div>Straying from spoilers, I will say that the film's ending is a satisfying one, capably bringing the tale to a rousing (and surprisingly action-packed) conclusion. First-time director Robert Stromberg does an excellent job, and his production design experience from <i>Avatar</i> is effecitvely utilized in the film's impressive CGI sequences. Furthermore, <i>Maleficent's </i>musical score (courtesy of James Newton Howard) is suitably majestic, while the film's final sequence feels pretty perfect. </div><div><br></div><div>Thankfully, I made the wise decision of watching the film in 2D. Apart from <i>Avatar</i> and <i>Life of PI</i>, the majority of the 3D films that I've seen have failed to capitalize on the technology, robbing movies of their brightness and detail. I would urge you to do the same, as <i>Maleficent</i>'s color palette is a gorgeous one, and it would be a shame to have to experience the adventure in anything less. </div><div><br></div><div><span><b>Conclusion</b></span></div><div>Stunningly brought to life and spearheaded by Jolie's phenomenal performance, <i>Maleficent</i> is a unique reimagining of the Sleepy Beauty tale.

<p>The Dø (pronounced “doh,” like the first note of the solfege scale) is an indie pop French/Finnish duo based in Paris.</p>
<p>I initially discovered them in 2011 with “On My Shoulders” and their latest track “Keep Your Lips Sealed” was released recently.</p>
<p>For similar vibes, I recommend checking the danish psychedelic pop band The Asteroids Galaxy Tour (previously covered <a href="http://sillygoon.com/2013/09/04/the-asteroids-galaxy-tour-fun-beats-from-denmark/" target="_blank">here</a> on Silly Goon).</p>

<p>TĀLĀ only has 3 public sounds released since April 2014 (“The Duchess”, “Serbia” and “Other People’s Poetry” which was published yesterday) but she has been featured in most of the music and culture sites already (<a href="http://www.gorillavsbear.net/tag/tala/" target="_blank">Gorilla vs Bear</a>, <a href="http://www.thefader.com/2014/05/02/tala-interview/" target="_blank">The Fader</a>, <a href="http://www.dazeddigital.com/music/article/19842/1/trip-out-with-t-l-s-underground-pop" target="_blank">DAZED</a>, <a href="http://pigeonsandplanes.com/2014/04/tala-the-duchess/" target="_blank">Pigeons and Planes</a>, <a href="http://www.hillydilly.com/2014/04/tala-the-duchess/" target="_blank">Hilly Dilly</a>, etc).</p>
<p>I am not surprised about this quick buzz, her “marketing” profile makes her quite hot nowadays: she is born and bred in modern South West London but she is from traditional Persian descent (hence, and as she explains, her music reflects this contrast that defines her); her stage name means “gold” in farsi, “palm trees” in Sanskrit, and is an Indian term for rhythm; and her 3 singles are electro pop but at the same time hypnotic and experimental.</p>
<p>I am curious to hear more on her EP “The Duchess”, which will be released on <a href="http://aesoplabel.com/" target="_blank">June 2 on Aesop Label</a>.</p>
<p>In the meantime, her tracks are updated on her <a href="https://soundcloud.com/talaofficial" target="_blank">SoundCloud channel</a>, and her music video for “Serbia” is quite trippy (it was inspired by Srđan Spasojević’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddwrbcMmzlc" target="_blank">A Serbian Film</a>, which was banned in ten countries for its horrific depictions of necrophilia and sexual abuse).</p>

It’s a reminder of what a good actor he can be and that’s something we haven’t seen onscreen in a very long time. Director David Gordon Green returns to his indie roots after a series of Hollywood disappointments (“Your Highness”, “The Sitter”) with an intriguing fable that recalls last year’s underrated “Mud”. His film takes place in a small community, where an ex-con (Cage) supervises a group of hard-working men who spend all day replacing sick trees with healthier variety. One day, he meets a young boy called Gary (a terrific Tye Sheridan) who asks to join his crew. We also meet his daddy, who enjoys beating the crap out of him. As Joe learns more about this kid, he decides to take him under his wing. If you’ve seen “Mud”, then you should know that “Joe” unfolds at a deliberate pace, which suits this mode of storytelling. We come to feel as we know all the characters who populate the story, including the working men and the townies. This is the kind of film where tiny details and vignettes convey more than long speeches possibly could. The cast couldn’t be better, with Nicolas Cage on top of his game after years of disappointments. I realize that a movie like “Joe” may not be every moviegoer’s cup of tea, but I fell under its spell almost instantly and I hope it finds the audience it deserves.</p>

<p><strong><span>Despite earning some of the year’s strongest reviews, <em><a href="http://ageeksblog.com/2014/05/21/movie-review-x-men-days-of-future-past-2014/">X-Men: Days of Future Past</a> </em>failed to create much of an impression during its opening weekend. While it still opened in the top spot, its 12,777 admissions really aren’t all that impressive. The film’s opening trails behind similar summer releases like <em>The Amazing Spider-Man 2 </em>(25,326)<em>, Godzilla </em>(18,625)<em>, </em>and even<i> </i><em>Captain America: The Winter Soldier </em>(13,711)<em>. </em>I’m personally quite puzzled by these numbers.</span></strong></p>
<p><span>In its second weekend in theaters, <em><span><a href="http://ageeksblog.com/2014/05/13/movie-review-godzilla-2014/">Godzilla</a></span> </em>plummeted by 69% to 7,008 admissions and a new total of 29,775.  The film took a big hit thanks to the arrival of the latest X-Men flick, as well as pretty mixed word-of-mouth. <em><span><a href="http://ageeksblog.com/2014/04/17/movie-review-neighbors-2014/">Neighbors</a></span> </em>dropped to third place with 3,921 admissions. The R-rated comedy dipped by a slim 48% for an impressive total of 22,388.</span></p>
<p><span>In fourth place,<em> <span><a href="http://ageeksblog.com/2014/04/29/movie-review-the-amazing-spider-man-2-2014/">The Amazing Spider-Man 2</a></span> </em>added another 3,496 admissions for a mighty total of 55,531 tickets sold so far. That represents a decent drop of 52% week-over-week. Fifth place went to <em><span><a href="http://tlkabtmovies.com/2014/05/15/grace-of-monaco-2014/">Grace of Monaco</a></span>,</em> which experienced a steep 65% drop from last week to 3,470 admissions, and a total sum of 13,475. <em><span><a href="http://ageeksblog.com/2014/04/25/movie-review-the-other-woman-2014/">The Other Woman</a></span> </em>dropped to sixth place with an additional 1,721 admissions for an excellent tally of 38,026, making this a bigger hit than anyone could have hoped for.</span></p>
<p><span>The rest of the top 10 saw a number of new releases bomb pretty hard. <em><a href="http://tlkabtmovies.com/2014/04/01/the-bag-man-2014/">The Bag Man</a>, <a href="http://tlkabtmovies.com/2014/04/16/oculus-2014/">Oculus</a>, </em>and<em> Legends of Oz: Dorothy’s Return </em>all opened to less than 1,600 admissions. In other words, they were completely ignored by Lebanese audiences, and will most likely disappear from theaters within a couple of weeks. The fantastic <em><span><a href="http://ageeksblog.com/2014/03/15/movie-review-the-grand-budapest-hotel-2014/">Grand Budapest Hotel</a></span> </em>rounded out the top 10, adding 684 admissions for a total of 10,683 after 4 weeks.</span></p>
