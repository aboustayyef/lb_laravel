</p><div>I’m getting really tired of the anti-CGI circlejerk.</div>
<div>I wish the Internet’s irrational hatred for computer effects would stop. <em>Both</em> CGI and practical effects have their advantages and disadvantages. <em>Both</em> of them will look fake to a certain degree. That depends partly on the skill and efforts of the artists behind them—and let’s be clear: there is nothing “lazy” about CGI; just because it’s in a computer doesn’t mean it took less work—and partly on <em>personal preference</em>. Neither is objectively better than the other. That’s why modern movies use a combination of both.</div>
<div>Which brings me to my next wish: let’s please not overestimate the use of CGI in blockbuster movies, especially those with practical effects-reliant predecessors like the <em>Star Wars</em> prequels or the <em>Hobbit</em> trilogy. Contrary to popular belief, those films made heavy use of practical effects as well.</div>
<div>So, for example, let’s not hasten to assume that <em>Star Wars Episode VII</em> will use minimal CGI and feel like it was made in 1980, simply because we saw some puppets and practical sets in leaked pictures. <a href="http://www.slashfilm.com/star-wars-prequels-miniatures/">The prequels had those too.</a> And this is 2014.</div>

<p><strong><span>If you were to ask me which of Dreamworks’ films was the closest to something Pixar would make, my answer would resoundingly be 2010′s <em>How to Train Your Dragon.</em> With gorgeous art-direction, animation, and a heart-warming story about a boy and his dragon, it made for some incredible family entertainment, and opened the doors to a magical new world for us to further explore. <em>How to Train Your Dragon 2</em> is even better.</span></strong></p>
<p><span>The story takes place five years after the events of the first film. The Viking village of Berk is now a harmonious land where man and dragon live together in pure bliss. Hiccup (Jay Baruchel), who’s now 20 years old, spends most of his time with Toothless soaring high in the sky, discovering new lands. But things quickly take a turn for the worst when the pair discovers that a man called Drago Bludvist (Djimon Hounsou) is building a giant dragon army and is hell-bent on chaos and destruction. It’s up to our two heroes along with new and returning characters to put an end to his dangerous schemes. </span></p>

<p><span><em>How to Train Your Dragon 2 </em>does everything a great sequel should do. Instead of rehashing what happened last time, it expands the story and the world by taking us to new places and introducing us to great new characters. It’s also darker and more mature, which makes the consequences feel all the more dire and serious. There are some pretty heavy moments in the film, and I applaud director Dean DeBois for having the stones to go there. </span></p>
<p><span>The film’s art-direction is arguably the most beautiful I have ever seen in a 3D animated toon, and I’d urge everyone to shell-out the extra cash for 3D and premium formats. It really is worth it. DeBois takes full advantage of the fact that this is a movie about dragons, so we spend a lot of time between the clouds, and it’s incredible.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://ageeksblogdotcom1.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/1855714.jpg"><img src="http://ageeksblogdotcom1.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/1855714.jpg?w=650&h=432" alt="1855714"></a></p>
<p><span>What really makes the film work, though, is the relationship between Hiccup and Toothless. I love the fact that Toothless (and every other dragon) is basically a giant puppy, and he’s as adorable and lovable as ever. While their relationship does take a dark and complex turn this time around, it still absolutely works, which is a testament to the film’s amazing storytelling.  The voice work is also great, with the standouts being Gerard Butler as Hiccup’s dad, Stoik, and a Cate Blanchett as a new character that I won’t reveal here.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>The Verdict:</strong></span></p>
<p><span><em>How to Train Your Dragon 2 </em>is amazing entertainment that can literally appeal to anyone who enjoys great storytelling. It’s a brilliant sequel that isn’t afraid to take risks, and it’s one you definitely do not want to miss.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Numerical Score: 9/10</strong></span></p>

We didn’t need another serial killer cop drama, and we certainly didn’t need another incarnation of the tired Hannibal Lecter character. I almost didn’t watch <i>Hannibal</i> for those exact reasons. Thankfully I ignored my instincts and I’ve been blown away since its premiere over a year ago.</div><div><br></div><div>Many episodes of <i>Hannibal</i> I will probably never watch again. They are grotesque and complex and filled with some of the finest, nuanced acting I’ve had the pleasure to witness. (Hugh Dancy is particularly excellent at playing the maybe-he’s-crazy-but-not-really Will Graham.) I won’t watch some episodes again not because of the subject matter (which is gross) but because I can’t. Once is enough, more than, actually. I don’t want to have to go through the pain again. </div><div><br></div><div><i>Hannibal</i> is not an easy show to watch, even though it’s breathtaking in its honesty and earnestness. This show is so gorgeously shot that instead of commenting on the human beehives or the human violin, I keep thinking, “Wow, look at that composition! And that creepy music! How gorgeous!” I mean, that’s not a normal reaction when looking at these horrific images. I almost feel creepy admiring it all. </div><div><br></div><div>Since I didn’t get to review each episode individually, and honestly, the season worked better – and made more sense – if you think of it as one long installment, I’ve written about my ten favorite tastiest moments below. This shouldn’t have to be said, but: spoilers, obviously. (These are in no particular order; just as they popped into my head.)</div><div><br></div><div><b>1. Jack and Hannibal Fight</b></div><div>Season two started off in the best possible way: With a huge fight between Jack and Hannibal. No words are exchanged between the two as the audience waits with bated breath to find out how our characters ended up here.  As we’re wondering what lead to this showdown, the brutal fight is over almost as quickly as it begins. We leave on Jack bleeding profusely in the pantry as the scene fades to black with the caption “TWELVE WEEKS EARLIER.” The episode then goes back in time as we work our way toward the events leading up to the fight.</div><div><br></div><div><b>2. Beverly Katz’s Death</b></div><div>Beverly Katz, a small player in season one, takes on a meatier role in season two. Unfortunately, she got too close to the truth and Hannibal had to take her out. She didn’t deserve the death she got, especially as Hannibal slices her up deli meat style and displays her like a piece of art. </div><div><br></div><div><b>3. Hannibal Has Abel Gideon Eat His Own Leg</b></div><div>Hannibal abducts Gideon from the mental hospital Will is in, amputates Gideon’s leg, cooks it in clay, and makes Gideon eat it. He <b>LITERALLY</b> put his foot in his mouth. The best part: How calm and collected Hannibal is during this entire plot. Mads Mikkelsen is SO good and SO creepy and yet I want him to give me a hug and feed me a gorgeous looking meal? Like, what are these feelings?</div><div><br></div><div><b>4. Face Off </b></div><div>In the book, Mason Verger was a lot worse than in the series. But, their fates are basically the same. Hannibal injects him with some mind altering – but not debilitating – drugs and takes him to Will’s house. When Will walks in he finds Mason feeding his face to Will’s dogs. Yes. You read that right. But, to make things even worse – and even MORE disturbing – Hannibal tells Mason to eat his nose. What does Mason do? He EATS HIS NOSE. WHAT IS THIS SHOW YOU GUYS! </div><div><br></div><div><b>5. Miriam Lass Returns</b></div><div>Last we saw Miriam, Jack’s FBI cadet/protégé, she found out the truth about Hannibal so he cut off her arm and teased Jack with it. When Jack finds her in a season two episode, she only wants to find the Ripper. During the years Hannibal held her hostage, he did some sort of brainwash on her that led her to finger Frederick Chilton as that of the Ripper. When she sees Chilton being interrogated, she grabs Jack’s gun and SHOOTS CHILTON IN THE FACE! </div><div><br></div><div><b>6. Horse…Woman…Bird</b></div><div>Once the season arc was established, “Hannibal” had a few “killer of the week” episodes. None were as demented as the eighth episode, “Su-zakana.” Will and Jack find a woman dead inside of a dead horse. When on the autopsy table the woman “births” a bird, which later dies. But you guys, there’s one point where, like, a guy gets sewn into another horse and ohmygosh how twisted was that whole episode???!??!!?</div><div><br></div><div><b>7. Human Color Wheel</b></div><div>Imagine, if you will, waking up from a drug induced stupor (not self-induced, mind you) and finding out you’re sewn to a bunch of other dead people. Like, your body is covered in this disgusting glue which had melted your skin into that of another person’s skin. Disgusting. The worst part is living through that and escaping, only to die by falling off a cliff. The first serial killer we see of the season created a human color wheel, with each victim’s skin darker than the last. Less you think the guy gets away with it, Hannibal conveniently adds him to the color wheel, thus completing the palette. </div><div><br></div><div><b>8. Dr. DuMarier Makes A Confession</b></div><div>Hannibal framed Will at the end of season one so he spends the first part of season two in jail. Few still believe his innocence, while the rest try to get one with their lives confident the Chesapeake Ripper is behind bars. Dr. Bedelia DuMaurier (the sublime Gillian Anderson) is about to leave town because she knows the truth about Hannibal and wants to keep the truth – and her life – safe. Before leaving, however, she visits Will in prison and breathlessly whispers three words Will needed to hear: “I believe you.” Those words finally convinced Will that he was right all along: Hannibal is the Ripper. </div><div><br></div><div><b>9. Bella Tries To Commit Suicide</b></div><div>Gina Torres returned as Bella, Jack’s cancer stricken wife. She’s in so much pain she consumes a bunch of pain medicine for an easy way out. In a rare moment of humanity, Hannibal flips a coin which decides Bella’s fate. He decides to save her, much against her wishes. That in and of itself isn’t a particular uplifting moment, especially since Hannibal saves her because he’s not ready for her to die, but the slap she gives Hannibal was one of the most satisfying things all season. </div><div><br></div><div><b>10. Every Single Moment From the Finale</b></div><div>If you haven’t seen <b>Mizumono</b>, the season two finale, stop reading and do so now. It’s quite possibly one of the most beautifully crafted pieces of fiction you’ll see all year. Every single character’s life hangs in the balance as Hannibal manages once again to weasel his way out of the FBI’s reach. All of the events of season two have led us back to Jack and Hannibal’s fight in the kitchen, and what a superb piece of action that was. Alana Bloom shows up and Abigail (yes! Abigail) pushes her out of a second story window. Will shows up and gets stabbed multiple times in the stomach. Hannibal leaves all three characters lying in their own blood while Hannibal sips mimosas on a plane to Paris. How the hell are you going to end there, <i>Hannibal</i>? Can you imagine how you would have reacted if this show had not been renewed? Thankfully we will see the effects of Hannibal’s carnage when season three returns next winter. </div></div>";s:17:"post_image_height";i:506;s:16:"post_image_width";i:760;s:11:"post_visits";i:1;s:18:"post_twitterShares";i:2;s:19:"post_facebookShares";i:6;s:16:"post_totalShares";i:8;s:16:"post_socialScore";i:10;s:13:"post_virality";i:17;s:9:"blog_name";s:13:"Nad's Reviews";s:16:"blog_description";s:72:"Nad's Reviews specializes in TV reviews as well as films and restaurants";s:8:"blog_url";s:27:"http://www.nadsreviews.com/";s:11:"blog_author";s:3:"Nad";s:28:"blog_author_twitter_username";s:11:"NadsReviews";s:13:"blog_rss_feed";s:54:"http://www.nadsreviews.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss";s:9:"blog_tags";s:18:"tv, culture, media";s:2:"id";i:162;s:11:"blog_active";i:1;s:24:"blog_last_post_timestamp";i:1402656420;}i:6;O:8:"stdClass":26:{s:7:"post_id";i:31153;s:8:"post_url";s:75:"http://sillygoon.com/2014/06/12/neon-indian-next-up-in-our-chillwave-vibes/";s:10:"post_title";s:43:"Neon Indian, next up in our chillwave vibes";s:10:"post_image";s:61:"http://sillygoon.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/neon-indian5.jpg";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:123:"Next up in our chillwave vibes is Neon Indian.

Your host? Seth MacFarlane, the genius behind “Family Guy” and the hilarious “Ted”. “A Million Ways” is MacFarlane’s take on the Western genre, with plenty of sex jokes and gross out gags to inspire haters. Fair enough. But for all its ups and downs, the movie has some funny moments. Start with MacFarlane himself (in his first acting role), who plays a modest sheep farmer whose girlfriend (Amanda Seyfried) just dumped him for a douche (Neil Patrick Harris). Then our man falls for Anna (Charlize Theron), but she’s married to a ruthless killer Clinch Leatherwood, played by Liam Neeson. A lot of things happen in between, and it doesn’t always make sense. MacFarlane’s production team has provided beautiful sets, locations, and music as a backdrop for his Western spoof, and it’s all very impressive But I wish the movie itself was more memorable. There are good moments here and there, and a strong cast including Giovanni Ribisi and Sarah Silverman. With all that talent involved, it’s a shame this isn’t a better film.</p>

<p><span><strong>It’s safe to say that a lot of sequels fail to live up to their predecessors. Things can start getting repetitive, and what was once new and fresh becomes old and stale. Comedy sequels in particular seem to have a hard time with that. 2012′s <em>21 Jump Street</em> was an extremely pleasant surprise, courtesy of directors Christopher Miller and Phil Lord. It was clever and full of energy, and boasted some brotastic chemistry between Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum. <em>22 Jump Street</em> is every bit as good as the original, if not better. The film is so meta and self-aware, not to mention hilarious, that whatever does feel familiar or recycled is completely forgiven because of the film’s willingness to poke fun at itself, and make us laugh countless times in the process.</strong></span></p>
<p><span>When Ice Cube’s character, Captain Dickson, eloquently told officers Schmidt (Jonah Hill) and Jenko (Channing Tatum) “You two sons of bitches are going to college,” he wasn’t kidding. When Schmidt and Jenko are assigned to stop a new drug from spreading out of a local university, things get a little crazy. Struggling to balance the investigation, new friendships, and their partnership, our two unlikely heroes are tested like never before. In other words, shit gets crazy.</span></p>

<p><span> I seriously think Chris Miller and Phil Lord can do no wrong. Those guys are on a roll, and I don’t see them slowing down any time soon. The way they’ve circumvented the inherent repetitiveness of sequels is to completely embrace the fact that it’s a sequel by constantly winking (figuratively) at the audience. If you thought the first film was meta, you have no idea what you’re in for. But seriously, those guys understand what funny is, and this movie is hilarious from start to finish.</span></p>
<p><span>Great writing and directing means nothing without great leads, and Hill and Tatum are back and better than ever. <em>21 Jump Street</em> was the movie that made me like Channing Tatum, and I like him even more after the sequel. He’s really maturing as an actor, and I’m glad that it took a great comedic role to get him to break out. Jonah Hill is as lovable as ever, and the pair’s chemistry is ultimately the film’s heart. Who can forget Ice Cube, who’s a scene-stealer as Captain Dickson, or Nick Offerman, who once again manages to get tons of laughs in just one brief scene.</span></p>

<p><span><strong>The Verdict:</strong></span></p>
<p><span>Chris Miller and Phil Lord have done it again. <em>22 Jump Street</em> is an wonderfully crafted sequel that embraces what it is and gives us more of what we loved the first time around: hilarious jokes, <span>great acting</span>, and a big, gooey heart. It’s the year’s best comedy so far (sorry <a href="http://ageeksblog.com/2014/04/17/movie-review-neighbors-2014/"><em>N</em><em>eighbors</em></a>), and you’d be a fool to miss it.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Numerical Score: 9.5/10</strong></span></p>

<p>There are different points in our lives where we go back to playing those Beatles records and remember why they will always be the biggest band of all time. From the early 60′s silly love songs, to the genius of Abbey Road, the Beatles discography is a perfect cross-generational artwork.</p>
<p>Since the Beatles are not on Spotify, and since no one buys anything on iTunes anymore, many YouTube users were kind enough to upload every Beatles album, many times over. And since Revolver’s unofficial motto is “Sit back, relax, and enjoy music for free”, we decided to make things easier for you and compile a playlist of all Beatles studio albums in chronological order.</p>
<p>If you were never a Beatles fan, here’s your chance to catch up on music history. As for true Beatles fans, we know you’d appreciate this even if you own all their vinyls.</p>

It’s rare to find a mainstream <span>American movie</span> that doesn’t rely on formula to some degree. That’s one of the many reasons this movie is so refreshing: we haven’t encountered these characters before, and yet we find ourselves rooting for them from the word go. What’s more, Boone has cast his film so well, that actors we thought we knew deliver eye-opening performances. I like Ansel Elgort, but I never suspected he had what it takes to play a character like Augustus Waters, a confident boy who has lost a leg to cancer but hasn’t allowed it to ruin his life. He is a revelation, bringing to life a difficult character whose intensity is frightening at times. It’s his pursuit of “positivity,” always looking at the bright side, that gives the movie its heartbeat. I’ve also been impressed with Shailene Woodley and I’ve said it so many times before (if you haven’t seen her in “The Spectacular Now” get on it), but she manages to top herself with this performance, playing a 16 year old cancer patient who meets Augustus at a support group meeting. She and him relate to each other for unlikely reasons, but their connection is strong and credible. Her character is smart, funny, seemingly fearless, and ultimately heartbreaking. I don’t know what other 22-year old actress could have pulled this off, but she is terrific. And yet I have to admit: I didn’t know what to anticipate from “The Fault In Our Stars”, but I couldn’t have foreseen such a sincere, emotionally powerful story. How director Josh Boone and his youthful stars achieved such seemingly effortless honesty, is hard to say but easy to admire. Best of all, he has the good sense to let the camera stay close to Woodley as her face reflects what words cannot. Woodley is a marvel. The audience couldn’t get enough of her. You won’t, either. Her performance grabs hold and won’t let go. Same goes for the movie.

Snow</span></b></span></div><div>If you thought last week’s episode was epic, then this week’s must have blown your minds because it definitely did mine. Not only was it the best episode from a directing and production aspect, the writing and acting were beyond excellent. </div><div><br></div><div>The episode was dedicated to one location, The Wall, and was filled with amazing moments between characters and the most beautifully directed battle sequences. We take for granted how many locations we normally visit in one hour of <i>Game of Thrones,</i> and to be honest I find it refreshing when some episodes like this one (and <b>The Battle of Blackwater Bay</b> in season two) focus on one location and the characters who inhabit it. The writers are able to remind us that many of the inhabitants are characters we love. </div><div><br></div><div>I give such high props to the fight choreographers, and stunt team because this episode was heavy with casualties and battle techniques. It reminded me of The Battle of Helm’s Deep in <i>The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers.</i> The good are outnumbered by the bad yet stand true and hold the wall. </div><div><br></div><div>I was excited to see Jon finally back to his badass self and it was great to see him take charge. Sacrifices were many in this episode as <i>Game of Thrones</i> begins to further steer away from the books by killing off two characters that apparently are still alive in the books.</div><div><br></div><div>There were several cheer-worthy moments in the episde as certain Wildlings were killed off. I was truly beyond impressed with this episode and I feel it will go down as the best battle episode to date. </div><div><br></div><div><span><b>Slices of Westeros</b></span></div><div><br></div><div>- Giants and Mammoths and Wildlings … oh my!</div><div><br></div><div>- The battle strategies that the Night’s Watch use to defend Castle Black.</div><div><br></div><div>- A 360-degree long lake around Castle Black.

<p><strong><span>With two high-profile releases making their way to Lebanese theaters this weekend, it seemed as though </span><span><em><a href="http://ageeksblog.com/2014/06/02/movie-review-maleficent-2014/">Maleficent</a></em> <span>would have a hard time holding on to the top spot. Well, it looks Tom Cruise and Toothless were no match for Angelina Jolie. The film dropped by a shockingly slim 18% from last weekend to 13,825 admissions. In other words, <em>Maleficent’s </em>second weekend at the box office is still bigger than <em>X-Men: Days of Future Past’s</em> opening. That’s quite impressive. The film has already broken through the 30K mark and has sold 36,482 tickets; a fantastic result.</span> </span></strong></p>
<p><span>Tom Cruise’s latest sci-fi adventure,</span> <em><a href="http://ageeksblog.com/2014/06/04/movie-review-edge-of-tomorrow-2014/">Edge of Tomorrow</a>,</em><span> opened in second place with pretty solid results. The film attracted 11,068 moviegoers in its opening weekend, which is pretty strong for a film based on relatively obscure source material. You can thank Tom Cruise’s global star appeal for that opening, </span></p>
<p><span>Third place went to</span> <em><a href="http://tlkabtmovies.com/2014/06/06/how-to-train-your-dragon-2-2014/">How to Train Your Dragon 2</a>, </em><span>which opened to pretty dismal numbers. Dreamworks’ latest animated tale sold a measly 5,070 tickets. To put that figure in perspective, <em><span>Mr. Peabody </span><span>&</span></em><span><em> Sherman </em>opened with 7,138 admissions. That movie wasn’t a sequel and was based on a cartoon show most kids today have never even heard of. For <em>Dragon </em>to open to such weak numbers doesn’t bode well for the film in the coming weeks. Hopefully with kids getting out of school, things should pick up a bit, but it’s certainly a disappointing start.</span></span></p>
<p><em><span><a href="http://ageeksblog.com/2014/05/21/movie-review-x-men-days-of-future-past-2014/">X-Men: Days of Future Past</a> </span></em><span><span>dropped to fourth place with 4,321 admissions. It cracked the 30K mark and raised its total to 30,598.</span> <em><span><a href="http://ageeksblog.com/2014/04/17/movie-review-neighbors-2014/">Neighbors</a></span></em> <span>actually managed to move up a spot, and weaseled its way back in the top five with 1,956 admissions for a new total of 29,201 after five weeks in theaters.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Other notable results this week include Seth MacFarlane’s <em><span><a href="http://ageeksblog.com/2014/05/30/movie-review-a-million-ways-to-die-in-the-west-2014/">A Million Ways to Die in the West</a></span></em><span> dropping to eighth place after only two weeks in theaters. The film dropped by around 46% to 1,723 admissions and a disappointing total of 6,481. </span></span></span><em><a href="http://tlkabtmovies.com/2014/06/04/the-angriest-man-in-brooklyn-2014/">The Angriest Man in Brooklyn</a> </em><span>totally flopped and landed in tenth place with 1,562 admissions. Nothing too surprising there.</span></p>
