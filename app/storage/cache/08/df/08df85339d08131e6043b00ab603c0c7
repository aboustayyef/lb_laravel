<p>The word “falatan” or social mess/chaos has many meanings and can be measured differently according to each society and its traditions. Having sex before marriage for example is not a chaos in Europe, thus a non-virgin European girl can never be considered as a whore regardless of agreeing with the fact or not. Everyone is free in his own life as long as he is not disturbing others’.</p>
<p>Moreover, generalizing a situation taking place in one resort on all resorts is totally unacceptable. Telling that lack of ethics is occurring in Lebanese swimming pools means that most of them to not say all are full of perversity, which is certainly not the case.</p>

<p>Below are some of the article’s points I totally disagree with and consider as views’ imposition.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Athena is full of prostitution and immorality:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So everyone in Athena is either a streetwalker or a pimp?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mykonos is the uncontrolled capital of gays:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Regardless of being homosexuals not gays, what is surveillance needed for?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nudist beaches and nobody cares:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Why should anybody care? A person opposing such places is free to avoid them.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pool or Cabaret:</p>
</blockquote>
<ul><li>Dancing on the bar while wearing a swimwear is totally normal when on the beach. Many people are avoiding such places since this fact is bothering them and contradicting with their habits, which is totally normal. Every person should respect others’ rules in addition to having his own rules that should be respected.</li>
<li>Many resorts in Lebanon have free entrance for girls before 11:00 or 12:00 due to the bad touristic movement. They are sacrificing access fees with the hope of having more people inside to spend money on food and drinks.</li>
<li>The pool in the article’s photo is 18+ and no kids are allowed inside. Therefore, no harm in children’s education.</li>
</ul><blockquote><p>Porn film – Kissing in the pool before ending up in the bed:</p></blockquote>
<p>I am not willing to comment on this point, mostly that I think having sex in public couldn’t take place in Lebanon without arresting both parties.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>P.S.: I am not defending the resort which I think most of us recognized it and I totally agree that morals and ethics should be respected, particularly in public places, but limiting others’ freedom just because you disagree with and generalizing a case as if all resorts in Lebanon are full of prostitution is inadmissible.</p>

However, I chose to rename it for the purpose of fairness and giving credit where credit was due, since I managed to squeeze in two rides on the same afternoon/evening with two very different experiences.</p>
<p>Some of you who follow me on Twitter might have noticed that I immediately reached out to <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/tech-ticker/~https://twitter.com/Uber_Beirut" target="_blank">Uber Beirut</a> upon news of their launch. I am a big fan of the hailing app concept and have had the chance to try several apps in several countries starting with Romania.</p>
<p>Uber however is not just any app, and regardless of any controversy that you might have heard, these guys have an excellent business model that is spreading like wildfire and I can totally understand why:
<br>
What’s not to like about the promise of ordering a timely, elegant transport with a courteous driver and a friction-less payment method from the comfort of your smartphone?</p>
<h3>My First Ride in Beirut…Uber-Lebanese</h3>
<p>I set out heading from Badaro to LAU Beirut on Saturday (2014-07-12), and placed my order at 18:53. Surely enough, I was notified that the driver would be arriving within 4 minutes. So far so good, but 4 minutes later with no car in sight, I followed up with a short text to the driver indicating exactly where I would wait for him, to avoid any confusion.
<br>
From there on, things went downhill. It took the driver 32 minutes to reach me. I was seriously panicking that I would not be able to make it on time to LAU.</p>
<p><img src="http://i2.wp.com/tech-ticker.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Uber-Driver-Combo.jpg?resize=894%2C800" alt="Uber-Driver-Combo" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<p>I called the driver to inquire how close he was as the car seemed lost in a maze of streets in Achrafieh. He assured me he was close to the museum but what I was seeing in front of me suggested something else. I then finally spotted him coming towards me but stopping to ask for direction, so I called him again. He saw me also and hung up as he pulled up.</p>
<div>As you see from the info above, I was off to a bad start, and had less than 30 minutes to get to my destination. Doors were to close at 19:45 at LAU. As I got into the car I was surprised again that the driver was not familiar with the area and did not know how to make up for lost time to make it there, so I co-piloted and navigated him through my usual road.</div>
<div></div>
<div>I must, however, in all due conscience, say that he seemed really apologetic and stressed that he had been so late and he was really helpful and courteous through the ride, adjusting the cooling and proposing me a drink of water since he saw I had been sweltering in the heat for 30 minutes. He also did his best to get me to my destination on time. I eventually made it on time  and got off just 15 meters away from the lower gate although he proposed to drive me exactly there. I did not want us to get caught in the Koraytem road maze.</div>
<div></div>
<div>I was left perplex on what to make of this experience. On one hand, I had waited in the heat for half an hour and lost my chance for a decent seating at the event, on the other, the vehicle and the driver were up to my expectation in terms of quality and behavior.</div>
<div>I still do not want to categorically draw any conclusions and perhaps traffic was hard on the way to Badaro from Abdel Wahab Street although on a Saturday afternoon in summer, Beirut is usually traffic free.</div>
<h3>Uber Redeemed by Abbas</h3>
<div>After the ceremony in LAU had finished, we decided to grab a bite at the nearby Deek Duke restaurant (<a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/tech-ticker/~https://www.google.com/maps/place/Deek+Duke/@33.895934,35.479451,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0x1f523092cb1590e" target="_blank">Google Map</a>). I wanted to try again taking Uber. My girlfriend had ordered a ride a few hours before me that day and was extremely satisfied. So I opened the app, GPS blasting, and placed an order. A car was assigned to us a few minutes away. I then monitor the driver skillfully avoiding congested roads to make it on time and arriving at the marker that was supposed to represent our location.</div>
<div></div>
<div>However, as we look around, there was no car anywhere near.</div>
<div>I immediately call the driver, and we quickly realize the app had placed us in Bliss not in Hamra. I bare a lot of the responsibility this time as I did not really zoom in and look at the pin.
<br>
However, he reassured me he had understood where we actually were, and sure enough, a few minutes later a sparkling new BMW Series 5 pulls up.</div>
<div><img src="http://i0.wp.com/tech-ticker.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Uber-Abbas.png?resize=720%2C1280" alt="Uber Abbas" data-recalc-dims="1"></div>
<div>A neatly dressed driver disembarks, introduces himself as Abbas, opening the door for us. <span>Once in the car, he apologizes once more (although he was not to blame for a faulty GPS location in the app) and asks if the air conditioning setting was to our liking and we were comfortably seated. The rest of our drive home was smooth as can be and upon our arrival we got the same royal treatment as when we boarded the vehicle.</span></div>
<h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
<p>Sure, some of you will say I am being tough on the first driver and the company, and that a normal Taxi will have lied and weaseled its way out of this, and even not shown up at all.
<br>
But you know what? This is NOT a random taxi company managed by some fat-bellied, sweat-dripping, flip-flop wearing driver. I based my expectations on the reputation of what is the fastest growing company in this field. Just consider this: <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/tech-ticker/~www.forbes.com/sites/stevenbertoni/2014/05/22/surge-pricing-uber-seeking-12-billion-valuation-in-latest-funding-round/" target="_blank">Uber had recently been seeking $12 Billion valuation in its latest funding round</a></p>
<p>In the entire commotion I had not noticed that I had received a mail follow up. Uber had reacted to the rating of the first drive that I had input on the app even before I got to write this blog post and reacted by giving me a 5$ coupon on the spot. I think this is just one facet of how professional these people are. I also think the driver which I had the unfortunate experience with, has the potential of being an excellent driver as he gets more used to the roads and the process as a whole.</p>
<p>Uber did warn us this was a sort of a “beta” release. Therefore, I will cut them some slack in that area but above all I will thank them for one of the best rides home I have had in a very long time.</p>
<p>Regular Lebanese taxi providers are still in a slumber, but they better wake up really fast and get up to speed with the century. They are about to be heavily outclassed and I honestly do not think they can do anything about it, especially those among them with new fleets and cocky attitudes.</p>

But unfortunately, far too many apartments and even so-called villas of our day and age fit the caveman ticket at least in their exteriors. Cities today, just like the past 100 years have the flair of stacked caves that are crowded into buildings are deficient of character. They are structures built from primitive design or shortsighted greed, or both. Consequently, millions of buildings in thousands of cities are only theoretically conducive of social life and economic activity, lacking structural character that would support their owners and tenants in improving their lives.</p>
<p>Beirut also is stacked with buildings that create feelings ranging from distance to disgust, whether as fancy but wholly unimaginative towers or as barely functional boxes used for commerce, housing, leisure or education. But that is not the whole truth. There is not only a small and dwindling portfolio of heritage buildings that help the city to breathe civilization, there is also a small but growing stock of new buildings that represent ingenuity and some that even make us think — and perhaps help us think more constructively.</p>
<p>When Executive last month surveyed one such building, the new home of the Issam Fares Institute think tank on the grounds of the American University of Beirut, IFI director Rami Khouri said that the new building had immediately boosted his team’s ability “to do better work.” Part of this was due to the structure’s information and communications technology features and the high visibility that the building provided. But another part of the productivity gains derives from the building’s design and the conducive environment that it generates, Khouri said, inspiring staffers to conduct their “core activities with much greater enthusiasm.”</p>
<p>With a tip of the hat to the project owners, architects and developers that have invested themselves in unconventional projects, Executive has put together a selection of recently completed buildings that impress us as concepts, and which give us something to think about. Some may even be seen as entrenched, positive elements of the city’s fabric in 100 years time.</p>
