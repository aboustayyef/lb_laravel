Though partially deaf, Pierre Geagea, 34, expresses himself not through speech, but through his Mother Tongue - sign language - and contemporary dance.
  
  Born deaf, Pierre was unable to hear or speak until his mid-teens when, with the help of speech therapy and a huge amount of personal effort, he gradually developed the capacity to read lips. 
  
  In the show, Pierre performs on an almost completely bare stage using simple props, including a chair, a table and an aerial silk hammock. At times, a single spotlight dangles from the ceiling, highlighting Geagea's muscular curves and curly hair.
  
  There’s a spontaneous quality to Pierre’s work that translates beautifully into his artistic vision. “I don’t exactly think in terms of choreography. What I care about the most is [how] to integrate sign language and dance in my work,” he said. 
  
  
  
  Assistant Director Sara Maurice describes the show as a culmination of the dancer's own life experiences and development. “This was a show done by Pierre in May and now it’s coming back to the stage. They’ve worked on it a lot more so now it’s like taken to a new level. Pierre interacts with the music, the music interacts with him, and this definitely gives a certain mood to the piece,” she said. 
  
  Mother Tongue features live music from Sharif Sehnaoui and Tony Elieh, pioneer musicians on the Lebanese experimental music scene. The duo worked closely with Pierre to find a harmonious music-movement connection for the performance.
  
  With a childlike smile, Pierre says he was first inspired to dance by Michael Jackson and only became more serious about the effort after he began training at the age of 14 in different dance genres ranging from ballet and jazz to traditional dabkeh. “When I was around 10, I didn’t know much about dance but I used to love Michael Jackson,” he told Beirut.com. Later, turning his talent and passion to contemporary dance, he gradually formed his own distinct means of expression in a style that was further polished by choreographers from prominent Lebanese dance companies such as Caracalla, Arabesque and the Takween Collective. He also recounted his journey in France with La Mission de La Danse which has a special place in his heart. 
  
  Director Nadim Deaibes first worked with Pierre 13-years-ago in a show that became one of the first in Beirut to blend sign language and visual performance. “We got together again last year when I came back from France after assistant choreographer Daniel Balabane told me Pierre was putting on a new show,” Nadim explained. “Pierre came up with the concept and choreography, what we provided was an overall outside look on his existing work in order to pull all the different parts together."
  
  Nadim also made a precious observation about the major challenge of this production: achieving effective communication. Since Pierre primarily relies on lip reading,  this sort of pushed everyone on the team to make themselves clear while communicating. It was a challenge, but it made the group stronger as a whole.
  
  Pierre hopes shows like Mother Tongue will get more people involved in the deaf community in Lebanon and hopes one day the Ministry of Culture will take the initiative to implement effective learning opportunities for people with special needs.
  
  The 45-minute show opens tomorrow at Monnot Theater and is set to run until July 20. Tickets are on sale at all branches of Librairie Antoine and through Antoine Online.

The Yoga Tablet 10 HD+ looks almost exactly like its predecessor, building on its unique form factor and physical features, most notable which is the Kickstand and that cylindrical bulge on its side.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Build & Design</h2>
<p>The tablet has an exceptionally slim aluminium body (10.28 x 7.09 x 0.32 in. or 261 x 180 x 8.1 mm) has its center of gravity shifted toward its edge where a large cylindrical bulge lies. This part holds the kickstand as well as a battery, which we praised heavily on the previous model as it offers an impressive 9000 mAh of power.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.absolutegeeks.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Lenovo-Yoga-Tablet-10-HD-6-e1405620565875.jpg" rel="lightbox-0"><img src="http://www.absolutegeeks.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Lenovo-Yoga-Tablet-10-HD-6-1024x576.jpg" alt="Lenovo Yoga Tablet 10 HD (6)" width="838" height="471"></a></p>
<p>The body has been fully crafted out of magnesium alloy, which combined with a smooth front glass surface leaves the impression of a premium device — right off the bat, anyone can see that the Yoga Tablet 10 HD+ is not your average tablet. The elegant side line with slightly rounded edges also contributes to the pleasurable feeling while using it.</p>
<p>This device comes in at 1.4 pounds (615 grams). Due to the shifted center of gravity it does not tire out the hand for the most part, we found that the 10″ version does get somewhat heavy on the wrist over a prolonged duration, something not felt in its 8″ older smaller and lighter sibling.</p>

<p>The most notable and unique feature of the Yoga 10 HD+ is the kickstand and cylindrical bulge on the side. This allows for two functionalities/features that make the tablet stand out from the competition: The battery (addressed later in the review), and the kickstand.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>The Kickstand</h2>
<p>Lenovo has always been a market leader in producing devices that can perform in versatile ways. It’s Yoga family of products are testament to that positioning. The Yoga tablet is no different. The Kickstand allows the tablet to be rested in a number of ways without the need to add a cover or accessories to achieve this.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.absolutegeeks.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Lenovo-Yoga-Tablet-10-HD-11-e1405620707745.jpg" rel="lightbox-2"><img src="http://www.absolutegeeks.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Lenovo-Yoga-Tablet-10-HD-11-1024x677.jpg" alt="Lenovo Yoga Tablet 10 HD (11)" width="838" height="554"></a></p>
<p>This allows for three usage modes: the Hold, Tilt and Stand.  In Hold mode, the weight of the device falls into your palm rather than your fingers, making it more comfortable for reading and browsing.  Lay it down into Tilt mode and you have a perfect viewing angle for typing or gaming. Flick the kickstand and rest it upright in Stand mode to comfortably watch videos, listen to music, or video-chat.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Display</h2>
<p>The most immediately evident change to the upgraded Lenovo Yoga Tablet 10 is the increase of the screen resolution. Instead of a mere 1280 x 800 pixels, this tablet now has Full HD resolution, i.e. 1920 x 1200 pixels, increasing pixel density from a humble 149 ppi to a more pleasant 224 ppi. From a usual distance, individual pixels can no longer be spotted with the naked eye, and displayed items do not seem even slightly blurred, as the case was with the first Yoga Tablet 10.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.absolutegeeks.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Lenovo-Yoga-Tablet-10-HD-9-e1405620850991.jpg" rel="lightbox-6"><img src="http://www.absolutegeeks.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Lenovo-Yoga-Tablet-10-HD-9-1024x801.jpg" alt="Lenovo Yoga Tablet 10 HD (9)" width="838" height="655"></a></p>
<p>The contrast has also been improved, so it is now above average for a mid-range tablet. Black tones are now exceptionally dark, but the white tones could be a bit less ‘dirty’, i.e. lighter. The colors are realistically interpreted and quite vivid, yet not overly saturated, which can often be the case (and which many users actually like) with more advanced tablets. However, contrast sustainability still has certain shortcomings, especially when the display is exposed to direct sunlight, while the viewing angle is satisfactory and relatively wide.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.absolutegeeks.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Yoga-10HD-3D-Gaming-Screenshot-2.jpg" rel="lightbox-7"><img src="http://www.absolutegeeks.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Yoga-10HD-3D-Gaming-Screenshot-2-1024x640.jpg" alt="Yoga 10HD 3D Gaming Screenshot 2" width="838" height="523"></a></p>
<p>Thanks to a new active ambient lighting sensor, automatic display brightness adjustment has more balance than the previous Yoga Tablet 10 featured. We found that the brightness adjustment is sometimes not subtle enough with fast and large dips or spikes in brightness (delayed optimization) depending on the ambient light.</p>
<p>All in all, the display offers an experience similar to that of premium Android tablets, and it is one of the best of the mid-range 10-inch devices.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Software</h2>
<p>Not much is different here from Lenovo’s other tablets and smartphones. Lenovo does seem to start building up its own ecosystem of apps and services that compliment its range of products. With built-in apps like SHAREit, SYNCit HD and SECUREit HD.</p>
<p>SHAREit provides file sharing on multiple devices (tablet, smartphone and PC), it’s Lenovo’s version of Apple’s Airdrop. The process gets a bit long when sharing with devices that don’t have SHAREit installed, but it’s still great because, unlike Airdrop, it does share with multiple platforms (Mac, PC, Android).</p>

<p>SYNCit allows you to sync your preferences and contacts with the cloud, easily retrieving them later on your new Lenovo device or laptop. To us, this is a bit redundant since Google Contacts provides the same functionality and is far more and better connected with Google’s other products.</p>
<p>The tablet also makes use of its 10″ real-estate by enabling a multi-window mode, allowing you to work on two apps at the same time.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Sound and Battery</h2>
<p>Both deserve to be mentioned, but not big enough for their separate sections.</p>
<p>The Yoga Tablet 10 HD+ comes with a Dolby enhanced front speakers, giving deeper and more immersive sounds to your music and videos. The nice thing about this Dolby system, which has its own control panel, is that it is fully customizable and could be changed to accommodate the mode you’re using the tablet in (Hold, Tilt, Stand), all at a flick of a switch.</p>
<p>The battery is nothing short of outstanding. It’s safe to say that we’ve never experienced a battery that lasts this long on any device we’ve tested, ever! At the time of writing this review we logged 7 days and 5 hours of usage on the battery with 23% still left to go! Need we say more!</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Performance</h2>
<p>Let’s get some numbers and key specs out of the way. The Yoga Tablet 10 HD+ sports a Qualcomm Snapdragon 400 quad code 1.6GHz and a 2GB RAM. The unit we reviewed had 16GB of storage space, expandable via SD card slot. The tablet also supports SIM cards for cellular data connection.</p>

<p>The tablet scored 19363 on AnTuTu Benchmark test. Not too bad, but not as much as we’d hoped for it. It does fit well in its mid-range tablet category though, providing a smooth and streamlined experience throughout. We haven’t experienced any lagging or drop in performance even while running multiple apps in multi-screen mode. 3D games performed smoothly as well, but the quality of the graphics suffered a little as the game optimized its rendering to fit the processor’s capacity.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Wrap up</h2>
<p>The Lenovo Yoga Tablet 10 HD+ is a well rounded tablet that delivers a lot more than what you pay for. At AED 1,499, it’s pretty much a steal. The tablet doesn’t exactly compete with the heavyweights out there like Samsung’s Pro tablet range and Apple’s iPads, but it’s not supposed to do so in the first place.</p>
<p>This is a mid-range tablet that is built to address all of an average users needs, delivering them in both style and decent power. The enhanced display resolution is a plus from last year’s model and the battery life is simply unparalleled.</p>
<p>If you’re looking for an affordable, mid-range tablet that has a quality build, versatile viewing modes, enhanced Dolby sound system and a killer battery, the Lenovo Yoga Tablet 10 HD+ is definitely the tablet of choice for you.</p>";s:17:"post_image_height";i:576;s:16:"post_image_width";i:1024;s:11:"post_visits";i:3;s:18:"post_twitterShares";i:9;s:19:"post_facebookShares";i:131;s:16:"post_totalShares";i:140;s:16:"post_socialScore";i:23;s:13:"post_virality";i:40;s:9:"blog_name";s:14:"Absolute Geeks";s:16:"blog_description";s:28:"Unleash The Tech Geek In You";s:8:"blog_url";s:24:"http://absolutegeeks.com";s:11:"blog_author";s:0:"";s:28:"blog_author_twitter_username";s:13:"absolutegeeks";s:13:"blog_rss_feed";s:34:"http://www.absolutegeeks.com/feed/";s:9:"blog_tags";s:4:"tech";s:2:"id";i:268;s:11:"blog_active";i:1;s:24:"blog_last_post_timestamp";i:1405622580;s:6:"col_id";N;s:8:"col_name";N;s:16:"col_media_source";N;s:13:"col_home_page";N;s:13:"col_shorthand";N;s:26:"col_media_source_shorthand";N;s:27:"col_author_twitter_username";N;s:8:"col_tags";N;s:15:"col_description";N;s:23:"col_last_post_timestamp";N;}}
