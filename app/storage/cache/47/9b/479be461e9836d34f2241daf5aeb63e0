<p>A time of freedom, a celebration of youth, and a season destined for happiness.</p>
<p><span></span></p>
<p>At my desk, I feel the sand in my toes, my hair as if filled with sea breeze, and my fingertips touching beautiful, blue waters. Work doesn’t feel like “work” anymore; only a comfortable place to be doing what I love. Summer is always the time we set aside for joy. Growing up, we look forward to summer because it’s always the time for a vacation. Later on, we look forward to it for longer days, giving us more time to spend outdoors, and come nightfall, we don’t mind staying up late. All is well when you’re that happy. That’s just it: Summer is an invitation to be free of care, Spontaneous, and Happy.</p><br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/veromodameblog.wordpress.com/1425/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/veromodameblog.wordpress.com/1425/"></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=veromodame.com&blog=59115430&post=1425&subd=veromodameblog&ref=&feed=1" width="1" height="1">";s:17:"post_image_height";i:632;s:16:"post_image_width";i:647;s:11:"post_visits";i:3;s:18:"post_twitterShares";i:3;s:19:"post_facebookShares";i:0;s:16:"post_totalShares";i:3;s:16:"post_socialScore";i:8;s:13:"post_virality";i:9;s:9:"blog_name";s:17:"VEROMODA The Blog";s:16:"blog_description";s:18:"VEROMODA ME's Blog";s:8:"blog_url";s:22:"http://veromodame.com/";s:11:"blog_author";s:9:"Vero Moda";s:28:"blog_author_twitter_username";s:10:"veromodame";s:13:"blog_rss_feed";s:27:"http://veromodame.com/feed/";s:9:"blog_tags";s:7:"fashion";s:2:"id";i:233;s:11:"blog_active";i:1;s:24:"blog_last_post_timestamp";i:1405664220;s:6:"col_id";N;s:8:"col_name";N;s:16:"col_media_source";N;s:13:"col_home_page";N;s:13:"col_shorthand";N;s:26:"col_media_source_shorthand";N;s:27:"col_author_twitter_username";N;s:8:"col_tags";N;s:15:"col_description";N;s:23:"col_last_post_timestamp";N;}i:1;O:8:"stdClass":36:{s:7:"post_id";i:32846;s:8:"post_url";s:86:"http://blogbaladi.com/banned-anal-exam-gay-test-still-being-used-by-police-in-lebanon/";s:10:"post_title";s:65:"Banned Anal Exam (Gay Test) Still Being Used By Police In Lebanon";s:10:"post_image";s:67:"http://blogbaladi.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/test-of-shame3.jpg";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:123:"Even though this shameful “gay exam” was banned, some doctors are apparently still using it.

<p>Even though this shameful “gay exam” was banned, some doctors are apparently still using it. I won’t bother explain against what happens during this exam because it’s outrageous, humiliating and is considered torture by the UN. Whomever this doctor is, he should be banned for life.</p>
<p>Lebanon needs to drop Article 534 once and for all and stop considering homosexuality a criminal offence in Lebanon. We need more than just <a href="http://blogbaladi.com/lebanese-court-makes-historic-ruling-stating-same-sex-relations-are-not-against-nature-or-a-crime/">exceptional rulings</a> and banning anal exams.</p>
<blockquote><p>Men suspected by authorities of being homosexual are still being anally “tested” in Lebanon despite a ban on the practice issued by health officials, it has been reported. Doctors from the Lebanese Order of Physicians have described the method of determining whether or not a man is gay as useless and akin to “torture”.</p>
<p>The test involves forcefully inserting an egg-shaped metal object into the rectum, which a 2012 Human Rights Watch report said “constitutes degrading and humiliating treatment” in violation of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. According to the Lebanese Daily Star, however, a forensic doctor was hired in January by members of the police’s “Moral Protection Bureau” to determine the sexuality of five Lebanese and Syrian men accused of being gay.

Sukleen roams and reigns over the roads, but there's still a lot that can be done.<p></p></span></div><div><br></div><div><span>Take, for example, a fenced-in field in Mansourieh, totally unoccupied but littered with hundreds of bags of trash. It's a veritable brewing ground for mosquitoes, rodents and other nasty pests, posing a huge human health hazard if one of these carriers bit a passerby or resident in the vicinity. The field is adjacent to a duo of dumpster trucks Sukleen manages, but for some reason, the field has never been tackled. And it’s been like that for years.<p></p></span></div><div><br></div><div><span>I'm not sure if the municipality forbids entry onto this private property, but surely an exception must be made, because the mounds of rubbish are unsightly and potentially dangerous. A few months ago, I was thrilled to hear a Twitter campaign initiated by Virgin Radio Lebanon in collaboration with Sukleen. #VRLgoesgreenwithSukleen was the hashtag to Tweet along with a photo of a littered location in need of a desperate clean-up. <p></p></span></div><div><br></div><div><span>I rushed to the Mansourieh lot, snapped a photo, and tweeted it, receiving immediate acknowledgment and a request for my contact information. Beyond that, there was never any follow-up, and though I again attempted to reach out to @VirginRadioLB, no communication was ever established.<p></p></span></div><div><br></div><div><span>I’m assuming the campaign has either ended or been halted. If that is the case, does anyone know of an organization that’s made it its mission to clean Lebanon with a fine-toothed comb? Would they need some type of access rights to enter the site and collect the rubbish? Under what circumstances, if any, would there be resistance to such a noble endeavor to polish the Lebanese landscape?<p></p></span></div><span></span></div><br><div><a href="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-pb88qI4gzWo/U8Zu7eOay0I/AAAAAAAAClE/C37QDGsSAnk/s640/blogger-image--384133780.jpg" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" height="640" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-pb88qI4gzWo/U8Zu7eOay0I/AAAAAAAAClE/C37QDGsSAnk/s640/blogger-image--384133780.jpg" width="478"></a></div><br><div><a href="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-r8W06h7iQHc/U8Zu8ZEmXCI/AAAAAAAAClM/GflS6FsGnRI/s640/blogger-image--1999503392.jpg" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" height="640" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-r8W06h7iQHc/U8Zu8ZEmXCI/AAAAAAAAClM/GflS6FsGnRI/s640/blogger-image--1999503392.jpg" width="478"></a></div></div>";s:17:"post_image_height";i:480;s:16:"post_image_width";i:359;s:11:"post_visits";i:11;s:18:"post_twitterShares";i:1;s:19:"post_facebookShares";i:3;s:16:"post_totalShares";i:4;s:16:"post_socialScore";i:17;s:13:"post_virality";i:11;s:9:"blog_name";s:10:"Beirutista";s:16:"blog_description";s:29:"Serving Beirut to the public.";s:8:"blog_url";s:31:"http://beirutista.blogspot.com/";s:11:"blog_author";s:13:"Danielle Issa";s:28:"blog_author_twitter_username";s:10:"beirutista";s:13:"blog_rss_feed";s:50:"http://beirutista.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default";s:9:"blog_tags";s:13:"society, food";s:2:"id";i:14;s:11:"blog_active";i:1;s:24:"blog_last_post_timestamp";i:1405571400;s:6:"col_id";N;s:8:"col_name";N;s:16:"col_media_source";N;s:13:"col_home_page";N;s:13:"col_shorthand";N;s:26:"col_media_source_shorthand";N;s:27:"col_author_twitter_username";N;s:8:"col_tags";N;s:15:"col_description";N;s:23:"col_last_post_timestamp";N;}i:5;O:8:"stdClass":36:{s:7:"post_id";i:32842;s:8:"post_url";s:40:"http://endashemdash.com/post/91997230342";s:10:"post_title";s:55:"Unnecessary, overblown, pompous redesign of the day:...";s:10:"post_image";s:94:"http://31.media.tumblr.com/28f51a11a2431923e380461f1c0227d6/tumblr_n8ty46faWP1qzoew2o1_500.png";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:123:"Unnecessary, overblown, pompous redesign of the day: Airbnb.

However, I chose to rename it for the purpose of fairness and giving credit where credit was due, since I managed to squeeze in two rides on the same afternoon/evening with two very different experiences.</p>
<p>Some of you who follow me on Twitter might have noticed that I immediately reached out to <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/tech-ticker/~https://twitter.com/Uber_Beirut" target="_blank">Uber Beirut</a> upon news of their launch. I am a big fan of the hailing app concept and have had the chance to try several apps in several countries starting with Romania.</p>
<p>Uber however is not just any app, and regardless of any controversy that you might have heard, these guys have an excellent business model that is spreading like wildfire and I can totally understand why:
<br>
What’s not to like about the promise of ordering a timely, elegant transport with a courteous driver and a friction-less payment method from the comfort of your smartphone?</p>
<h3>My First Ride in Beirut…Uber-Lebanese</h3>
<p>I set out heading from Badaro to LAU Beirut on Saturday (2014-07-12), and placed my order at 18:53. Surely enough, I was notified that the driver would be arriving within 4 minutes. So far so good, but 4 minutes later with no car in sight, I followed up with a short text to the driver indicating exactly where I would wait for him, to avoid any confusion.
<br>
From there on, things went downhill. It took the driver 32 minutes to reach me. I was seriously panicking that I would not be able to make it on time to LAU.</p>
<p><img src="http://i2.wp.com/tech-ticker.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Uber-Driver-Combo.jpg?resize=894%2C800" alt="Uber-Driver-Combo" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<p>I called the driver to inquire how close he was as the car seemed lost in a maze of streets in Achrafieh. He assured me he was close to the museum but what I was seeing in front of me suggested something else. I then finally spotted him coming towards me but stopping to ask for direction, so I called him again. He saw me also and hung up as he pulled up.</p>
<div>As you see from the info above, I was off to a bad start, and had less than 30 minutes to get to my destination. Doors were to close at 19:45 at LAU. As I got into the car I was surprised again that the driver was not familiar with the area and did not know how to make up for lost time to make it there, so I co-piloted and navigated him through my usual road.</div>
<div></div>
<div>I must, however, in all due conscience, say that he seemed really apologetic and stressed that he had been so late and he was really helpful and courteous through the ride, adjusting the cooling and proposing me a drink of water since he saw I had been sweltering in the heat for 30 minutes. He also did his best to get me to my destination on time. I eventually made it on time  and got off just 15 meters away from the lower gate although he proposed to drive me exactly there. I did not want us to get caught in the Koraytem road maze.</div>
<div></div>
<div>I was left perplex on what to make of this experience. On one hand, I had waited in the heat for half an hour and lost my chance for a decent seating at the event, on the other, the vehicle and the driver were up to my expectation in terms of quality and behavior.</div>
<div>I still do not want to categorically draw any conclusions and perhaps traffic was hard on the way to Badaro from Abdel Wahab Street although on a Saturday afternoon in summer, Beirut is usually traffic free.</div>
<h3>Uber Redeemed by Abbas</h3>
<div>After the ceremony in LAU had finished, we decided to grab a bite at the nearby Deek Duke restaurant (<a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/tech-ticker/~https://www.google.com/maps/place/Deek+Duke/@33.895934,35.479451,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0x1f523092cb1590e" target="_blank">Google Map</a>). I wanted to try again taking Uber. My girlfriend had ordered a ride a few hours before me that day and was extremely satisfied. So I opened the app, GPS blasting, and placed an order. A car was assigned to us a few minutes away. I then monitor the driver skillfully avoiding congested roads to make it on time and arriving at the marker that was supposed to represent our location.</div>
<div></div>
<div>However, as we look around, there was no car anywhere near.</div>
<div>I immediately call the driver, and we quickly realize the app had placed us in Bliss not in Hamra. I bare a lot of the responsibility this time as I did not really zoom in and look at the pin.
<br>
However, he reassured me he had understood where we actually were, and sure enough, a few minutes later a sparkling new BMW Series 5 pulls up.</div>
<div><img src="http://i0.wp.com/tech-ticker.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Uber-Abbas.png?resize=720%2C1280" alt="Uber Abbas" data-recalc-dims="1"></div>
<div>A neatly dressed driver disembarks, introduces himself as Abbas, opening the door for us. <span>Once in the car, he apologizes once more (although he was not to blame for a faulty GPS location in the app) and asks if the air conditioning setting was to our liking and we were comfortably seated. The rest of our drive home was smooth as can be and upon our arrival we got the same royal treatment as when we boarded the vehicle.</span></div>
<h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
<p>Sure, some of you will say I am being tough on the first driver and the company, and that a normal Taxi will have lied and weaseled its way out of this, and even not shown up at all.
<br>
But you know what? This is NOT a random taxi company managed by some fat-bellied, sweat-dripping, flip-flop wearing driver. I based my expectations on the reputation of what is the fastest growing company in this field. Just consider this: <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/tech-ticker/~www.forbes.com/sites/stevenbertoni/2014/05/22/surge-pricing-uber-seeking-12-billion-valuation-in-latest-funding-round/" target="_blank">Uber had recently been seeking $12 Billion valuation in its latest funding round</a></p>
<p>In the entire commotion I had not noticed that I had received a mail follow up. Uber had reacted to the rating of the first drive that I had input on the app even before I got to write this blog post and reacted by giving me a 5$ coupon on the spot. I think this is just one facet of how professional these people are. I also think the driver which I had the unfortunate experience with, has the potential of being an excellent driver as he gets more used to the roads and the process as a whole.</p>
<p>Uber did warn us this was a sort of a “beta” release. Therefore, I will cut them some slack in that area but above all I will thank them for one of the best rides home I have had in a very long time.</p>
<p>Regular Lebanese taxi providers are still in a slumber, but they better wake up really fast and get up to speed with the century. They are about to be heavily outclassed and I honestly do not think they can do anything about it, especially those among them with new fleets and cocky attitudes.</p>

<p>Fellow blogger <a href="http://twitter.com/ghazayel">Mahmoud Ghazayel</a>‘s post about this mistake on Air Arabia’s wall garnered some funny comments from people who wondered whether this was the Lebanese Pre-Independence map or maybe the Post-Da3esh one! Others asked whether the agency finally did what the Lebanese Government failed to do for years, redrawing our borders with Syria!</p>
<p>While we are sure this is an innocent design mistake or lack of attention to details, it is not forgivable when it comes from a big agency specialized in travel and expected to be trustworthy especially when it comes to geography!</p>
<p>We do give <a href="http://facebook.com/airarabiagroup">Air Arabia</a> credit points for promoting Lebanon as a hub for its low fare flights, benefiting both tourism and business in the country. We do ask them however, to make this correction swiftly, keeping Beirut on the map…the right map!</p>

<p>Hey all, through this period you’re gonna see me take lots of casual/everyday outfits ’cause right now I’m in the summer semester at uni and I really don’t have time to dress “chic-ly”, but better ones are coming through August I promise <img src="http://i2.wp.com/www.blondedusk.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" data-jpibfi-description="" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<p>So yesterday I was in a not-so-cheerful mood because of my exam so I wanted to wear some brightcolored items. So I paired this yellow striped T-shirt with some blue jeans and my white sneakers. To add more color I carried this floral print pink bag to break the yellow and white pattern. And not to make everything look SO casual I added my chain silver necklace.</p>
<p>xoxo</p>

<p><a href="https://lfadi.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/1.png"><img src="http://lfadi.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/1.png?w=300&h=266" alt="1" width="300" height="266"></a></p>

<p>The word “falatan” or social mess/chaos has many meanings and can be measured differently according to each society and its traditions. Having sex before marriage for example is not a chaos in Europe, thus a non-virgin European girl can never be considered as a whore regardless of agreeing with the fact or not. Everyone is free in his own life as long as he is not disturbing others’.</p>
<p>Moreover, generalizing a situation taking place in one resort on all resorts is totally unacceptable. Telling that lack of ethics is occurring in Lebanese swimming pools means that most of them to not say all are full of perversity, which is certainly not the case.</p>
<p><a href="https://lfadi.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/2.jpg"><img src="http://lfadi.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/2.jpg?w=300&h=199" alt="2" width="300" height="199"></a></p>
<p><em>Source: <a href="http://www.beiruting.com/" target="_blank"><span dir="ltr">beiruting.com</span></a></em></p>
<p>Below are some of the article’s points I totally disagree with and consider as views’ imposition.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Athena is full of prostitution and immorality:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So everyone in Athena is either a streetwalker or a pimp?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mykonos is the uncontrolled capital of gays:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Regardless of being homosexuals not gays, what is surveillance needed for?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nudist beaches and nobody cares:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Why should anybody care? A person opposing such places is free to avoid them.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pool or Cabaret:</p>
</blockquote>
<ul><li>Dancing on the bar while wearing a swimwear is totally normal when on the beach. Many people are avoiding such places since this fact is bothering them and contradicting with their habits, which is totally normal. Every person should respect others’ rules in addition to having his own rules that should be respected.</li>
<li>Many resorts in Lebanon have free entrance for girls before 11:00 or 12:00 due to the bad touristic movement. They are sacrificing access fees with the hope of having more people inside to spend money on food and drinks.</li>
<li>The pool in the article’s photo is 18+ and no kids are allowed inside. Therefore, no harm in children’s education.</li>
</ul><blockquote><p>Porn film – Kissing in the pool before ending up in the bed:</p></blockquote>
<p>I am not willing to comment on this point, mostly that I think having sex in public couldn’t take place in Lebanon without arresting both parties.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>P.S.: I am not defending the resort which I think most of us recognized it and I totally agree that morals and ethics should be respected, particularly in public places, but limiting others’ freedom just because you disagree with and generalizing a case as if all resorts in Lebanon are full of prostitution is inadmissible.</p>

<p>What hit us first was the cool neutral white “loungy” venue in Dowtown Dubai, where everything seemed to shout out minimalism and modernity. Until the bright coloured lights came to life (pretty close to the Microsoft logo color pattern), then we totally understood we were aboard a fresh new ride alongside Microsoft taking over Nokia’s legacy in a brand new fashion.</p>
<p>After the meet and greet moments, we went on to mingle with our friends from the regional media, and went straight on to the Corporate keynotes, whereby the Microsoft team laid out their strategy for their mobile division, emphasising on how the Microsoft cross-device experience is meant to go seamless no matter the device used: desktop, laptop, smartphone, tablet, game console… the main effort done on the Windows UI is to unify all aspects in order to make the Windows experience feel like home for the user. And in many ways, the company did achieve this, just by looking at the way things blend in, in terms of global UI, cloud sharing services, and so on.</p>
<p>The highlight of the evening was undeniably the announcement of the Lumia 930, which came right after that of the Lumia 630 and 635, which embodied Microsoft and Nokia’s efforts to bring in the best of smartphone experience to the masses, in the most elegant and complete package you could ever think of at that pricing level.</p>
<p>The Lumia 930 has everything we could ever ask from a modern time flagship smartphone: an awesome design and build quality, lightness in weight, freshness through its back cover color palette (ranging from orange to green, with classic white and black also available), killer specifications (Snapdragon 800 chipset, 2GB of RAM, FullHD OLED ClearBlack display, 20MP Pureview shooter). We undeniably had a smiling grin on our faces, since this was pretty much the very first time we felt that Windows Phone can finally be called “Complete”. This feeling did not only come from design and specs, but also from the inherent feeling the new Windows Phone 8.1 experience brought along. The software now sports almost every single feature available in every other competing smartphone OS out there. I personally was happy, simply because back in the time when Windows Phone was first released to the market, I found it to be the most beautiful UI out there, but immediately felt that there was a long way to go in order to achieve the maturity other OS like iOS or Android were building for themselves. I can finally say now that the mission looks pretty accomplished as of today.</p>
<p>Taken by that same wave of Tech bliss, we had the opportunity to sit with Mr. Ifi Majid, Global Head of Mobile Devices Marketing at Microsoft and ask him a few questions about the new Microsoft experience.</p>
<p></p><hr><ul><li><em>On a personal level, since you’re coming from Nokia initially, how did the whole integration with Microsoft go?</em></li>
</ul><p>The whole thing went seamlessly. It is still an ongoing process, but everything went very naturally. There were no harsh changes in the business, just a boost in terms of motivation, since we feel we have new challenges now.</p>
<ul><li><em>Can you tell us more about the Nokia brand? Will it disappear in favor of Microsoft or any other new branding under Microsoft? Or will it be sustained in an effort to maintain Nokia’s mobile phone legacy?</em></li>
</ul><p>Things are not clear thus far, and we cannot really communicate on that very matter. So far, as we can see with the Lumia 930, the Nokia brand has been kept alive, as it is still featured on the device. But where do we go from here is still not final yet.</p>
<ul><li><em>Talking about the Lumia 930, do you really feel that it is a true flagship device? Meaning, is it up to par with all currently available competing flagship devices out there? Does it lack something others currently have?</em></li>
</ul><p>What can I say? It has an awesome design by all means, it’s light, it’s powerful, it’s equipped with the latest chipset currently available, a monster camera, and a plethora of apps, including all major apps users would look for. Even the OS got way better with WP 8.1, as it can perform practically all stunts and tricks other platforms do and more. Wouldn’t you call it a true flagship?</p>
<ul><li><em>It is indeed a flagship in many ways. But don’t you feel you need to be more aggressive on the pricing if you want to penetrate the market and convert people from Android or iOS to Windows Phone?</em></li>
</ul><p>You’re right. This is where the Lumia 630/635 comes in. These devices offer premium features and specs in a totally sexy and extremely affordable package. This is how we want people to convert to Windows Phone; by offering them a complete and affordable way in.</p>

Sources suggest that current IS members have old ties to militant group Fatah al-Islam, which clashed with the Lebanese Army in Nahr al-Bared camp back in 2007. Back then, the group&rsquo;s leader was accused of being a Syrian operative engaged in destabilizing Lebanon&rsquo;s government. Today, circumstantial evidence also raises the possibility of the IS having been infiltrated by Syrian intelligence so as to gear the group&rsquo;s activities towards the regime&rsquo;s interests.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The formal declaration of an Islamic state by insurgents in Syria and Iraq reverberated immediately in Lebanon. Soon thereafter, the IS assigned a man identified as Abdel Salam al-Ordoni as the organization's emir, or leader, in Lebanon.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Days before this, security forces had intercepted jihadist cells at the Napoleon and Duroy Hotels in Beirut, which, according to reports, had been dispatched by ISIS to carry out suicide attacks against Hezbollah strongholds. The Islamic State claimed responsibility and has since been issuing threats to both Hezbollah and the Lebanese government.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In one of its statements, the IS dedicated a song to Islamist inmates at Roumieh prison calling for their release, and set the holy month of Ramadan as a deadline past which it would use its own means to set them free, alluding to a possible attack against Lebanese armed forces.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The Islamic State and Fatah al-Islam</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>According to reports, Monther Khaldoun al-Hassan, a Lebanese resident from Akkar, is suspected of provisioning suicide bombers and other ISIS networks in Lebanon with suicide belts and explosives. General Security circulated a photo of Hassan, who is believed to be operating under Ordoni&rsquo;s leadership. Information leaked to Lebanese media outlets suggests that Hassan is a resident of Tripoli, though it seems few Tripoli residents know him.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A Syrian man with ties to locals who have fought alongside Syrian opposition groups,&nbsp;currently living in Tripoli, told NOW that Hassan comes from a family of militant jihadists. His brother Moatasem, he said, was the first Lebanese to execute a suicide bombing in Syria, detonating himself at a Syrian army checkpoint in Talkalakh last year. A second brother was killed in clashes that followed the attack. Hassan&rsquo;s uncle, Khaled Mahmoud, also referred to as &ldquo;Abu Suleiman,&rdquo; was leader of the Jund al-Sham group in Qalat al-Hosn in Talkalakh. Two other uncles fought with Fatah al-Islam in the Nahr al-Bared conflict in 2007 &ndash; one is believed to be the militant who blew himself up in the Tripoli raid that paved the way for the clashes, and the other has been arrested for similar charges and is currently in Roumieh prison.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The Syrian national, who preferred to remain anonymous for security reasons, told NOW that Hassan initially travelled to Syria to join Jabhat al-Nusra, but left Nusra to join ISIS under Ordoni&rsquo;s leadership. Men like Hassan, he said, who travel to Syria to fight alongside opposition groups, also tend to support ISIS.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Brothers in arms: the 2003 Iraq war</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Sitting outside his corner store, a middle-aged man who goes by the name Abu Mohamad observes passersby as they rush from one store to another shopping before Iftar. Somewhat reluctantly, he tells NOW that &ldquo;to understand the relation between ISIS and Fatah al-Islam you need to go back in time to the [2003] Iraq war.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Retired from security forces, Abu Mohamad, who is of Palestinian origin and had close ties to Palestinian factions living inside Nahr al-Bared, says Fatah al-Islam had previously fought in Iraq under the leadership of infamous al-Qaeda member Abu Musab al-Zarqawi. Returning to Lebanon, the group and their leader, Shaker al-Abbsi, as well as youths he met in Iraq &ndash; Lebanese, Syrians and Palestinians &ndash; set themselves up in Fatah Al-Intifada&rsquo;s headquarters in western Bekaa, and then headed for Nahr al-Bared camp in northern Lebanon.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;The idea of ISIS,&rdquo; Abu Mohamad says, &ldquo;was one propagated by Zarqawi&rsquo;s group in Iraq. Thanks to modern-day technology,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;the group was able to reconnect with what was left of the old fighters who were either in hiding or are serving time in Roumieh prison.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Zarqawi, a militant Islamist from Jordan, began coordinating the entry of al-Qaeda operatives into Iraq through Syria shortly before the invasion of Iraq in March 2003. By the Fall of year, a steady flow of Arab Islamists were infiltrating Iraq, Lebanese fighters among them. &ldquo;Sheikh al-Qaa'qaa, an imam from Aleppo,&rdquo; says Abu Mohamad &ldquo;called for jihad publically, and every Friday he would give fiery sermons and then fill the buses with men, and send them straight over into Iraq.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Jihadists infiltrated by Syrian regime intelligence</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>One month into the Syrian people&rsquo;s uprising against President Bashar al Assad&rsquo;s regime, the government freed over 200 political prisoners, including Islamists and Kurds, from the notorious Saydnaya prison in Damascus. Maher Esber, then a political prisoner and now a political activist, fled Syria to Lebanon. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>According to Esber, and based on his cell mates&rsquo; personal accounts, the Syrian regime was well aware of the flow of jihadists into Iraq and at times even coordinated their safe passage. One Islamist, he said, talked of how the military and political security branches distributed permits to jihadists allowing them to cross military checkpoints from Syria into Iraq in cars and vans carrying armor. A Lebanese inmate spoke of how the Lebanese were being recruited by Baath party members.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Among the stories, he says, was one about a militant group called Jund al-Sham, formed by five Syrians who were close to Zarqawi. Near the end of 2004, and after their success in Iraq, they proposed to Zarqawi that they carry out similar operations in Syria. Zarqawi advised them not to, but they decided to anyway, and began liaising with Ghazi Kenaan, Syria&rsquo;s interior minister at the time. &ldquo;Syrian intelligence knew what they were up to and killed them all,&rdquo; said Esber, &ldquo;along with Kenaan, with the exception of one of the five founders, whose name was Abu Abdallah al-Zamel.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Esber explained that Zamel would often accuse Fatah al-Islam inmates of being spies for the regime. Shaker al-Abssi, he would say, is believed to have been released from Syrian prison for the purpose of forming a militant group that would destabilize Lebanon.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;One of our inmates was a Syrian intelligence operative,&rdquo; said Esber. &ldquo;He worked closely with Jamil al-Hassan, Jawiya [Air Force Brigade] intelligence chief at the time. He was tasked with infiltrating the Fatah al-Islam group. He was embedded with them for months and was gathering information about their activities.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Apart from leadership,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;members of Fatah al-Islam were not aware that their high-ranking members were coordinating closely with the Syrian regime&rsquo;s intelligence.&rdquo; &nbsp;</p><p>                                      Sources say Shaker Al-Abbsi was released by the Syrian regime to destabilize Lebanon.

Determined atheists that we both are, as the Black Label bottle steadily drained our conversation turned, as it often would, to the evergreen subject of the woefully elevated positions of the region&rsquo;s Parties of God in all their forms and guises.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Man, let me show you something,&rdquo; he suddenly said, reaching for the TV remote. &ldquo;This is why the secularists can&rsquo;t beat the Islamists today.&rdquo; Flicking to one of at least a dozen available Islamic channels, we listened as a shrouded televangelist expounded on the boundless splendors of the pious path. &ldquo;Just listen to the guy&rsquo;s fusha [classical Arabic],&rdquo; my friend said in sincere admiration. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s effortless.&rdquo; And so it was &ndash; without the slightest stutter or pause, our imam filled the room with the music of 7th -century Arabian vocabulary, every single letter adorned with precisely the correct diacritical flourish. Picture someone mellifluously chatting in the tongue of Shakespeare and you&rsquo;ll get something of the oratorical effect.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Now compare that with these guys,&rdquo; said my friend, switching to a political talk show featuring two beardless Jordanians in suits. Clearly ill-at-ease in the fusha they were compelled (by widely-observed custom) to speak on air &ndash; which is likely the only time they speak it &ndash; the contrast in style was disastrous. In awkward monotone, they would punctuate every other word with an &ldquo;uhhh&rdquo; as they frantically scanned their limited mental lexicons for the formally proper noun or adjective. &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter that what they&rsquo;re saying is a thousand times more enlightening than the Islamist propaganda,&rdquo; my friend said. &ldquo;Who could listen to this for more than thirty seconds?&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>That thought came rushing back to me on Saturday when I watched another Islamist, the fugitive cleric-cum-militiaman Ahmad al-Assir, mount an 11-minute-long diatribe  against the &ldquo;liberals&rdquo; (what contempt he put into the word) of Lebanon&rsquo;s moderate Sunni Future Movement. Secure in his amply-demonstrated fusha proficiency, Assir actually reverted to colloquial dialect to land his most personal jab, directed at Future leader Saad Hariri, &ldquo;who doesn&rsquo;t know how to string two words together in Arabic.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s a reference to the former prime minister&rsquo;s famously shaky fusha, most memorably demonstrated in a calamitous  2009 parliament address. But Assir wasn&rsquo;t trying to score literary points: he meant to undermine Hariri&rsquo;s religious, and ultimately political, legitimacy as the representative of Lebanon&rsquo;s Sunnis. It was an assertion of the supposed authenticity, the unshakeable Arabness, of Islamism compared to effete and decadent liberalism.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Older generations of Arab nationalist intellectuals championed the revival and protection of Arabic out of fear that &ldquo;the nation&rdquo; and its culture were losing ground to an ascendant West. Today, the new and graver danger is of young Arab minds being seduced by hyper-articulate jihadists, to whose rhetorical charms even this British kafir is not entirely invulnerable.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Among other things, this makes all the more necessary the secular Arabic literary heritage, from the classic pre-Islamic mu`allaqat through such brilliant medieval reprobates as Abu Nuwas to modern giants like Mahmoud Darwish. Indeed, there&rsquo;s reason to believe a thread running through the entire oeuvre of the permanently clean-shaven Darwish, who never hid his dislike of Hamas and lamented those who &ldquo;don&rsquo;t know the difference between the mosque (al-jam`) and the university (al-jam`a),&rdquo; was an unspoken determination to claim Arabic (and specifically classical Arabic, the clerics&rsquo; home ground) for an avowedly secular renaissance, or nahda. (The contribution of those who manage to turn these works into music and other art forms &ndash; Marcel Khalif&eacute; being perhaps the most obvious example &ndash; is also invaluable, not least because of the profanity of music in and of itself in the Wahhabist worldview. One recalls Khalif&eacute;&rsquo;s farcical 1999 blasphemy trial.) Unless and until that is achieved, the Islamists will continue to exploit the appearance of an intellectual &ndash; and even cultural &ndash; superiority that is of course entirely and dangerously illusory.</p><p>                                      Ahmad al-Assir addressing an audience (Source: saidaonline.com)                                   </p><p>                                      Assir wasn’t trying to score literary points: he meant to undermine Hariri’s religious, and ultimately political, legitimacy as the representative of Lebanon’s Sunnis"                                   </p>";s:17:"post_image_height";i:394;s:16:"post_image_width";i:616;s:11:"post_visits";i:8;s:18:"post_twitterShares";i:71;s:19:"post_facebookShares";i:229;s:16:"post_totalShares";i:300;s:16:"post_socialScore";i:31;s:13:"post_virality";i:46;s:9:"blog_name";N;s:16:"blog_description";N;s:8:"blog_url";N;s:11:"blog_author";N;s:28:"blog_author_twitter_username";N;s:13:"blog_rss_feed";N;s:9:"blog_tags";N;s:2:"id";N;s:11:"blog_active";N;s:24:"blog_last_post_timestamp";N;s:6:"col_id";i:9;s:8:"col_name";s:22:"Alex Rowell (NOW Blog)";s:16:"col_media_source";s:17:"Now Lebanon Blogs";s:13:"col_home_page";s:46:"https://now.mmedia.me/lb/en/Author/Alex.Rowell";s:13:"col_shorthand";s:14:"alexrowell-now";s:26:"col_media_source_shorthand";s:11:"now_lebanon";s:27:"col_author_twitter_username";s:13:"disgraceofgod";s:8:"col_tags";s:8:"politics";s:15:"col_description";s:151:"Alex Rowell joined NOW in Beirut as a reporter and blogger in February 2012.

Chicklets is trumpeting via a campaign which involved a teaser and a badly laid out revealer of their redesign, hower, if you have bough Chicklets bubble gum anytime since at least 6 months, you'd have realised the redesign of the package is not new. Which of course begs the question of what now.<br>
The only good thing about the campaign is the line "ta2 el 7anak sar elo ta3me" - "ta2 el 7anak" figuratively means time wasting, but also means literally "the sound make by the lower jaw" (in reference to talking too much i.e. gosspiping and in this case chewing the gum).<br>
Usually the expression is "ta2 7anak bala ta2me" or "too much moving of the jaw without any taste"... Which brings us to the line "moving of the jaw is now full of taste".<br>
The new campaign pales in comaprison with Elie Elias project from USEK on Chicklets which you can find <a href="http://beirutntsc.blogspot.com/2012/06/usek-student-elie-roger-elias-and-his.html">here</a>!</div>";s:17:"post_image_height";i:560;s:16:"post_image_width";i:1024;s:11:"post_visits";i:17;s:18:"post_twitterShares";i:1;s:19:"post_facebookShares";i:2;s:16:"post_totalShares";i:3;s:16:"post_socialScore";i:22;s:13:"post_virality";i:9;s:9:"blog_name";s:25:"Never Twice the Same City";s:16:"blog_description";s:33:"Beirut, Never Twice the Same City";s:8:"blog_url";s:30:"http://beirutntsc.blogspot.com";s:11:"blog_author";s:13:"Tarek Chemaly";s:28:"blog_author_twitter_username";s:10:"beirutntsc";s:13:"blog_rss_feed";s:50:"http://beirutntsc.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default";s:9:"blog_tags";s:19:"advertising, design";s:2:"id";i:16;s:11:"blog_active";i:1;s:24:"blog_last_post_timestamp";i:1405700520;s:6:"col_id";N;s:8:"col_name";N;s:16:"col_media_source";N;s:13:"col_home_page";N;s:13:"col_shorthand";N;s:26:"col_media_source_shorthand";N;s:27:"col_author_twitter_username";N;s:8:"col_tags";N;s:15:"col_description";N;s:23:"col_last_post_timestamp";N;}}
