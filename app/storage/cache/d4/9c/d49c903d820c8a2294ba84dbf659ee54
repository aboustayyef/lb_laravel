<p><span><strong>It’s simple: you have never seen a movie like <em>Boyhood </em>before, and you likely never will again. Shot over a 12-year period with the same cast, Richard Linklater’s latest is the definition of a masterpiece, and it’s hands down the best movie of the year, and one of the most memorable cinematic experiences you will ever have. </strong></span></p>
<p><span>I’m honestly not even sure how I’m supposed to describe the plot, because it genuinely feels like you’re watching real life unfold before your very eyes. The film’s protagonist, Mason (Ellar Coltane) literally grows up on screen, and we watch him deal with life, one moment at a time. It’s mind-blowingly impressive from a technical perspective, but it’s also extremely real and deceptively simple. Again, it’s like watching real life. I’m just going to leave it at that.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://ageeksblogdotcom1.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/boyhood2.jpg"><img src="http://ageeksblogdotcom1.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/boyhood2.jpg?w=650&h=455" alt="boyhood2"></a></p>
<p><span>For one, director Richard Linklater deserves heaps of praise for this meticulously crafted piece of art. Never in my life have I experienced something like this, and it truly is an <em>experience. </em>The performances he manages to get out of these actors, particularly Ellar Coltrane and Lorelei Linklater (who plays Mason’s sister, Samantha) are incredible. They’ve really matured into solid actors.</span></p>
<p><span>I fell in love with how time progresses in <em>Boyhood. </em>Whether it’s a perfectly timed musical cue, pop culture reference, or a shot of one of the young actors now looking a bit older, it just works. The soundtrack is also brilliant and consists of some of my favorite bands, so that’s also a huge plus.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://ageeksblogdotcom1.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/boyhood-4.png"><img src="http://ageeksblogdotcom1.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/boyhood-4.png?w=650&h=349" alt="Boyhood-4"></a></p>
<p><span>Patricia Arquette and Ethan Hawke are perfect as Mason and Samantha’s parents, and their relationship with their kids is a big part of why this film succeeds. You forget that you’re watching a movie and start believing that they’re their actual parents, which comes as a result of Linklater’s amazing 12-year effort to bring this story to life. </span></p>
<p><span>But the movie is so much more than just a sprawling epic that spans half a decade; it’s an extremely personal tale of a young boy finding himself and learning about life. Mason goes from a wide-eyed five-year-old kid to this pensive, often gloomy teenager, and I for one couldn’t help but relate to him and his struggles. In fact, everyone can relate to some part of his life, which makes this movie so damn resonant.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://ageeksblogdotcom1.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/75.jpg"><img src="http://ageeksblogdotcom1.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/75.jpg?w=650&h=455" alt="75"></a></p>
<p><span><em>Boyhood</em> is also extremely funny, and it feels so effortless thanks to the incredible writing and flawless performances. There’s also some great tension, and whenever you think you know where the story is going, it goes in a completely different direction. The film is almost three hours long, yet not one single scene felt unnecessary or indulgent. In fact, I could have easily sat there for another five hours.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>The Verdict:</strong></span></p>
<p><span><em>Boyhood</em> is one of the greatest cinematic achievements of our generation, but don’t take my word for it, experience it for yourself. You’ll be happy you did. It’s a masterpiece in every sense of the word.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Numerical Score: 10/10</strong></span></p>

I thought you should know this fact because it’s the only damn thing left for Hollywood to exploit in a franchise. This ridiculous sequel is more of the same, only less likable; Once a year, for 12 hours, the government condones robbery, rape and murder. That’s cue for five good people to wind up running for their lives on the nasty streets of Los Angeles during this night of terror. Considering the number of horror disappointments with a “2″ after the title, I did not approach this movie with much optimism, even though director James DeMonaco shows a sure hand at building tension. Sadly, my fear was justified 10 minutes later. The idea of a Purge isn’t merely a bad concept, but a dumb and irrelevant one. And even that could have been forgiven had the movie actually tried to have fun with the idea in the first place, but it does not. The movie plods along between plot points without any direction and you can see every turn in the plot coming for miles. As far as sequels go, “The Purge: Anarchy” is silly, repetitive, and far from interesting. I say skip it.</p>

<p><span><strong>This summer has been a mixed bag when it comes to R-rated comedies. While flicks like <em>22 Jump Street </em>and <em>Neighbors </em>have been embraced by the general public, others like <em>Tammy </em>and <em>A Million Ways to Die in the West </em>have been less reliable. <em>Sex Tape</em>, I’m sad to say, is largely devoid of any laughs, and wastes a mostly talented cast (I say mostly because I quite dislike Cameron Diaz) and a clever premise on lazy, unfunny, and obnoxious jokes.</strong></span></p>
<p><span>Annie (Cameron Diaz) and Jay (Jason Segel) have been married for a while, and their sex life isn’t what it used to be. In an attempt to spice things up, the two make a sex tape that accidentally ends up getting uploaded to the cloud, which means all their friends and family now have access to it. It’s now up to them to make sure no one watches that tape, no matter what it takes.</span></p>
<p><span><a href="https://ageeksblogdotcom1.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/sex-tape-movie__iphone_640.jpg"><span><img src="http://ageeksblogdotcom1.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/sex-tape-movie__iphone_640.jpg?w=650&h=389" alt="sex-tape-movie__iphone_640"></span></a></span></p>
<p><span>I’m going to be completely blunt; I’m not a fan of Cameron Diaz. Call me biased, I don’t care, but she has no acting chops. Not that she’s the only issue with <em>Sex Tape</em>, but she’s certainly a big part of the problem. I was cringing every time she opened her mouth, and her chemistry with Jason Segel was non-existant. Speaking of Segel, he was quite off as well, which is weird and disappointing considering he’s one of my favorite comedic actors. This is totally unrelated, but I was also really distracted by how skinny he now looks; it took me around half the movie’s running time to get used to it.</span></p>
<p><span>The screenplay, which was co-written by Segel and comedy veteran Nicholas Stoller (among others), is terrible. Jokes fall flat left and right, and everyone is simply trying too hard to be raunchy that it comes off as desperate. The bland and uninspired direction by Jake Kasdan also adds nothing to the yawn-inducing dialogue. The only positives about the flick are Rob Lowe, who plays Annie’s soon to be boss, and the ever-reliable Rob Corddry as Annie and Jay’s longtime friend. Everything and everyone else is just a waste of air.</span></p>

<p><span><strong>The Verdict:</strong></span></p>
<p><span><em>Sex Tape</em> really could have been something special. Instead, it’s a boring and obnoxious mess with only a handful of laughs. As a massive Jason Segel fan, I was extremely disappointed. You’re better off staying home and making your own sex tape.</span></p>

Do you hear me Jack?"</span></i><br><br>After a highly generic season, I didn't expect this finale to be such a monumental gut-punch. But it was <b>glorious</b>. <br><br>Let me be this clear, this wasn't a <u>bad</u> season of <i>24</i>. It was well-executed, and it felt like classic Jack Bauer with the requisite double crosses, big bads, and shootouts. But it also didn't offer anything new (and maybe a large part of the audience wasn't craving that). But the television landscape has changed immensely since <i>24</i> left the airwaves in 2010. Bombshell twists have become a weekly occurrence, and shows today rarely shy away from killing off central characters (a feat that was <i>24</i>'s bread and butter back when it first stormed onto the scene). And aside from the show's unique format, this season felt largely derivative and by-the-numbers; nothing ever really surprised me throughout the course of these 12 episodes. I never felt like I was dying to watch the next episode. Instead, I kept watching out of habit and sheer loyalty to Jack Bauer (one of my most favorite characters of all time). <br><br>And that's why this finale was so good. It shocked me. In fact, it blew my brains out, particularly with the gruesome murder of Jack's one true love, Audrey. I honestly never expected the writing staff to kill her off after everything she'd been through, but ultimately, this act further reiterated something we've known all along: <i>24</i> is a tragic story, and Jack will never <i>really</i> get his happy ending. On the bright side, Audrey's death gave Jack a magnificent final rampage which Keifer Sutherland sold perfectly. The utter desolation on Jack's face after Kate's call, the hopelessness as he takes out his gun (undoubtedly read to off himself), and finally his renewed determination as he shoots, smashes and slices everyone in his path. It's a marvelous crescendo of violence that culminates with Jack brutally decapitating Cheng. And as horrifying as his act is, it's also strangely cheery-worthy and satisfying. <u><b>Wow. </b></u><br><br>Surprisingly, President Heller stood out as the show's MVP this year. William Devane delivered consistently solid work across the season, and he was downright transcendent in the finale. I found myself teary-eyed as the President heard the news of his daughter's passing and crashed to the ground. But I was astounded by his beautiful acceptance of his Alzheimer's during Audrey's burial, and his gratitude in the fact that he would eventually forget the traumas he endured. If I had doubts that the disease would serve any significant purpose in the beginning of the season, they were suitably put to rest by the time this grim and enormously haunting sequence came to light. <br><br>I know many people hated <i>24</i>'s series finale back in 2010 (with Jack ending his journey on the run), but I found it to be a pretty much perfect ending to the saga. So imagine my surprise when I loved this finale's ending as well. Jack gladly sacrificed his freedom in exchange for his "best friend" Chloe. It's a surprisingly uplifting sort of ending with Jack also finding penance for Audrey's death (the guilt would have eaten him alive). And naturally, Jack surviving the season means FOX will be investing in the show's return if the ratings are good enough. I just wonder if that's even necessary; can <i>24</i> ever really be groundbreaking again? I think I'd love to find out. <br><br><span><b>Ticking Bits</b></span><br><br>- Mark telling Jack that Audrey loves him made me smile. <br><br>- Again, I must stress how heartbreaking Audrey's death was. The fact that a tear streamed down her cheek before she accepted her death and peacefully closed her eyes was just harrowing. <br><br>- Time jump! First time ever on the show; didn't really feel all that special honestly. <br><br>- I don't know how I feel about Kate's character arc this year. Her quitting at the end made me feel like I invested in her plight for nothing. Still, it was great to see Jack trust her in saving Audrey (haha). <br><br>- I can't remember if I ever like Chloe during the show's original run (I binge-watched it all within the span of a month), but she did absolutely nothing for me this year. Still, I appreciate what she means to Jack and how pivotal she is to his journey.<br><br>- Seriously, that final helicopter sequence was beautiful. <br><br><span><b>Conclusion</b></span><br>An incredibly exciting and powerful closer to a somewhat disappointing season. If this is indeed the end, at least Jack Bauer's legacy was left intact. Superb. <br><br><span><b>Nad Rating</b></span><br><span><span><b>A</b></span></span></div></div>";s:17:"post_image_height";i:1026;s:16:"post_image_width";i:1600;s:11:"post_visits";i:4;s:18:"post_twitterShares";i:2;s:19:"post_facebookShares";i:6;s:16:"post_totalShares";i:8;s:16:"post_socialScore";i:13;s:13:"post_virality";i:17;s:9:"blog_name";s:13:"Nad's Reviews";s:16:"blog_description";s:72:"Nad's Reviews specializes in TV reviews as well as films and restaurants";s:8:"blog_url";s:27:"http://www.nadsreviews.com/";s:11:"blog_author";s:3:"Nad";s:28:"blog_author_twitter_username";s:11:"NadsReviews";s:13:"blog_rss_feed";s:54:"http://www.nadsreviews.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss";s:9:"blog_tags";s:18:"tv, culture, media";s:2:"id";i:162;s:11:"blog_active";i:1;s:24:"blog_last_post_timestamp";i:1405593540;s:6:"col_id";N;s:8:"col_name";N;s:16:"col_media_source";N;s:13:"col_home_page";N;s:13:"col_shorthand";N;s:26:"col_media_source_shorthand";N;s:27:"col_author_twitter_username";N;s:8:"col_tags";N;s:15:"col_description";N;s:23:"col_last_post_timestamp";N;}i:8;O:8:"stdClass":36:{s:7:"post_id";i:32865;s:8:"post_url";s:85:"http://speaktheblues.blogspot.com/2014/07/blues-legend-johnny-winter-passes-away.html";s:10:"post_title";s:48:"Blues Legend Johnny Winter Passes Away at Age 70";s:10:"post_image";s:117:"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-W83r99ZWNL4/U8eDof5Am3I/AAAAAAAACtg/R0wAy_djXsc/s1600/Johnny-Winter-Artist-HD-Wallpaper.jpg";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:123:"[SOURCE]This is a truly sad day for the blues; the blues and guitar legend Johnny Winter has passed away at the age of 7...";s:7:"blog_id";s:13:"speaktheblues";s:14:"post_timestamp";i:1405585080;s:12:"post_content";s:3370:"<br><div><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-W83r99ZWNL4/U8eDof5Am3I/AAAAAAAACtg/R0wAy_djXsc/s1600/Johnny-Winter-Artist-HD-Wallpaper.jpg" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-W83r99ZWNL4/U8eDof5Am3I/AAAAAAAACtg/R0wAy_djXsc/s1600/Johnny-Winter-Artist-HD-Wallpaper.jpg" height="380" width="540"></a></div><div><br></div><div>[<a href="http://consequenceofsound.net/2014/07/r-i-p-johnny-winter-blues-legend-dead-at-70/" target="_blank">SOURCE</a>]</div><div><br></div><div>This is a truly sad day for the blues; the blues and guitar legend Johnny Winter has passed away at the age of 70.

<p><strong><span>Home. Family. Future. Yup, looks like Caesar and co. have taken over the Lebanese box office. <em><span><a href="http://ageeksblog.com/2014/07/11/movie-review-dawn-of-the-planet-of-the-apes-2014/">Dawn of the Planet of the Apes</a></span></em> took the first spot this weekend with 9,407 admissions. While not a spectacular opening (it trails other summer movie openings like <em>Spider-Man, </em><em>Godzilla, Maleficent, and X-Men</em>), it’s important to keep in mind that the world cup final likely kept a decent chunk of viewers away. Also, the <em>Planet of the Apes</em> franchise doesn’t have huge name recognition in the Middle East, and Andy Serkis isn’t a household name with the general moviegoing audience. Still, great word of mouth should make this a popular choice for weeks to come.</span></strong></p>
<p><span>After three weeks on top, <em><span><a href="https://ageeksblog.com/2014/06/11/movie-review-22-jump-street-2014/">22 Jump Street</a></span></em> finally got dethroned. The film scored an additional 4,932 admissions, raising its total to an excellent 38,182 tickets sold in four weeks. <em><span><a href="https://ageeksblog.com/2014/06/02/movie-review-maleficent-2014/">Maleficent</a></span>,</em> which is showing no signs of slowing down, literally dropped by 1% from last weekend, adding 3,853 admissions for an insane total of 80,555. At this rate, there’s no telling how high these numbers can go.</span></p>
<p><span><em>Qu’est ce Qu’on A Fait Au Bon Dieu?</em> actually climbed two spots and landed in fourth place. It’s also showing incredible legs; it dropped by less than 0.3 percent from last weekend’s numbers. <em><span><a href="https://ageeksblog.com/2014/06/23/movie-review-think-like-a-man-too-2014/">Think Like a Man Too</a></span></em> landed in the fifth spot with 2,407 admissions, for a new sum of 12,867 admissions after three weeks.</span></p>
<p><span>Other notable figures include the new release <em><span><a href="http://tlkabtmovies.com/2014/07/15/cold-in-july-2014/">Cold in July</a></span></em>, which rounded out the top ten with 442 admissions from seven theaters, and <em>Avis De Mistral</em>, which opened in the eleventh spot with 344 admissions from only three theaters. </span></p>

But at least this hour restored a sense of fun to the proceedings, while sustaining the show's signature wit. There's a long way to go before <i>True Blood</i> can reclaim its luster (it probably won't though I'd love to be proven otherwise), but this was the season's first <b>truly</b> effective hour.</div><div><br></div><div>Simply put, I attribute this episode's success to the epic flashbacks featuring Pam and Eric. It was fantastic to see the beginnings of Fangtasia (an adult video store no less), and the defining moment of Eric becoming Sheriff. The fact that the writers managed to tie the bar's history to Ginger was just icing on the cake. It's subplots such as this one that supply the show with a sense of gravitas and weight after seven seasons worth of storytelling. However....</div><div><br></div><div>Why are we still wasting time on sequences as pointless as Jason and Sam visiting Kevin's wife Rosie? And if you don't know who the latter two are, I don't blame you because they're enormously superfluous characters. It boggles my mind that <i>True Blood</i>'s writing staff is still so oblivious to the screen-time they waste on useless characters and subplots. I guess some things will never change and I need to make peace with that. </div><div><br></div><div><span><b>Bloody Bits</b></span></div><div><br></div><div>- Jason calling Hoyt and telling him about his momma was kind of touching I guess.</div><div><br></div><div>- Laugh-out loud moment: the Magister throwing the keys at Pam who blankly stares at him instead of catching them.</div><div><br></div><div>- The green screen effect with Sam and Jason driving was shockingly horrendous. <b>Really</b> HBO? You can't afford something that looks marginally believable?</div><div><br></div><div>- Sookie getting through to Jessica with her speech was probably one of the character's better moments. She still sucks as a protagonist. </div><div><br></div><div>- I can't get over the fact that Ginger came up with the idea for Fangtasia. Her entire pitch with Eric on the throne was beyond priceless and awesome. Naturally, Pam stole her idea. </div><div><br></div><div>- Hilariously sad sight with Eric struggling to punch through the wall. </div><div><br></div><div>- Fascinating moment with Pam telling Bill that it will <b>never</b> work out for him and Sookie. </div><div><br></div><div>- The fight sequence wasn't bad huh? Could have been longer though. </div><div><br></div><div>- Badass moment: Jason blowing the vamp to bits and saving Sookie. </div><div><br></div><div>- As if I needed further proof that Carrie Preston was a exceptional actress, she went on ahead and delivered that brilliant hallucination scene as she reconnected with Terry before almost-dying. <u>Wow</u>. </div><div><br></div><div><span><b>True Quips</b></span></div><div><br></div><div>Jackson: He loved the fuck out of you Sookie.</div><div><br></div><div>Pam: (about Sookie) She's like a fucking fungus that just won't go away.</div><div><br></div><div>Ginger: Eric Northman is nothing if he is not pure fucking sex on a throne.</div><div><br></div><div>Sookie: (as Bill feeds on her) It’s just lunch.</div><div><br></div><div>Pam: Ginger, look at yourself and look at me. Who has better taste?</div><div><br></div><div><span><b>Conclusion</b></span></div><div>Although it has its flaws, <b>Death Is Not The End</b> is the strongest episode of the season thus far.</div><div><br></div><div><b><span>Nad Rating</span></b></div><div><b><span><span>B+</span></span></b></div><div><br></div></div></div>";s:17:"post_image_height";i:1066;s:16:"post_image_width";i:1600;s:11:"post_visits";i:1;s:18:"post_twitterShares";i:1;s:19:"post_facebookShares";i:3;s:16:"post_totalShares";i:4;s:16:"post_socialScore";i:7;s:13:"post_virality";i:11;s:9:"blog_name";s:13:"Nad's Reviews";s:16:"blog_description";s:72:"Nad's Reviews specializes in TV reviews as well as films and restaurants";s:8:"blog_url";s:27:"http://www.nadsreviews.com/";s:11:"blog_author";s:3:"Nad";s:28:"blog_author_twitter_username";s:11:"NadsReviews";s:13:"blog_rss_feed";s:54:"http://www.nadsreviews.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss";s:9:"blog_tags";s:18:"tv, culture, media";s:2:"id";i:162;s:11:"blog_active";i:1;s:24:"blog_last_post_timestamp";i:1405593540;s:6:"col_id";N;s:8:"col_name";N;s:16:"col_media_source";N;s:13:"col_home_page";N;s:13:"col_shorthand";N;s:26:"col_media_source_shorthand";N;s:27:"col_author_twitter_username";N;s:8:"col_tags";N;s:15:"col_description";N;s:23:"col_last_post_timestamp";N;}i:11;O:8:"stdClass":36:{s:7:"post_id";i:32816;s:8:"post_url";s:77:"http://www.nadsreviews.com/2014/07/devious-maids-2x13-look-back-in-anger.html";s:10:"post_title";s:39:"Devious Maids 2x13 - Look Back In Anger";s:10:"post_image";s:108:"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-GJNf04oi1X0/U8Y__IJ3DDI/AAAAAAAAK6I/MidicR8PSsE/s1600/dm2_213_05302014_bm_0071.jpg";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:123:"Don't forget to follow Nad's Reviews on Facebook and Twitter for the latest updates.

The neighbors will be thrilled."</span></i></div><div><br></div><div>The reason I watch <i>Devious Maids </i>is simple: it reminds me of <a href="http://www.nadsreviews.com/search/label/Desperate%20Housewives">Desperate Housewives.</a> It's nowhere near as finely-crafted, nuanced or affecting, but it's a diverting slice of entertainment that hits the spot when you're in need of some brainless fun. While the show started out on the <a href="http://www.nadsreviews.com/2013/07/devious-maids-1x01-pilot.html">wrong foot</a>, it soon evolved into something <a href="http://www.nadsreviews.com/2013/09/devious-maids-1x13-totally-clean.html">pretty enjoyable</a>, and thankfully this finale kept that streak going. </div><div><br></div><div>The finale's biggest and most intriguing development was the reveal that Nick was in fact responsible for the death of Adrian and Evelyn's son. It's a twist that actually surprised me for once, and it allowed the writers to take our characters into some dark and compelling places. It's no secret that Rebecca Wisocky and Tom Irwin are two of the show's strongest performers, and they did wonders in that climactic and powerful scene that felt like it was two seasons in the making. Although I have no idea if Nick will continue to be part of the show, I'm excited to see the Powells forge a much stronger and deeper bond now that the truth is out in the open. </div><div><br></div><div>Less successful was this year's season-long arc with the gang of thugs shooting up Beverly Hills. I'm just not a fan of young actors taking up space, particularly when they're not so blessed in the acting department. However, Ty's final attack at least gave us a heck of a cliffhanger with a brutal shooting (and a bouquet of bloody roses). Here's hoping the show takes a risk and kills off a bunch of characters by the time the season three premiere comes knocking.</div><div><br></div><div><span><b>Bits from Beverly Hills</b></span></div><div><br></div><div>- I want to say I care about Spencer marrying Rosie but these two do absolutely nothing for me. Still, it was at least hilarious to watch Rosie fire Carmen, although I think the writers missed a huge opportunity here by not making Rosie her friend's boss next year. That could have been a comedy <b>goldmine</b>.</div><div><br></div><div>- Did the Powell flashback remind anyone else of <i>Desperate Housewives</i>? It felt so very Mary Alice, particularly with the creepy ethereal musical cues.</div><div><br></div><div>- Well Pablo sure is greedy with his kidneys. What will Genevieve do now? The writers better not even consider the possibility of killing off Susan Lucci. She's the show's MVP as far as I'm concerned.</div><div><br></div><div>- I like Javier, and I was really glad to see Zoila return to to him at the end. Sadly, the latter is pretty unlikeable 90 percent of the time. Echoes of Lynette Scavo here. </div><div><br></div><div>- Carmen telling the guy on the phone that he has a thick accent made me laugh. This woman genuinely feels like the heir to Eva Longoria. </div><div><br></div><div>- I think the character of Sebastian might be good for the show; Gilles Marini has an easy chemistry with Roselyn Sanchez, and I enjoyed the twist of his wife being the talent agent. </div><div><br></div><div>- What ever happened with Didi and Lucinda? That kind of fizzled out huh? I enjoyed those two immensely this year. </div><div><br></div><div>- Does Valentina's New York internship mean she'll be leaving the show for good? A guy can pray can't he?</div><div><br></div><div>- So Rosie's first husband is still alive. How predictable. </div><div><br></div><div>- Zoila's pregnant? Really? Must we suffer through a cliche who's-the-father storyline? I expect more from Marc Cherry and Eva Longoria. </div><div><br></div><div><span><b>Devious Digs</b></span></div><div><br></div><div>Zoila: Marriage is exciting inst it?</div><div>Marisol: Yeah it is. Now if you'll both excuse me I have to turn my husband in to the police. </div><div><br></div><div>Adrian: I keep wondering how in God’s name we manage to outlast so many other couples. I think it’s our sense of humor.</div><div>Evelyn: Oh, I was going to credit our high tolerance for adultery and perversion.</div><div><br></div><div>Zoila: My Pablo is giving you a kidney? He doesn't even like sharing the remote.</div><div><br></div><div>Zoila: Why do you have to be so damn wonderful?</div><div>Javier: I could get angry. Break some dishes. </div><div>Zoila: And now you're being adorable. Stop it.</div><div><br></div><div>Rosie: If there's anything at all that we can do for you, please let us know. </div><div>Carmen: I'd love to keep living here.</div><div>Rosie: So give it some thought and get back to us. </div><div><br></div><div>Piano player: I don't do heavy metal or discounts. </div><div><br></div><div>Evelyn: Maybe they even sacrificed virgins with it.</div><div>Adrian: You know me so well.</div><div><br></div><div>Adrian: I think of Valentina as a daughter.</div><div>Evelyn: Oedipus would be proud. </div><div><br></div><div><span><b>Conclusion</b></span></div><div>A witty and surprisingly ominous finale in a well-executed sophomore season. </div><div><br></div><div><span><b>Nad Rating</b></span></div><div><span><span><b>B+</b></span></span></div></div>";s:17:"post_image_height";i:1066;s:16:"post_image_width";i:1600;s:11:"post_visits";i:2;s:18:"post_twitterShares";i:1;s:19:"post_facebookShares";i:8;s:16:"post_totalShares";i:9;s:16:"post_socialScore";i:11;s:13:"post_virality";i:18;s:9:"blog_name";s:13:"Nad's Reviews";s:16:"blog_description";s:72:"Nad's Reviews specializes in TV reviews as well as films and restaurants";s:8:"blog_url";s:27:"http://www.nadsreviews.com/";s:11:"blog_author";s:3:"Nad";s:28:"blog_author_twitter_username";s:11:"NadsReviews";s:13:"blog_rss_feed";s:54:"http://www.nadsreviews.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss";s:9:"blog_tags";s:18:"tv, culture, media";s:2:"id";i:162;s:11:"blog_active";i:1;s:24:"blog_last_post_timestamp";i:1405593540;s:6:"col_id";N;s:8:"col_name";N;s:16:"col_media_source";N;s:13:"col_home_page";N;s:13:"col_shorthand";N;s:26:"col_media_source_shorthand";N;s:27:"col_author_twitter_username";N;s:8:"col_tags";N;s:15:"col_description";N;s:23:"col_last_post_timestamp";N;}i:12;O:8:"stdClass":36:{s:7:"post_id";i:32806;s:8:"post_url";s:69:"http://monkyseemonkydo.com/2014/07/16/•nate-eiesland•drifting•/";s:10:"post_title";s:30:"•Nate Eiesland•Drifting•";s:10:"post_image";s:65:"http://monkyseemonkydo.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/on_an_on_4.jpg";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:123:"Who?

I’m talking about Michael C. Hall (from the hit series “Dexter”), Don Johnson and Sam Shepard. Is “Cold in July” a great film? Far from it. But as a piece of escapism, it delivers the goods. Hall plays Richard Dane, an everyday man who shoots and kills a burglar who invades his home one night. But then the victim’s felon dad (Shepard) shows up fresh out of prison and ready for revenge. That’s the setup, which works out along familiar lines (“Cape Fear” anyone?). But what gives the movie its heat is the acting. Hall, his eyes full of fear, is exceptional. His scenes with Shepard will hook you in instantly. Jeff Grace’s eerie score may or may not remind you of John Carpenter’s “Halloween”. Either way, I suggest you give “Cold In July” a chance. Or just wait for it on DVD.</p>

Although I love blockbuster spectacles, I pretty much loathe the <i>Transformers</i> franchise. After all, action doesn't serve a purpose if the characters aren't likeable (or realistic), and that's a lesson Bay has apparently learned with his new apocalyptic drama, <i>The Last Ship</i>. Color me impressed because this is one heck of a confident and ambitious pilot.</div><div><br></div><div>With a global pandemic at its center, <i>The Last Ship</i> centers on the crew of the USS Nathan James as they struggle to find a cure. Although the premise is appropriately high-concept and mysterious, <i>Ship's</i> greatest strength lies in its fantastic leads. Eric Dane was a standout on<i> Grey's Anatomy</i>, capably balancing  humor and drama, and it's awesome to see him finally headline his own  show. As for Rhona Mitra, not only is she beyond gorgeous, but she's a  remarkably charismatic actress with a slew of memorable roles to her  name. Here's hoping she gets to kick some ass eventually (a long shot  seeing as how her character is sort of a pacifist), because the actress  has proven herself to be more than adept with physicality in the past. All in all, I'm eager to see the dynamic between Commander Tom Chandler and Dr. Rachel Scott evolve as the series progresses.</div><div><br></div><div>And now let's discuss the production values. I know Michael Bay is famous for his astounding set-pieces, but nothing could have prepared me for the incredible action on display in the pilot. Every single pulse-pounding frame is exceptionally realized, and I never once found myself taken out of the proceedings thanks to cheap CGI (I'm looking at you <i>Once Upon A Time)</i>. The cinematography does a fantastic job of creating a real sense of urgency and dread throughout.  Suffice to say,<i> The Last Ship</i> <b>looks</b> like a blockbuster film, and that's praise one can so rarely shower on a television show. </div><div><br></div><div>What excites me most about<i> The Last Ship </i>is the fact that I have absolutely no idea what the series will look like week to week. Will most of the show take place on the ship itself as our protagonists jump from point A to point B? Will there be a pit-stop in every episode? Can the show possibly sustain its momentum? I'm extremely curious to find out. </div><div><b><span><br></span></b></div><div><b><span>Conclusion</span></b></div><div>Impressive production values and fast-paced storytelling<i> </i>make<i> The Last Ship</i> pilot a thrilling affair.  </div><div><br></div><div><span><b>Nad Rating</b></span></div><div><span><span><b>A-</b></span></span></div><div><br></div></div>";s:17:"post_image_height";i:730;s:16:"post_image_width";i:1296;s:11:"post_visits";i:2;s:18:"post_twitterShares";i:1;s:19:"post_facebookShares";i:7;s:16:"post_totalShares";i:8;s:16:"post_socialScore";i:11;s:13:"post_virality";i:17;s:9:"blog_name";s:13:"Nad's Reviews";s:16:"blog_description";s:72:"Nad's Reviews specializes in TV reviews as well as films and restaurants";s:8:"blog_url";s:27:"http://www.nadsreviews.com/";s:11:"blog_author";s:3:"Nad";s:28:"blog_author_twitter_username";s:11:"NadsReviews";s:13:"blog_rss_feed";s:54:"http://www.nadsreviews.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss";s:9:"blog_tags";s:18:"tv, culture, media";s:2:"id";i:162;s:11:"blog_active";i:1;s:24:"blog_last_post_timestamp";i:1405593540;s:6:"col_id";N;s:8:"col_name";N;s:16:"col_media_source";N;s:13:"col_home_page";N;s:13:"col_shorthand";N;s:26:"col_media_source_shorthand";N;s:27:"col_author_twitter_username";N;s:8:"col_tags";N;s:15:"col_description";N;s:23:"col_last_post_timestamp";N;}i:16;O:8:"stdClass":36:{s:7:"post_id";i:32754;s:8:"post_url";s:86:"http://speaktheblues.blogspot.com/2014/07/bbc2-launches-poll-for-top-100-greatest.html";s:10:"post_title";s:56:"BBC2 Launches Poll for the Top 100 Greatest Guitar Riffs";s:10:"post_image";s:92:"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-gmYI9Nq6t7w/U8Tb3kPkOWI/AAAAAAAACtA/NrnJjCE2OnU/s1600/untitled.PNG";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:123:"Obviously you know which one I'd choose!When you hear a song, usually, especially in blues and rock, there's a recurring...";s:7:"blog_id";s:13:"speaktheblues";s:14:"post_timestamp";i:1405410360;s:12:"post_content";s:1755:"<table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-gmYI9Nq6t7w/U8Tb3kPkOWI/AAAAAAAACtA/NrnJjCE2OnU/s1600/untitled.PNG" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-gmYI9Nq6t7w/U8Tb3kPkOWI/AAAAAAAACtA/NrnJjCE2OnU/s1600/untitled.PNG" height="442" width="540"></a></td></tr><tr><td><i><b>Obviously you know which one I'd choose!</b></i></td></tr></tbody></table><div><br></div><div>When you hear a song, usually, especially in blues and rock, there's a recurring 'riff', or a repeated musical phrase that 'defines' the song.

Brushing aside the show's awkward title (Extant is apparently the opposite of Extinct), I was intrigued by Halle Berry and Steven Spielberg's involvement. After all, Berry is an Academy Award winner and the latter is a bonafide sci-fi God. After giving the show's opener a chance, I'm pleased to report that it has enough potential to warrant a 13-episode commitment.  </div><div><br></div><div><i>Extant</i> tells the story of Molly Woods, an astronaut who has just returned to Earth following a year-long mission in space. Naturally, there's a complication: she's pregnant, despite the fact that her mission was a <b>solo</b> one. The central mystery is a compelling one, and the pilot is peppered with a multitude of tantalizing questions that further complicate the narrative. Of course there's no way of predicting if the payoff will be a satisfying one, but Mickey Fisher's script paints a fascinating futuristic world that's both subtle and believable (check out the super-nifty garbage cans). There's the requisite shadowy conspiracies and government cover-ups, but they're surprisingly nowhere near as as annoying as they could have been.</div><div><br></div><div>Berry is undeniably likeable and effective as our protagonist, although the actress feels a bit too larger-than-life at times. However, I will give her the benefit of the doubt as I'm probably not used to seeing her on the small screen. Her husband played by Goran Visnjic is less impressive, which could prove  troublesome as his robotic business ventures look like they'll be  playing an integral part in the story going forward. It would do the  show good to give Camryn Manheim some juicy material in the coming  episodes. Manheim is a fantastic actor, and having her play Molly's  doctor and confidante just might make her the show's secret weapon. </div><div><br></div><div>Thankfully, the show's production values are worthy of Spielberg's legacy. The CGI touches interspersed throughout transcend the television medium, and the sequences set in space (on the Seraphim) are a highlight. Thank you <a href="http://www.nadsreviews.com/2013/09/movie-review-gravity.html">Gravity</a> for making space cool again. </div><br><div>I have to be honest, I'm a tad weary of falling for <i>Extant.</i> I'm particularly concerned over the character of Ethan (Molly's robot son), but I'll try not to judge before seeing what the writers have in store for the rest of the season. Still, the last summer series CBS produced (<a href="http://www.nadsreviews.com/2013/06/under-dome-1x01-pilot.html">Under The Dome</a>) certainly caught my attention at first with its gripping premise, but soon devolved into a mess of a show which I eventually chucked aside. Here's hoping Spielberg's involvement will be enough to stop the show from crumbling beneath its own ambitions. </div><div><br></div><div><span><b>Conclusion</b></span></div><div>An engaging pilot with fine performances and an absorbing mystery.

The British instrumental hip hop duo, who’ve been putting out material for nearly two decades now, consists of instrumentalist Jake Wherry and DJ/producer Ollie Teeba. In addition to his involvement with The Herbaliser, Teeba has produced independently for numerous MCs and is involved with a more rap-oriented side-project of his own called Soundsci.</p>
<p>On the occasion of his second visit to Lebanon for the Beirut Groove Collective’s <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/466992473437810/?ref_dashboard_filter=upcoming">first beach party of the summer</a>, in which he will be DJing, we had a talk with Mr. Teeba to get the lowdown on preferred production methods, the state of hip hop in the modern day and everything in between.</p>

<p><strong>You’ve previously played Beirut with The Herbaliser back in 2011 when you rocked DRM in Hamra. Was that your first visit to Lebanon? What was that whole experience like for you?</strong></p>
<p>Really wonderful. Many of us had never traveled to the Middle East before and really didn’t know what to expect. It was a very different experience but very pleasant indeed. We were very well looked after. Beirut is a very interesting place with its history clearly visible. We visited an area where, just in the architecture, you could see evidence of the different civilizations that had lived there throughout time.</p>
<p><strong><br>
How long have you been producing and DJing, and how did you first get into these practices? Were you a hip hop head growing up?</strong></p>
<p>Yes indeed. I first heard Hip Hop in 1981 or 82. The first records I knew were <em>The Message</em> by Grandmaster Flash and the Furious 5, <em>Buffalo Gals</em> by Malcolm McClaren and the World’s Famous Supreme Team and <em>Rockit</em> by Herbie Hancock. A short while after, I saw the movie <em>Wildstyle</em>. When I saw that, it confirmed what I wanted to do for the rest of my life. At first I was a B-boy, then started with graffiti, but once I got my first proper turntable in 1985 I got completely into scratching and mixing.</p>

<p><strong><br>
Within the Herbaliser discography, one can notice a gradual shift from the traditional sample-based hip hop sound (the debut album <em>Remedies</em>), to something much more organic with live instrumentation (like in <em>Same As It Never Was</em>) and even a fusion of both approaches (as heard in the latest album <em>There Were Seven</em>). As a producer, which of the two approaches do you prefer? And why?</strong></p>
<p>Well, the sample parts of the record are where I flex my skills at editing and arrangement. They are the bits that have more of me in them. But I love the way a sample-based track comes to life when instrumentation is added. Sometimes a sample-only track can sound a bit two-dimensional and the instruments add depth and a more human quality.</p>
<p>So, its difficult to separate the two elements particularly with The Herbaliser as that has really become it’s distinctive sound, whereas my other project Soundsci, and also my upcoming solo album, are more sample-based. They are lyrical rap records though and so a more stripped-back approach is used and the human voice creates a different vibe again, from the instrumentation.</p>
<p><strong>You contribute a whole lot of samples and scratching to the group’s sound, but do you think that old school style of instrumental hip hop and turntablism is at stake in the EDM-dominated world of today or will it always thrive regardless?</strong></p>
<p>It’s under threat from EDM. That’s kind of what <em>There Were Seven</em>, our last LP, was about. Machines completely dominating the human world. Digging for breaks and chopping them up and re-working them will only remain part of hip hop if we keep on doing it and passing that on to the younger generation. The kids of today are being completely mis-sold on what hip hop is about.</p>
<p>The stuff you hear in the mainstream has much more in common with contemporary pop music than underground hip hop. You can’t hear much difference between a rap song and Justin Bieber. However, all of this has forced more traditional forms of hip hop back underground, which to some extent has allowed us to reclaim it, since the big rap labels aren’t really interested in it any more.</p>

<p><strong><br>
You’ve worked with various rappers throughout your career, both with The Herbaliser and as a solo beatmaker. Who were some of your favorites to collaborate with? And what did each bring to the table?</strong></p>
<p>I’ve been very privileged with both The Herbaliser and Soundsci to work with some really top-drawer rap talent. They all bring with them a different magic. My favorites would be Jean Grae, Rakaa Iriscience and MF Doom.</p>
<p><strong>Speaking of rappers, your latest upcoming project is a collaboration between The Herbaliser and Canadian rap-duo Teenburger (Ghettosocks and Timbuktu). What can you tell us about this project?</strong></p>
<p>Wow. You’ve been doing your research! I first met Ghettosocks on a DJ gig I did in Halifax around 2007 (I think). I was immediately impressed with his prowess on the mic and even more by the humor in his lyrical style. Really my kind of MC. I said to him that I thought it would be good to work together at some point. So a couple of years back when he and Muneshine (of Twin Peaks) were in Europe, they laid down some tracks for <em>There Were Seven</em>.</p>
<p>We also featured Teenburger on <em>March of the Dead Things</em>, another song on that LP, and decided to bring those two degenerates, Timbuktu and Ghettosocks, on tour with us. We had such a great time, made a real connection with them and decided a more completely collaborative project needed to happen. The album is about halfway written and produced now and its going to be a funny and funky listening experience for sure.</p>

<p><strong><br>
What else do you have in store for the future, be it with The Herbaliser or solo?</strong></p>
<p>I have my own solo LP coming out this year. Its complete. It just needs mastering and artwork. A new Soundsci LP will be dropping early next year and Jake and I are about to get busy on a new top secret project very shortly. I’d tell you what it is but then I’d have to kill you haha.</p>
<p><strong><br>
What sort of material do your DJ sets usually contain and what can Beirutis expect from your upcoming one at White Beach in Batroun?</strong></p>
<p>My DJ sets are often a mixture of hip hop, mash-ups, jazzy beats and old soul and funk. I’ve been playing with Serato for the last 8 years or so but lately have been gravitating back to vinyl. I’ve been playing a lot of vinyl-only parties and they seem to bring in an audience much more receptive to the kinds of sounds I play. So, lately I’m playing 45 vinyl-only sets. These are much more soul/funk with a bit of 80s/90s hip hop. That is what I’m bringing to Beirut. I hope you have funk lovers!</p>
<p>We sure do Ollie, we sure do… Show some love for that funk and Mr. Teeba on July 19th by coming down to the Beirut Groove Collective’s<a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/466992473437810/?ref_dashboard_filter=upcoming"> first beach party of the summer</a> at White Beach in Batroun, which will feature Ollie himself as well as a handful of local talent behind the decks including DJ Spindle, Ceasar K and more.</p>
