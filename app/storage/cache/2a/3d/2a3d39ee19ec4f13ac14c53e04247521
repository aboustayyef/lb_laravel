It is the basis upon which the adventurers - who could care less for the blood of innocents - relied. It is also the weapon that Syria’s enemies in the Gulf countries and the West used. It is the weapon that Qatar and Saudi Arabia wielded, causing the death of tens of thousands of people and prompting innocent and simple-minded people to imagine a mythical event that was not even complete in the imagination of the conspirators. It also pushed a large number of people to their death. The media is something that the Syrian regime, from politicians to security officials, has failed to understand.</p><p>As the army advances on the battlefield, the behavior of people who hold this view makes clear that they still do not understand the internal reasons for the Syrian crisis. Instead of facing this weapon with its own media, the regime behaved as though what the malicious media was broadcasting was the truth. Massacres were committed and massive destruction took place in response to a manufactured image or the testimony of a foreign agent.</p><p>There is nothing harsher than the naked truth. Just like there are still people in Damascus who believe that what happened is nothing but a conspiracy, refusing to admit that there are real reasons to protest and to take to the streets demanding basic rights that have been suppressed or denied. People who hold this opinion do not want to believe that any change has happened. They represent the biggest danger today, especially if they act as though defeating the conspiracy means that everything will go back to the way things were before March 2011. </p><p>This misevaluation does exist and it manifests itself in the political, military, security and media behavior of parties and institutions from within the regime. It is the attitude of those who believe that defeating the conspiracy means that there are no problems that need to be addressed. And because that is how some people think, you see them acting arrogantly today. As the army advances on the battlefield, the behavior of people who hold this view makes clear that they still do not understand the internal reasons for the Syrian crisis. This attitude surely leads to more and more mistakes. The disaster is if opposition supporters come to be seen as traitors who deserve to be killed, exiled or displaced and their areas and homes come to be viewed as spoils of war for the victorious to plunder.</p><p>This argument has been made in different ways and at different times but to no avail. The experience of Al-Akhbar in Syria is daily proof of the crisis in the official political and media mentality in the country. What is catastrophic is what happened a few days ago when someone whose name, place of residence and position is known, decided that media representation of the battle against the armed gangs can only be done the way he sees it and that any attempt to present the battle in a way different from the image presented by the official media will be treated as an attack on Syrian sovereignty. This decision led to excluding media outlets such as al-Mayadeen and al-Manar, which are fighting with modest financial and technical resources the toughest battle with media empires hostile to Syria, and have succeeded in shattering the lies of the killers’ media and their financiers.</p><p>This decision led to excluding media outlets such as al-Mayadeen and al-Manar, which are fighting with modest financial and technical resources the toughest battle with media empires hostile to Syria.But it appears that some decision makers in Damascus may have a different point of view and of course they are entitled to their views. Syrian officials have the right to act as they see fit and in a manner that they think is best for them without being questioned or scrutinized. But something has to be said and we do not have to justify it in advance or go through the ritual of cursing the enemy to prove that it comes from a friendly position. It is an opinion that must be expressed and the decision-maker in Damascus can read it as he wishes and is obviously free to behave as he sees appropriate. </p><p>For many years, perhaps from the beginning of the Baath rule in Syria, state-run media behaves as though it has the absolute truth. No official recognizes the failure of the state media except after leaving power. No prominent or influential journalist recognizes the need for radical change except after he leaves his position. No one agrees to discuss the fact that Syria, its people and its regime need a different kind of media, media that is real and relevant not only to these time but to people’s lives. All those who have succeeded in managing this sector forget their criticism and their vision for change and get swallowed by this media machine that is the most backward in the Arab world. With its weakness and lack of influence, it can only compete with the state-run media of the Gulf countries. </p><p>When private media was finally allowed to operate, it was besieged with prohibitions. You can’t say this and you can’t talk about that and you can’t refer to this and it is forbidden to do this, that or the other. Privately-owned media soon became another version of the state-run media, unable to act or have any influence. </p><p>When Bashar al-Assad took over in 2000, there was a lot of talk of major changes in the media sector. Over the years, laws were passed - even after the outbreak of the crisis - and legislation issued that aimed at pushing the media to a level that allows it to live up to the challenges facing the country and makes room for differing opinions. Doing so would have allowed some people to resort to words instead of bullets. Alas, the Syrian media continued to dance to the same beat and the justification is always the same: No voice is louder than the voice of the battle.</p><p>The truth is, many voices are louder than the voice of the battle. The voice of the people who are tired of the sound of bullets and the dead who pave the streets and neighborhoods and the voice of those fleeing hell to a worse hell in a country of racists like Lebanon. There is a voice that is much louder and that is the voice of those seeking to reverse what is happening on the ground away from the killers who distort everything and away from idiots who are moved only by the sound of glass shattering in their homes or offices and away from false witnesses who do not want to raise their hand to object even when they are on the edge looking into the abyss.</p><p>The battle in Syria, whether it is called a civil war, a colonial invasion, an attack by the descendants of Jahiliyya or even a war of liberation, is a battle and in battle, warriors fight, but not only with bullets and bombs.The battle in Syria, whether it is called a civil war, a colonial invasion, an attack by the descendants of Jahiliyya or even a war of liberation, is a battle and in battle, warriors fight, but not only with bullets and bombs. The strongest warrior is the one who has a mind that helps him deploy the best tools of war and a heart that helps him see the people around him as innocent even as they commit suicide.</p><p>When will those in charge recognize the failure of the state-run media and admit that words have wings that no amount of prohibitions can hold back?</p><p>What needs to be said at this moment is that those in charge of the media in Syria know well that the overwhelming majority of the state-run media from TV channels, websites, newspapers and other outlets are ineffective except for the experience of the Syrian Electronic Army. Syrian decision-makers can resort to international technical tools, some of which do not require a permit to use, to understand the kind of presence that the official media has among the Syrian people, opposition and loyalists, and to realize that Syrians today, from the opposition and loyalist camps, resort to other media outlets in which they see their story. They may complain, accept, curse or understand, but they do not feel the need or the incentive to go back to the controlled media because a decades-long memory has rendered this media without credibility or at best lacking credibility. Media that only presents part of the picture even if the rest of the picture is in the interest of Syria and the regime too.</p><p>On top of that, the media has another function today, a function that is at the heart of the battle, not just the media battle but the military battle as well. There is something called psychological warfare which either serves the fighter and can grant him victory or rattles him and defeats him. Those who lack the knowledge and experience should leave this task to the professional people to do their job. Just as there is recognition, whether voluntary or involuntary, willing or unwilling, that there are fighting mechanisms that others excel at so let there be recognition, and let it be a voluntary and willing recognition, that there are those who are more capable and even more modern, bolder, more experienced and have more credibility to lead the media battle of the war.</p><p>Whoever believes today in Syria that the way the state runs the media is useful in any way is like a person who sweeps the dirt only to collect it under the rug. Whoever still believes that the strategy of prohibitions protects the country and the people should perhaps be reminded that words have wings unhindered by barriers or storms.</p><p>This article is an edited translation from the Arabic Edition.</p>";s:17:"post_image_height";i:498;s:16:"post_image_width";i:780;s:11:"post_visits";i:1528;s:18:"post_twitterShares";i:0;s:19:"post_facebookShares";i:10;s:16:"post_totalShares";i:10;s:16:"post_socialScore";i:45;s:13:"post_virality";i:15;s:9:"blog_name";N;s:16:"blog_description";N;s:8:"blog_url";N;s:11:"blog_author";N;s:28:"blog_author_twitter_username";N;s:13:"blog_rss_feed";N;s:9:"blog_tags";N;s:2:"id";N;s:11:"blog_active";N;s:24:"blog_last_post_timestamp";N;s:6:"col_id";i:5;s:8:"col_name";s:36:"Ibrahim al-Amin at Al-Akhbar English";s:16:"col_media_source";s:17:"Al-Akhbar English";s:13:"col_home_page";s:37:"http://english.al-akhbar.com/node/125";s:13:"col_shorthand";s:8:"iaminakh";s:26:"col_media_source_shorthand";s:9:"al_akhbar";s:27:"col_author_twitter_username";N;s:8:"col_tags";s:20:"columnists, politics";s:15:"col_description";s:51:"Ibrahim al-Amin is the Editor in Chief of Al-Akhbar";s:23:"col_last_post_timestamp";i:1405602652;}i:1;O:8:"stdClass":36:{s:7:"post_id";i:4717;s:8:"post_url";s:84:"http://jou3an.wordpress.com/2013/07/06/الأخوان-يدفعون-الفاتورة/";s:10:"post_title";s:44:"الأخوان يدفعون الفاتورة";s:10:"post_image";N;s:12:"post_excerpt";s:119:"خضر سلامة مطلع القرن التاسع عشر، سافر لبناني مهاجراً إلى الغرب، و";s:7:"blog_id";s:6:"jou3an";s:14:"post_timestamp";i:1373090760;s:12:"post_content";s:717:"خضر سلامة مطلع القرن التاسع عشر، سافر لبناني مهاجراً إلى الغرب، وحين توقفت باخرته في مارسيليا، قصد مطعما، ولم يكن يجيد الفرنسية، قدم النادل إليه حساء العدس مرحباً، وكون الرجل لا يفهم الفرنسية، نظر إلى زبون مجاور كان قد أنهى للتو طبق سمك، قال الزبون الفرنسي للنادل: Encore. فأحضر النادل له طبقا ثانيا من السمك.

<p>Today I have a super uber treat for all you ice cream-holics. I thank my dear friend and fellow blogger <a href="http://patymsnutritionworld.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Patricia</a> for the recipe. She made chocolate, strawberry and cashew ice cream. You can find her recipes<a href="http://patymsnutritionworld.blogspot.com/2013/05/healthy-ice-cream-strawberry-cashew-or.html" target="_blank"> here</a>. I absolutely love bananas with peanut butter so I decided to whisk it up (with of course) some chocolate! Wow the flavors knock me out.</p>
<p>So this is a healthy chocolate peanut butter ice cream recipe with absolutely no <span></span>added sugar! When I was eating it I seriously couldn’t believe it had no added sugar and I made it myself <img src="http://s0.wp.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D">  Now that’s what I call a super duper must share recipe!</p>
<p><em>Chocolate peanut butter ice cream recipe:</em></p>
<p>Ingredients (for 2 portions, or 1 person who loves his/her ice cream! But I made this for 2 and it was fantastic):</p>
<p>2 ripe bananas</p>
<p>2 tbsp low fat milk</p>
<p>1 1/2 tbsp unsweetened cocoa powder</p>
<p>1 tbsp of natural no sugar added peanut butter + 1 tsp of natural no sugar added peanut butter for garnish</p>
<p>1/4 tsp of vanilla extract</p>
<p>Method:</p>
<p>1- Cut the bananas into slices, cover and place in the freezer for about 5 hours</p>
<div><a href="http://nourishbodyandmind.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/photo-14.jpg"><img alt="Banana's before going into the freezer" src="http://nourishbodyandmind.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/photo-14.jpg?w=225&h=300" width="225" height="300"></a><p>Banana’s before going into the freezer</p></div>
<p>2- After the patient wait, place the bananas in the blender with the cocoa powder, vanilla extract and 1 tbsp peanut butter.</p>
<p>3- Pulse the mixture for a while then add 2 tsp of milk. Alternate between pulsing the mixture and adding the milk to keep the mixture going. You will have to open the blender and scrap down and mix the mixture around 5 times to get it all well blended.</p>
<p>If you like it cold, you can add some ice cubes to the mixture (not for eating!)  just to keep the temperature low. I did do this but trust me there was no time for it to melt!</p>
<p>THAT IS IT.</p>
<p>Pour it into lovely ice cream bowls. Garnish with the remaining peanut butter.</p>

<p>I haven’t made it for my nieces and nephews (I was so excited I had to post the recipe asap) yet I am certain it will be a smashing hit! I’d recommend this for all children and adults (with no nut allergies).</p>
<p>Nutrition facts (when the recipe is made for 2 so ~150 grams per person): 197 calories, 16 grams of sugar, 5 grams of fiber, 5 grams of protein</p>
<p>A great summer treat indeed. Bon appetit!</p>

<p>عندما سمعت أن الفنانة احلام سوف تكون عضواً في لجنة حكم برنامج “آراب آيدول”، عرفت من تلك اللحظة ان أن أحلام ستكون نقطة جذب كبرى في البرنامج.</p>
<p>ربما هذا الامر لان راغب علامة ونانسي عجرم لديهما اللباقة المعروفة في التعامل مع الناس ومع الصحافة وأمام الكاميرا، إلا ان لأحلام فصول متعددة مع معجبيها ومنتقديها.<br>
ولكن اليوم، تبين لي ان هناك عنصر جذب آخر للبرنامج، وهو العضو الرابع في لجنة التحكيم حسن الشافعي.</p>
<p><span></span></p>
<p>إذ استطاع حسن الشافعي ومن خلال <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ShafeiMusic" target="_blank">صفحته الرسمية على الفايسبوك </a>أن يتفوق على أحلام بأشواط، حتى مع الحلقة التي اصبحت فيها احلام مجنونة من اجل الحصول على <a href="http://youtu.be/wb854j9L3UE" target="_blank">وجبة طعام من مطعم كينتاكي</a>.</p>
<p>فمنذ دقائق، تفاجأت أن ذاك المدعو حسن الشافعي استطاع الوصول إلى قمة الإنحطاط والقذارة، ربما حتى أكثر من ما فعله “الإعلامي” <a href="http://ghazayel.wordpress.com/www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlMdFw_Z6Eg%E2%80%8E" target="_blank">وسام صباغ</a>.</p>
<p>الشافعي ومع “ابتسامة صفراء” على صفحته على الفايسبوك، نشر <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=618004394876443&set=a.391050574238494.99283.215810621762491&type=1&relevant_count=1" target="_blank">صورة “فلاير” عنوانها “مقاسات حسن الشافعي”</a>، مع شرح “إذا أردت ان تقدم هدية إلى حسن الشافعي، عليك أولاً أن تعرف الأرقام التالية:  محيط الرقبة، مقاس الخصر، الطول، الوزن، قياس القدس”</p>
<div><img alt="حسن الشافعي مقاس عضو ذكري arab idol اراب ايدول" src="http://i169.photobucket.com/albums/u203/ghazayel/1001151_618004394876443_521440455_n.jpg" width="560" height="675"><p>الصورة كما ظهرت على صفحة الشافعي</p></div>
<p>ألم يكن بإمكان الشافعي الوصول إلى إنحطاط أوسع ربما مع ذكر مقاس العضو الذكري الخاص به؟ إنه الإنحطاط نفسه!!</p>
<p>وإن ألقينا نظرة على التعليقات والمشاركات التي تلت نشر الصورة، ترى أغلبها يستهزء بالصورة، والبعض الآخر يؤكد على تفاهة وحقارة الشافعي والخطوة التي قام بها.</p>
