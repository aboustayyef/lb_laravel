The film stars Andre 3000 (of Outkast fame) as the legendary Jimi Hendrix, and while the film initially had some buzz about it, it quickly died down once it was <a href="http://www.vulture.com/2012/07/hendrix-music-for-the-andr-3000-biopic.html" target="_blank">revealed</a> that no actual music from Jimi Hendrix will be used in the film (not even as a cover version). The producers say that this is due to the film being made about Jimi's pre-fame era.</div><div><br></div><div>However, a film about a legendary musician without a hint of his music misses the point. It's like showing how Pink Floyd were created without showing off their most famous material, or even before David Gilmour joined the band. </div><div><br></div><div>The film also shows some <a href="http://mynorthwest.com/874/2526114/Did-Jimi-Hendrix-Beat-His-Girlfriend-New-Film-Says-Yes-Seattle-Biographer-Says-No" target="_blank">violence</a> against women, particularly in the character of Kathy Etchingham, who was Jimi's girlfriend. According the article, he never did beat her as shown in the film, as told by his biographer Charles Cross. </div><div><br></div><div>What we are left with is an origin story, much like all these famous Hollywood superhero movies being churned out yearly. While that is nothing too major to pick upon, but if you want to watch a movie about Hendrix, you expect to see him at full glory, concerts and Strat-burning and all, not just the periods before and at the end and missing the meat of what Jimi contributed to the music world.</div><div><br></div><div>Years ago, the movie 'Cadillac Records' was released, loosely portraying the real Chess Records of Chicago's blues fame. While they used the same names of the musicians like Muddy Waters, Chuck Berry, Howlin' Wolf etc, it was not 100% accurate, yet it was able to give us the lasting legacy.

<p><strong><span>Let me start by saying that I trust Marvel Studios. Kevin Feige has more than proven himself capable of creating a vibrant cinematic universe which serves as a brilliant extension of Marvel’s massive comics universe. Directors and studios disagree all the time, and it sometimes leads to someone walking away from the deal. It actually<a href="http://screenrant.com/marvel-thor-2-directors-patty-jenkins-branagh-rob-142991/"> happens quite a lot</a> with Marvel, with Thor: The Dark World being a recent casualty. None of this is shocking, but when it comes to Edgar Wright walking away from Ant-Man, something doesn’t really seem to make sense.</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Wright has been attached to direct Ant-Man for EIGHT YEARS. While he spent most of that time directing other films, he and Marvel studios made no secret of their desire to bring his unique vision of the character to the big screen. In a recent interview with <a href="http://www.empireonline.com/">Empire Magazine</a>, Feige even revealed that Wright’s vision for the character helped shape Marvel’s cinematic universe:<strong> </strong><em>“We changed, frankly some of the MCU to accommodate this version of Ant-Man. Knowing what we wanted to do with Edgar and with Ant-Man, going years and years back, helped to dictate what we did with the roster for Avengers the first time. It was a bit of both in terms of his idea for the Ant-Man story influencing the birth of the MCU in the early films leading up to Avengers.”</em></span></p>
<p><a href="http://ageeksblogdotcom1.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/edgar-wright-ant-man-costume-e1365011331243.jpg"><img src="http://ageeksblogdotcom1.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/edgar-wright-ant-man-costume-e1365011331243.jpg?w=650" alt="Edgar-Wright-Ant-Man-Costume-e1365011331243"></a></p>
<p><span>So what the fuck happened? Do you really mean to tell me that both parties just realized that there were “creative differences” after collaborating for eight years? I honestly don’t buy that. Rumor has it that Wright wanted his film to be more standalone, but again, how did this just come up?</span></p>
<p><span>Now you may be wondering why I’m upset. I mean, Feige has <a href="http://screenrant.com/ant-man-director-edgar-wright-exits/">already stated </a>that they’re announcing a replacement soon, and the film’s July 17, 2015 release date is still intact, and so is the cast as I far as I know. Well, the reason it’s a big deal is because Edgar Wright is a brilliant filmmaker. The man hasn’t made a single bad film, and has such a unique style that would lend itself PERFECTLY for a character like Ant-Man. Not only that, but Ant-Man was a passion project for Wright, and he’s the one who approached Feige in the first place. I loved the Comic-Con test footage (it’s online but good luck finding an HD version), and just can’t help feeling bummed out they’re not going through with this. </span></p>
<p><a href="http://ageeksblogdotcom1.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/header-kevin-feige-offers-an-update-on-marvels-ant-man-movie.jpg"><img src="http://ageeksblogdotcom1.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/header-kevin-feige-offers-an-update-on-marvels-ant-man-movie.jpg?w=650&h=272" alt="header-kevin-feige-offers-an-update-on-marvels-ant-man-movie"></a></p>
<p><span>After hearing’s Wright’s name being associated with the project for this long, how can you not be upset? My fear is that some hired-gun director is basically going to come in and try to emulate what Wright would have done so effortlessly. They also don’t have much time to play around with the script, so much of Wright’s vision should still be preserved, but why should I care if he’s not the one at the helm?  At least Marvel doesn’t have to worry about general audiences giving a shit about any of this.</span></p>
<p><span>If Wright’s name had first surfaced about a year ago in relation to the film, I wouldn’t have been that upset to hear that he left. After all, he’s a guy with a very distinct style, and him teaming up with Marvel always did seem like it was too good to be true. Problem is, they sold us a dream. Eight years of talk, and zero execution. I hope that Ant-Man ends up being an awesome movie, I genuinely do, but I can’t say I care as much anymore.</span></p>

<div></div>
<div>A disclaimer before all the Metalheads get all sensitive about metal not being soft. It is. It’s actually one of the softest genres of music out there. Notice how most of heavy metal rockstars are ‘troubled’? Exactly. But that doesn’t mean we don’t like them, we do, and we’re always here for a hug whenever metal fails to make-up for their troubling insecurities. Now let’s get to business. The following tracks are badass tracks of mastery, groove, technique, composition, and most importantly wisdom. Yes, wisdom is badass.</div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<p><strong><span>1. Jaco Pastorius/Brian Melvin- </span><span>Jazz</span><span> Street </span></strong></p>
<div></div>
<div>Dubbed the Jimi Hendrix of bass guitar, Jaco shaped what bass playing is today. Jaco can play in one song what other bassists would play in their entire life time. Yet, making it all seem so smooth and effortless. This not being his best track, however, if you want to dig deeper I suggest you check out ‘The Jaco Pastorius Anthology’.</div>

<div><strong>2. Zawinul Syndicate – Patriots</strong></div>
<div></div>
<div>Joe Zawinul was sampling sounds before sampling was cool, or even feasible. He created the concept of groove and he gathered the best musicians around him. Most importantly, he rocked.</div>
<p><span><iframe type="text/html" width="388" height="249" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/WpNjZDX0-uc?version=3&rel=1&fs=1&showsearch=0&showinfo=1&iv_load_policy=1&wmode=transparent" frameborder="0"></iframe></span></p>
<p><strong>3. Stanley Clarke – School Days</strong></p>
<div></div>
<div>The riff will rock your brains out, other than that, Stanley Clark is the trusted father of all bassists in the world and he doesn’t joke around when it comes to grooves that rock.</div>
<p><span><iframe type="text/html" width="388" height="249" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/OlcumRxBc74?version=3&rel=1&fs=1&showsearch=0&showinfo=1&iv_load_policy=1&wmode=transparent" frameborder="0"></iframe></span></p>
<p><strong>4. Dave Holland Quintet – Prime Detective</strong></p>
<div></div>
<div>Listen thoroughly and the techniques, theories and complex structure in this tune. Figure out why it’s on the list for yourself.</div>
<p><span><iframe type="text/html" width="388" height="249" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/E2qIZ-BwiE4?version=3&rel=1&fs=1&showsearch=0&showinfo=1&iv_load_policy=1&wmode=transparent" frameborder="0"></iframe></span></p>

<p><strong>5. Dave Weckl – Wake Up</strong></p>

<div>Mike Portnoy once said that the only other drummer he acknowledges is Dave Weckl.</div>

I was fascinated by its premise at first, about two vampires (Tom Hiddleston and Tilda Swinton) who’s been in love for centuries. For reasons unexplained, they now live in different parts of the world. He is isolated in an apartment in Detroit, while she lives in Tangier. Still with me? Good cause at some point you may well ask: and then what happens? The answer is “nothing much” or perhaps “nothing you can’t see coming a mile away”. For some (mainly Jarmusch devotees), this is a sign of an artistic film. But unlike those devotees, I became impatient. I knew exactly where the story was headed, yet Jarmusch and his talented actors lingered on every point, long after emptying their bag of tricks. Now don’t get me wrong, I’m all for art house films and slow, character-driven storylines. But I just couldn’t care less about any of the characters in “Only Lovers Left Alive”. I admire and respect the filmmaker’s intention, but I’m sorry to say I grew tired of his movie.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>The performance is being held in <strong>Piers 7</strong>, which has previously featured artists like Shaggy & Trey Songz. The open air venue will surely make a great place to host one of the biggest names in hiphop and RnB today.</p>

<p><span><strong>With “<a href="http://ageeksblog.com/2014/05/21/movie-review-x-men-days-of-future-past-2014/">X-Men: Days of Future Past</a>” making its way to theaters this weekend, there’s no better time to look back at the X-Men franchise and rank each individual film. With seven movies in 14 years, there’s certainly no shortage of X-Men adventures to choose from:</strong></span></p>
<h3><span>7. X-Men Origins: Wolverine (2009)</span></h3>
<p><a href="http://ageeksblogdotcom1.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/x-men-origins-wolverine-1024.jpg"><img src="http://ageeksblogdotcom1.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/x-men-origins-wolverine-1024.jpg?w=650&h=364" alt="x-men-origins-wolverine-1024"></a></p>
<p><span>This one’s obvious. This movie did to Wolverine what the Star Wars prequels did to Darth Vader, which is to completely shit on his backstory. It doesn’t matter how good Hugh Jackman is in the role; nothing could save this movie from the bloated tragedy that it was. Fox was throwing in random mutants in hopes of landing spinoffs, and they completely butchered Deadpool. Even the effects were a step backwards for the series. I can go on and on. Complete garbage.</span></p>
<h3><span>6. X-Men: The Last Stand (2006)</span></h3>
<p><a href="http://ageeksblogdotcom1.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/xmen3.jpg"><img src="http://ageeksblogdotcom1.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/xmen3.jpg?w=650&h=363" alt="xmen3"></a></p>
<p><span>I honestly don’t hate this as much as a lot of people do, but that’s not to say I particularly like it. The Phoenix story arc was botched (to say the least), and so was Cyclop’s offscreen death, Professor Xavier’s death, not to mention Mystique getting cured (I don’t blame Rogue for getting cured…her power sucks) and Angel barely showing up for five minutes in the film. Also, there was that one mutant with spikes who had to hug people to kill them…terrible. We can at least be thankful Brett Ratner has nothing to do with this franchise anymore.</span></p>
<h3><span>5. The Wolverine (2013)</span></h3>
<p><a href="http://ageeksblogdotcom1.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/the-wolverine.jpg"><img src="http://ageeksblogdotcom1.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/the-wolverine.jpg?w=650&h=411" alt="The-Wolverine"></a></p>
<p><span>I actually really enjoyed “The Wolverine.” For one, it was much, much better than “Origins,” and it managed to put Wolverine’s solo franchise back on track. I’ll admit that the film’s climax was supremely stupid and silly when compared to the relatively more somber latter half, but I still enjoyed it overall. We also quite possibly get Jackman’s most layered performance as Wolverine to date.</span></p>
<h3><span>4. X-Men (2000)</span></h3>
<p><a href="http://ageeksblogdotcom1.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/goodguys.jpg"><img src="http://ageeksblogdotcom1.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/goodguys.jpg?w=650&h=364" alt="goodguys"></a></p>
<p><span>Bryan Singer’s original “X-Men” still holds up as a great comic book film. I know a lot of fans take issue with the film series’ many deviations from the comics, but you need to remember that the superhero movie landscape was quite different in 2000. The X-Men had to be palatable for general audiences not acquainted with the comic books, so some sacrifices had to be made. But it was a thoroughly entertaining and engaging film that helped establish superhero movies as viable blockbusters, and kicked off a prolific and enduring franchise in the process.</span></p>
<h3><span>3. X-Men: First Class (2011)</span></h3>
<p><a href="http://ageeksblogdotcom1.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/line-up.jpg"><img src="http://ageeksblogdotcom1.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/line-up.jpg?w=650&h=406" alt="Line Up"></a></p>
<p><span>“First Class” saved the X-Men franchise. After Brett Ratner and Gavin Hood took their respective shits on the series with “The Last Stand” and “Origins: Wolverine,” Matthew Vaughn was able to regain the audience’s trust with a fresher take on the characters. With a 60′s setting and younger versions of many fan favorite characters, the film struck a cord with critics and audiences alike, and paved the way for the X-Men’s most epic adventure yet.</span></p>
<h3><span>2. X2: X-Men United (2003)</span></h3>
<p><a href="http://ageeksblogdotcom1.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/42.jpg"><img src="http://ageeksblogdotcom1.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/42.jpg?w=650&h=432" alt="42"></a></p>
<p><span>I’d still consider X2 as one of the best comic book films made ever since the genre really took off. The film was darker than its predecessor and delved deeper into Wolverine’s mysterious past. The Nighcrawler White House attack is probably still one of the coolest opening scenes in any film. It ended with such great promise, which is what makes “The Last Stand” such a big disappointment. </span></p>
<h3><span>1. X-Men: Days of Future Past (2014)</span></h3>
<p><a href="http://ageeksblogdotcom1.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/xmen-days-of-future-past-james-mcavoy-hugh-jackman-nicholas-hoult1.jpg"><img src="http://ageeksblogdotcom1.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/xmen-days-of-future-past-james-mcavoy-hugh-jackman-nicholas-hoult1.jpg?w=650&h=432" alt="xmen-days-of-future-past-james-mcavoy-hugh-jackman-nicholas-hoult"></a></p>
<p><span>I couldn’t be happier to report that Bryan Singer’s “<a href="http://ageeksblog.com/2014/05/21/movie-review-x-men-days-of-future-past-2014/">Days of Future Past</a>” is hands down the best X-Men film to date. Not only does it manage to bring together two massive casts, but it does so in a highly entertaining and enthralling way. It’s a throwback to everything we love about the franchise, and it’s up there with some of the best superhero flicks of all time. </span></p>

However, their blowout this week was all the more uncomfortable and impactful seeing as how the two hadn't been at each other's throats in years. It genuinely felt like watching two old friends lashing out in the most hurtful way possible, and it has me wondering how Alicia will ever be able to fully trust Carey again (especially after he went to Canning in his attempts to sabotage the merge). Quite fascinatingly, their clash culminated in Diane basically offering herself up to Florrick/Agos (alongside her $36 billion in client billings). I'd been awaiting this moment for far too long, and it did <b>not </b>disappoint. In fact, it felt like a natural step in the show's evolution. </div><div><br></div><div>Much like the NSA spied on our cast of characters all year long, this season came full circle with Florrick/Agos surveying Lockhart/Gardner thanks to a forgotten webcam. This development was both riveting (Alicia watching David and Canning discussing her takedown) and comedic (the crew catching a couple having sex in the conference room). But of course the real highlight was Carey witnessing Diane brag of Kalinda's exploitation of him; that sequence was tremendously harsh, punctuated by the presence of Alicia and the rest of the team. Ouch.  </div><div><br></div><div>Interestingly, in the midst of all the chaos, this explosive finale still had time to explore Alicia's family life. <b>A Weird Year </b>was peppered with instances of people commenting on Alicia's "empty nest" syndrome, finally culminating with the remarkbely moving scene in which Alicia rushed and thankfully made it to Zack's graduation. Naturally the writers had to break our hearts by showing Alicia all alone in Zack's room the night he moved out. Truth be told, it's an inspired decision as the Florrick kids always were the weakest part of the show. One down, one to go. </div><div><br></div><div>And what of the final scene? Utter perfection. Alicia and Eli catch a breather on the dinner table with a glass of wine, when Eli (quite awesomely) comes to the hilarious and fitting realization that Alicia should run for State's Attorney. Margulies' reaction is epic, and it's a brilliant note to bookend the season on. Honestly I've always kind of wanted Alicia to end the show in a position of true power, so it would be a great thematic resolution to the entire show's legacy to have her run for office. I'm beyond pumped to see how the writers explore this potential development next season. God knows that Robert and Michelle King have cemented themselves as storytelling geniuses when it comes to mapping out Alicia Florrick's immensely absorbing journey.  </div><div><br></div><div><span><b>Bits & Cases</b></span></div><div><br></div><div>- Loved the chaotic feel with Alicia juggling phone calls including Veronica and that darn lasagna. </div><div><br></div><div>- I can not emphasize how much I <b>love</b> Howard Lyman. His cross-examination of Alicia was hysterical - "The Indian council" was a particular hoot, as was the take-out menu xerox. </div><div><br></div><div>- Although Finn got thrown out of the State's Attorney race, I'm curious to see his dynamic further evolve with Alicia next year. </div><div><br></div><div>- As always, Christina Baranski delivered stellar work this week. Her disappointment with Peter yet <b>again</b> denying her the Supreme Court Justice position was palpable, and her resolve to crawl her way out of her predicament at the end was empowering. </div><div><br></div><div>- How sneaky was Florrick/Agos' plan to send Alicia personally to LG so they could overhear their reaction afterwards? And Alicia using Will's office as an "excuse" to stay in the room? A superb demonstration of Alicia's growth and strength.</div><div><br></div><div>- Further proof that this hour was incredible: Jackie and Veronica were utilized to hilarious effect. I absolutely loved watching Peter and Alicia's moms butt heads throughout the dinner preparations. And Jackie calling Veronica a bitch? Priceless. </div><div><br></div><div>- Recurring element that always amuses me: the fact that Florrick/Agos has no walls and doors. </div><div><br></div><div>- Carey insinuating that Alicia's is still greatly affected by Will was quite powerful. </div><div><br></div><div>-  Although I'm never been Kalinda's biggest fan, she's definitely her best when she's supporting Diane through thick and thin. The less said about her slightly-rapey scene with Carey in bed the better.</div><div><br></div><div>- I've wanted Diane to jump ship for a while now, so it's going to be frustrating if she joins and Alicia leaves to run for office. I <b>really</b> want to see the three working together again. </div><div><br></div><div><span><b>Good Lines</b></span></div><div><br></div><div>Jackie: I see where Alicia's drinking comes from.</div><div>Veronika: And Peter's rudeness.</div><div><br></div><div>Carey: God I am the new Will. (Alicia looks at him) Sorry. </div><div><br></div><div>Alicia: It's been a weird day.</div><div>Eli: A weird year.</div><div><br></div><div><span><b>Conclusion</b></span></div><div>This was an astonishing example of <i>The Good Wife</i> firing on all cylinders. Magnificent stuff.</div><div><br></div><div><span><b>Nad Rating</b></span></div><div><span><span><b>A+</b></span></span></div><div><br></div></div>";s:17:"post_image_height";i:673;s:16:"post_image_width";i:1012;s:11:"post_visits";i:3;s:18:"post_twitterShares";i:2;s:19:"post_facebookShares";i:10;s:16:"post_totalShares";i:12;s:16:"post_socialScore";i:13;s:13:"post_virality";i:20;s:9:"blog_name";s:13:"Nad's Reviews";s:16:"blog_description";s:72:"Nad's Reviews specializes in TV reviews as well as films and restaurants";s:8:"blog_url";s:27:"http://www.nadsreviews.com/";s:11:"blog_author";s:3:"Nad";s:28:"blog_author_twitter_username";s:11:"NadsReviews";s:13:"blog_rss_feed";s:54:"http://www.nadsreviews.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss";s:9:"blog_tags";s:18:"tv, culture, media";s:2:"id";i:162;s:11:"blog_active";i:1;s:24:"blog_last_post_timestamp";i:1401652500;}i:15;O:8:"stdClass":26:{s:7:"post_id";i:30026;s:8:"post_url";s:83:"http://speaktheblues.blogspot.com/2014/05/blues-sketch-on-in-living-color-with.html";s:10:"post_title";s:50:"Blues Sketch on 'In Living Color' (with Jim Carey)";s:10:"post_image";s:66:"http://images.sodahead.com/polls/001580747/447219568_0_xlarge.jpeg";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:123:"In Living Color was a comedy sketch show back in the early 1990's and featured the young Jim Carey, Jamie Foxx, the Waya...";s:7:"blog_id";s:13:"speaktheblues";s:14:"post_timestamp";i:1400751660;s:12:"post_content";s:824:"<div><a href="http://images.sodahead.com/polls/001580747/447219568_0_xlarge.jpeg" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" src="http://images.sodahead.com/polls/001580747/447219568_0_xlarge.jpeg" height="298" width="400"></a></div><br><br>In Living Color was a comedy sketch show back in the early 1990's and featured the young Jim Carey, Jamie Foxx, the Wayans brothers and many more.<br><br>Here's one sketch about a fictional bluesman named Calhoun Tubbs (played by <span>David Alan Grier)</span> trying to teach Jim Carey's character (with a bad English accent) about the blues.

Snow</b></span></span><br>An emotionally driven episode, <b>Mockingbird</b> may not have been as action driven but I sure enjoyed it nonetheless. The writing on this show never ceases to amaze me even in the slower episodes.  <br><br>The episode jumped around multiple storylines catching us up with all the characters and by all, I mean <b>all</b>. Two characters we hadn’t seen since seasons two and three showed up. One was Hot Pie, Arya’s friend who stayed behind at the bakery, the other was one of the prisoners who wanted to kill Arya in season two. Arya kills him without flinching…girl needs a therapist.<br><br>Peter Dinklage yet again blew me away in every scene he was in. The moment with him and Oberyn was beautifully written and acted. <br><br>Many <i>GOT </i> fans have been whining about nudity equality on the show, so no more whining after this episode. The Red Woman was naked, and Danaerys ordered Daario Naharis to drop his trousers (anyone else catch Danaerys’s eye shift?)<br><br>The last sequence at the Eyrie was just the cherry on top of the ice cream. Just when you thought Peter Baelish (Littlefinger) couldn’t get any darker and twisted, he kisses Sansa and murders his wife by making her fly via moon door. <br><br><span><b>Slices of Westeros</b></span><br><br>- Oberyn as Tyrion’s champion. Can’t wait to see the fight!<br><br>- The Dire-Wolf cookie for Arya from Hot Pie. It was a nice throwback. <br><br>- Murder at the Eyrie! Seriously epic kill, if this was <i>Mortal Kombat, </i>it would be a Flawless Victory.<br><br><span><b>Kingly Exchanges</b></span><br><br>Danaerys Targaryen: (to Sir Jorah) They can live in my new world or they can die in their old one.<br><br>Oberyn: (to Tyrion): I will be your champion.<br><br>Arya: (to Dying Man) Nothing isn’t better or worse than anything. Nothing is just nothing.<br><br><span><b>Conclusion</b></span><br>Though this episode may seem lackluster compared to the one that came before, it still contains a number of key foreshadowing moments for upcoming episodes. We are now two episodes away from the finale and things are <b>really </b>heating up. <br><br><span><b>A. Snow Rating</b></span><br><span><span><b>A-</b></span></span></div></div>";s:17:"post_image_height";i:1064;s:16:"post_image_width";i:1600;s:11:"post_visits";i:7;s:18:"post_twitterShares";i:0;s:19:"post_facebookShares";i:8;s:16:"post_totalShares";i:8;s:16:"post_socialScore";i:16;s:13:"post_virality";i:17;s:9:"blog_name";s:13:"Nad's Reviews";s:16:"blog_description";s:72:"Nad's Reviews specializes in TV reviews as well as films and restaurants";s:8:"blog_url";s:27:"http://www.nadsreviews.com/";s:11:"blog_author";s:3:"Nad";s:28:"blog_author_twitter_username";s:11:"NadsReviews";s:13:"blog_rss_feed";s:54:"http://www.nadsreviews.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss";s:9:"blog_tags";s:18:"tv, culture, media";s:2:"id";i:162;s:11:"blog_active";i:1;s:24:"blog_last_post_timestamp";i:1401652500;}i:17;O:8:"stdClass":26:{s:7:"post_id";i:29917;s:8:"post_url";s:74:"http://www.nadsreviews.com/2014/05/suburgatory-3x13-stiiiiiiill-horny.html";s:10:"post_title";s:52:"Suburgatory 3x13 - Stiiiiiiill Horny (Series Finale)";s:10:"post_image";s:132:"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-3xfNlES8DQw/U3xngc3B8UI/AAAAAAAAKwM/FTEgj_OG5ok/s1600/parker-young-jane-levy-suburgatory-series-finale.jpg";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:123:"Don't forget to follow Nad's Reviews on Facebook and Twitter for the latest updates."This is why people don't have their...";s:7:"blog_id";s:11:"nadsreviews";s:14:"post_timestamp";i:1400662620;s:12:"post_content";s:4986:"<div dir="ltr" trbidi="on"><div><span><span><b><span><b><span><b><span>Don't forget to follow<span> Nad's Reviews </span>on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/NadsReviews">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/NadsReviews">Twitter</a> for the latest updates.</span></b></span></b></span></b></span></span></div><div dir="ltr" trbidi="on"><div><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-3xfNlES8DQw/U3xngc3B8UI/AAAAAAAAKwM/FTEgj_OG5ok/s1600/parker-young-jane-levy-suburgatory-series-finale.jpg" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-3xfNlES8DQw/U3xngc3B8UI/AAAAAAAAKwM/FTEgj_OG5ok/s1600/parker-young-jane-levy-suburgatory-series-finale.jpg" height="225" width="400"></a></div><i><span>"This is why people don't have their weddings on a school night."</span></i><br><br>When I fall in love with a show, it becomes a huge part of my life; I live and breathe the characters and their adventures week after week. That's why it's particularly brutal when a show I adore gets cancelled <b>way</b> before its time. If this is indeed the end for <i>Suburgatory</i> (there are rumors that the show is being shopped around to other networks but I doubt anything will materialize), then this was certainly an unsatisfying series finale. <br><br>Let's start with George and Dallas, the show's core couple. I've been an ardent fan of their relationship since the show's inception, so imagine my sheer and utter disappointment when the finale didn't bring their journey to a close. Surely the writers had a feeling that <i>Suburgatory</i> would not get renewed thanks to its dwindling ratings? Instead we're left with the two broken up, and George unwilling to admit how much he wants to be with the love of his life. While Jeremy Sisto and Cheryl Hines's performances were as exceptional as always, it's a pity that we have absolutely no closure where these two are concerned. Writers, you dropped the ball here and I'm beyond heartbroken. <br><br>Honestly, I never bought Tessa's love for Ryan Shay. The latter was always a frustrating imbecile of a character, and I always felt Tessa deserved better. Nevertheless, the finale's end sequence at least somewhat works as a thematic sendoff: Tessa finally fires back against Chatswin's suburban restraints and practically has sex in the middle of a crowded street (as the rest of the cast watches on). It's an admittedly memorable moment which somehow softens the blow of the show's unjust cancellation (or maybe I'm just in denial).  <br><br>I think the aspect that I'll miss most about the show is its extraordinary cast. Each and every one of Chatswin's characters was so perfectly drawn and realized, coming together to craft a wonderfully whacky cartoon world. Look no further than Carly Chaikin and her phenomenal performance as Dalia Royce over the course of three seasons. The girl injected a stereotypical bimbo with just the right dose of gravitas and stone-cold zingers. And what of the Shays? I would pay to watch Shiela and Fred Shay in their own nutty spinoff. Even during its weakest hours, both Ana Gasteyer and Chris Parnell kept <i>Suburgatory</i> afloat with hilarity and nuance. <br><br><span><b>Pickets & Fences</b></span><br><br>- I was never the biggest fan of Lisa and Malik, but their wedding in the penultimate episode of the season was marvelous. Plus, it was a great showcase for Dahlia who was horribly underutilized in this finale. Why God why?<br><br>- Perfect example of <i>Suburgatory</i>'s eccentric and whimsical world: George's hilarious dream with a naked Dallas sitting on his lap and pouring sugar all over herself. <br><br>- Through it all, Jane Levy has been an incredible Tessa. I'm positive this girl is going to have a brilliant future in Hollywood. <br><br>- The old ladies in Tessa's knitting circle were enormously amusing.<br><br>- George singing a song about Dallas in the bar kind of bored me to tears.<br><br>- My favorite moment of the hour? Sheila begging George to sing again so she could Shazam his song. I swear I almost died.<br><br><b><span>Slices of Suburbia</span></b><br><br>Dahlia: Poor mommy. I know how you feel; my mouth almost hooked up with a piece of wedding cake but luckily I pulled out at the last minute.<br><br>George: (to Fred) You have children so I know you've been with a woman, but I gotta say... it sounds like you haven't. <br><br>Boy: You could have mentioned that a little earlier before I wasted my Saturday night and 50 bucks.<br>Tessa: I ordered a side salad.<br>Boy: You added chicken!<br><br><span><b>Conclusion</b></span><br>As a season finale, this episode was a somewhat entertaining outing. But as a series finale, it was far from satisfying. However, it must be acknowledged that few comedies were <b>ever </b>as ambitious and witty as <i>Suburgatory</i>. Chatswin you were truly something special, and you <b>will</b> be greatly missed. <br><br><span><b>Nad Rating</b></span><br><span><span><b>B-</b></span></span><br><br></div></div>";s:17:"post_image_height";i:422;s:16:"post_image_width";i:750;s:11:"post_visits";i:4;s:18:"post_twitterShares";i:1;s:19:"post_facebookShares";i:4;s:16:"post_totalShares";i:5;s:16:"post_socialScore";i:11;s:13:"post_virality";i:13;s:9:"blog_name";s:13:"Nad's Reviews";s:16:"blog_description";s:72:"Nad's Reviews specializes in TV reviews as well as films and restaurants";s:8:"blog_url";s:27:"http://www.nadsreviews.com/";s:11:"blog_author";s:3:"Nad";s:28:"blog_author_twitter_username";s:11:"NadsReviews";s:13:"blog_rss_feed";s:54:"http://www.nadsreviews.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss";s:9:"blog_tags";s:18:"tv, culture, media";s:2:"id";i:162;s:11:"blog_active";i:1;s:24:"blog_last_post_timestamp";i:1401652500;}i:18;O:8:"stdClass":26:{s:7:"post_id";i:29933;s:8:"post_url";s:51:"http://musiqati.com/2014/05/21/m83-wait-kygo-remix/";s:10:"post_title";s:25:"M83 – Wait (Kygo Remix)";s:10:"post_image";s:43:"http://img.youtube.com/vi/_Ueq2RKhrv0/0.jpg";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:57:"Tagged: kygo, melow, mrrevillz, summer 2014, summer music";s:7:"blog_id";s:8:"musiqati";s:14:"post_timestamp";i:1400659800;s:12:"post_content";s:876:"<p><span><iframe type="text/html" width="500" height="312" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/_Ueq2RKhrv0?version=3&rel=1&fs=1&showsearch=0&showinfo=1&iv_load_policy=1&wmode=transparent" frameborder="0"></iframe></span></p><br> Tagged: <a href="http://musiqati.com/tag/kygo/">kygo</a>, <a href="http://musiqati.com/tag/melow/">melow</a>, <a href="http://musiqati.com/tag/mrrevillz/">mrrevillz</a>, <a href="http://musiqati.com/tag/summer-2014/">summer 2014</a>, <a href="http://musiqati.com/tag/summer-music/">summer music</a> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/musiqati.wordpress.com/1224/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/musiqati.wordpress.com/1224/"></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=musiqati.com&blog=32117344&post=1224&subd=musiqati&ref=&feed=1" width="1" height="1">";s:17:"post_image_height";i:360;s:16:"post_image_width";i:480;s:11:"post_visits";i:2;s:18:"post_twitterShares";i:3;s:19:"post_facebookShares";i:1;s:16:"post_totalShares";i:4;s:16:"post_socialScore";i:8;s:13:"post_virality";i:11;s:9:"blog_name";s:8:"Musiqati";s:16:"blog_description";s:123:"The combination of vocal and/or instrumental sounds producing a beauty of form, harmony and emotional expression (by Amira)";s:8:"blog_url";s:29:"http://musiqati.wordpress.com";s:11:"blog_author";s:7:"Amira A";s:28:"blog_author_twitter_username";s:8:"musiqati";s:13:"blog_rss_feed";s:35:"http://musiqati.wordpress.com/feed/";s:9:"blog_tags";s:21:"music, society, media";s:2:"id";i:95;s:11:"blog_active";i:1;s:24:"blog_last_post_timestamp";i:1401719400;}i:19;O:8:"stdClass":26:{s:7:"post_id";i:29909;s:8:"post_url";s:83:"http://speaktheblues.blogspot.com/2014/05/block-party-in-nyc-celebrating-miles.html";s:10:"post_title";s:48:"Block Party in NYC Celebrating 'Miles Davis Way'";s:10:"post_image";s:104:"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-KkbdRhK8YlM/U3xQJnvzA2I/AAAAAAAACnE/CJILhDFCXQI/s1600/140520_milesdavisway.jpg";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:123:"A few month back I posted that New York City's 312 West 77th Street will now be renamed 'Miles Davis Way'.

<p><span><strong>The very first X-Men movie came out 14 years ago. Directed by Bryan Singer, it was Marvel’s first legitimate blockbuster, and introduced audiences the world over to iconic characters such as Wolverine, Magneto, and Professor Xavier. “X2: X-Men United” was an exemplary sequel, and is still considered by many as one of the best superhero movies ever made. Unfortunately, things became a little shaky after X2. Following Singer’s abrupt departure from the franchise, Brett Ratner stepped in to helm “X-Men: The Last Stand,” and we all know how awful that turned out. If that wasn’t bad enough, 2009′s “X-Men Origins: Wolverine”  was so bad that it risked derailing the franchise for good, until Matthew Vaughn’s excellent “X-Men: First Class” brought our favorite mutants roaring back. Well folks, it only took 14 years, but we now have our definitive X-Men flick. Not only is “Days of Future Past” the best X-Men movie to date, but it’s the best movie of the year (so far), and one of the greatest and most ambitious comic book films ever made. Welcome back Bryan Singer; you were sorely missed.</strong></span></p>
<p><span>Loosely based off of the seminal “<a href="http://ageeksblog.com/2014/04/16/comic-book-review-x-men-days-of-future-past/">Days of Future Past</a>” story arc, the film opens with a glimpse into an apocalyptic future where mutants – and humans sympathetic to their cause – are ruthlessly hunted down and killed by an army of Sentinels; giant mutant-killing robots. Desperate to try and avoid this grim reality, Professor Xavier (Patrick Stewart), along with Magneto (Ian McKellen), devise a plan to use Kitty Pride’s (Ellen Page) powers to send Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) back in time to stop Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence) from murdering Sentinel-creator Bolivar Trask (Peter Dinklage), an event that directly led to this dystopian future. It’s up to Wolverine to convince young Xavier (James McAvoy) and young Magneto (Michael Fassbender) to put their differences aside and work together in preventing the murder of Mr. Trask, or else their future is doomed.</span></p>

<p><span>I absolutely adored this movie. For one, it’s awesome to have Bryan Singer back in his comfort zone. It’s clear that the director feels right at home with these characters, and I honestly felt right at home too. From familiar sets to familiar faces, “X-Men: Days of Future Past” is a love letter to X-Men fans, and more importantly, to audiences that grew up with this franchise. I was 10 when I first saw Jackman as Wolverine. I’m almost 24 now. The film also boasts what could be one of the greatest casts ever assembled for any movie, period. From living legends like Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen to up and coming superstars like Michael Fassbender, Jennifer Lawrence, and Peter Dinklage, this is seriously a once-in-a-lifetime cast, and they all knock it out of the park.</span></p>
<p><span>I’m trying my best to find something to complain about, but as you can tell, Im struggling. I loved everything about this movie. Scenes taking place in the future are moody and grim, and can get pretty violent, even downright scary at times. The 70′s setting also worked incredibly well for me. Seeing Wolverine and Professor X in bell-bottoms is priceless, and the entire film is sprinkled with lighter moments and amusing 70′s references.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://ageeksblogdotcom1.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/xmen-days-of-future-past-james-mcavoy-hugh-jackman-nicholas-hoult.jpg"><img src="http://ageeksblogdotcom1.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/xmen-days-of-future-past-james-mcavoy-hugh-jackman-nicholas-hoult.jpg?w=650&h=432" alt="xmen-days-of-future-past-james-mcavoy-hugh-jackman-nicholas-hoult"></a></p>
<p><span>Perhaps most importantly, though, “Days of Future Past” uses its time travel elements to “fix” the X-Men cinematic universe and right some wrongs. Does that mean that “The Last Stand” and “Origins: Wolverine” are suddenly good movies? Fuck no. It just means that some of the bullshit they introduced no longer matters. I won’t spoil any of it here, but know that you’ll find it really, really difficult to stop smiling for about an hour after the movie ends. It’s that good. </span></p>
<p><span>Besides the spectacular action and humor, DOFP also has a lot of heart. Sure, Wolverine’s all over the posters, but this is young Xavier’s story first and foremost, and James McAvoy delivers a tour-de-force performance as a broken and fragile shell of his former self. He’s not the man we once knew, and having Wolverine mentor him is a perfectly fitting arc for these characters, considering all they’re been through together. And I must say, Hugh Jackman once again kills it as Wolverine. The day he hangs up his claws will be a sad one indeed, even though he’s definitely earned his retirement at this point. Again, the entire cast is on point, including Ian McKellen and Fassbender, but one character almost threatens to walk away with the entire movie: Quicksilver, who’s played by Evan Peters. His scenes are so thoroughly entertaining that you’ll wish he had more to do. Same goes for Omar Sy as Bishop; he’s awesome when we do see him, but I would have sure loved to see more of him.</span></p>

<p><span><strong>The Verdict:</strong></span></p>
<p><span>“X-Men: Days of Future Past” is better than I could have even hoped. I walked out of the theater with a massive grin on my face, and a desperate desire to watch it again. I can’t wait to see where the series goes from here, but I have every reason to be optimistic. Welcome back Bryan Singer; you were sorely missed.</span></p>

It is vastly superior to all the previous installments, and not just because it draws on one of the most admired stories in the series. Screenwriter Simon Kinberg has used the time travel concept as a springboard for brand new ideas and has infused his work with a bracing sense of humor. And in the hands of director Brian Singer (who directed the first two films), the series still feels fresh and vibrant, even after all these years. As icing on the cake, the movie provides a great role for Peter Dinklage (Game of Thrones’ MVP), who knocks it out of the park. There’s never a sense of “been there done that” here, making it one of the best comic book sequels ever made. One of the writer’s most impressive feats is dealing with the time travel concept without leaving room for plot holes, which he does with extraordinary skill. The movie opens in the future, and it’s a very dark future. An army of killer robots known as Sentinels is wiping out all mutants, leaving professor Charles Xavier (the great Patrick Stewart) and his longtime friend/enemy, Magneto (Ian McKellen) with no choice…except to send Logan/Wolverine (Hugh Jackman, never better) back to the year 1973 in order to undo certain key events and change the future. That would require him to meet the younger version of Xavier and Magneto (James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender, both dynamite). I’m deliberately being vague about the details because, having read nothing about the story, it all came as a surprise, and I loved every second of it. But I can tell you that the action scenes are brilliantly staged and very exciting to watch. Whether it’s Wolverine doing what he does best or spectacular visual effects driven showdowns, director Brian Singer does an excellent job and never loses sight of the emotional stakes at every turn. The cast couldn’t be better, with Jackman, McAvoy, Fassbender, Halle Berry, Jennifer Lawrence, Nicholas Hoult and Ellen Page delivering the goods from start to finish. But there’s particular pleasure in watching Emmy Award winner Peter Dinklage tackle a role he was probably born to play. I’ll say no more, except that “Days of Future Past” is blockbuster entertainment at its best. Just let it work its magic; you won’t be disappointed.</p>

<p><strong><span>“</span><span><a href="http://ageeksblog.com/2014/05/13/movie-review-godzilla-2014/">Godzilla</a></span><span>” has taken over the global box office, and that also includes Lebanon. The movie scored 18,625 admissions;  the year’s fourth biggest local opening behind “300: Rise of an Empire” “The Amazing Spider-Man 2″ and “Noah.” </span></strong></p>
<p><span>Despite strong initial reviews, word of mouth has been mostly mixed for the film, and when combined with the arrival of the X-Men, it could lead to a sizable drop next weekend. Still, a “Godzilla” sequel has already been green-lit, so WB has plenty to be happy about. This is by all means a monster hit (pun definitely intended). </span></p>
<p>“<span><a href="http://tlkabtmovies.com/2014/05/15/grace-of-monaco-2014/">Grace of Monaco</a></span>,<span>” which stars Nicole Kidman as Grace Kelly, opened to pretty strong numbers in second place despite getting some of the year’s worst reviews. The film sold 7,824 tickets, which should likely plummet next weekend due to poor word of mouth.</span></p>
<p><span>“</span><span><a href="http://ageeksblog.com/2014/04/29/movie-review-the-amazing-spider-man-2-2014/">The Amazing Spider-Man 2</a></span><span>” suffered a great deal from Godzilla’s arrival, as the film dropped 62% to 5,998 admissions for the weekend. To date, the film has sold 50,741 tickets, and should probably end up with around 60K.</span></p>
<p><span>“</span><span><a href="http://ageeksblog.com/2014/04/17/movie-review-neighbors-2014/">Neighbors</a></span><span>” ended up in fourth place with 5,177 admissions, a 53% drop from last week. Its total now stands at 16,128. “</span><span><a href="http://ageeksblog.com/2014/04/25/movie-review-the-other-woman-2014/">The Other Woman</a></span><span>” continued its impressive run and had the second lowest drop in the top 10. The film dipped by 48% to fifth place with 3,797 admissions for a total of 34,939. Never underestimate the power of a female led film in a summer full of male-oriented stuff. </span></p>
<p><span>The only other notable release of the week was “Justin and the Knights of Valour,” which totally bombed with 616 admissions. It landed in ninth place. </span></p>

Indeed, he was in Muddy Waters' band from 1952 until 1968... in the blues world that's almost a lifetime, as many session players would often leave a band to pursue solo efforts. Muddy Waters always chose the best of the best to play in his band, and he also encouraged them to find their own success. </div><div><br></div><div>Otis Spann, called a brother by Muddy, was the leading blues pianist of his time. His unique playing and soulful voice propelled him to the top of the pack very quickly, and he is included on many of the classic blues standards of the 50's and 60's. He released his first solo <a href="http://speaktheblues.blogspot.com/2012/08/otis-spann-records-de.html" target="_blank">album</a> in 1960, and until his early death in 1970 released several more and performed with other bluesmen such as Howlin' Wolf, Buddy Guy, Peter Green, Eric Clapton, and more.</div><div></div><a name="more"></a><br><div>This album called 'Sweet Giant of the Blues' was recorded in 1969 on the Bluesway label produced by Bob Thiele. The album was released in 1970 months before his death. It has been re-released this year on the Ace label. </div><div><br></div><div>This album features a few genre cross-overs; other than being a strict Chicago blues, 12-bar shuffle romp (which I don't mind either way), has some Latin beats, funk soul, and R 'n B with a younger set of performers: Max Bennett on bass, Tom Scott on sax, Paul Humphrey on drums and Louie Shelton on guitar. Otis Spann's playing is spot on, however he doesn't take the solo spotlight on this album. He instead takes the important rhythmic role, leaving the gaps to be filled by the band. It's a fairly short album at 8 songs:  </div><div><br></div><div><span itemprop="name"></span></div><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td width="25"><div><span><b>1<p></p></b></span></div></td>  <td width="613"><div><span><b><span>Got My Mojo   Working</span><p></p></b></span></div></td> </tr><tr><td itemprop="byArtist" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/MusicGroup" width="25"><span itemprop="name"><span><b>  </b></span></span><br><div><span itemprop="name"><span><b>2<p></p></b></span></span></div><span itemprop="name"><span><b></b></span></span></td>  <td width="613"><div><span><b><span>Sellin' My   Thing</span><p></p></b></span></div></td> </tr><tr><td itemprop="byArtist" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/MusicGroup" width="25"><span itemprop="name"><span><b>  </b></span></span><br><div><span itemprop="name"><span><b>3<p></p></b></span></span></div><span itemprop="name"><span><b></b></span></span></td>  <td width="613"><div><span><b><span>Moon Blues</span><p></p></b></span></div></td> </tr><tr><td itemprop="byArtist" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/MusicGroup" width="25"><span itemprop="name"><span><b>  </b></span></span><br><div><span itemprop="name"><span><b>4<p></p></b></span></span></div><span itemprop="name"><span><b></b></span></span></td>  <td width="613"><div><span><b><span>I'm a Dues   Payin' Man</span><p></p></b></span></div></td> </tr><tr><td itemprop="byArtist" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/MusicGroup" width="25"><span itemprop="name"><span><b>  </b></span></span><br><div><span itemprop="name"><span><b>5<p></p></b></span></span></div><span itemprop="name"><span><b></b></span></span></td>  <td width="613"><div><span><b><span>I Wonder Why</span><p></p></b></span></div></td> </tr><tr><td itemprop="byArtist" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/MusicGroup" width="25"><span itemprop="name"><span><b>  </b></span></span><br><div><span itemprop="name"><span><b>6<p></p></b></span></span></div><span itemprop="name"><span><b></b></span></span></td>  <td width="613"><div><span><b><span>Bird in a Cage</span><p></p></b></span></div></td> </tr><tr><td itemprop="byArtist" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/MusicGroup" width="25"><span itemprop="name"><span><b>  </b></span></span><br><div><span itemprop="name"><span><b>7<p></p></b></span></span></div><span itemprop="name"><span><b></b></span></span></td>  <td width="613"><div><span><b><span>Hey Baby</span><p></p></b></span></div></td> </tr><tr><td itemprop="byArtist" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/MusicGroup" width="25"><span itemprop="name"><span><b>  </b></span></span><br><div><span itemprop="name"><span><b>8<p></p></b></span></span></div><span itemprop="name"><span><b></b></span></span></td>  <td width="613"><div><span><span><b>Make a Way</b></span></span><span><p></p></span></div></td> </tr></tbody></table><div><br></div><div>The album starts with a cover of Muddy Waters' 'I Got My Mojo Workin', that features sax playing by Tom Scott on the response during the chorus, unlike the original when the band sang back to Muddy. It's a pretty straightforward and cleanly played song. </div><div><br></div><div>'Sellin' My Thing' features a Latin sounding beat with distorted guitar playing; Otis's singing and piano is funky as heck. 'Moon Blues' is a minor blues, and sheds the sad soulful side of Otis. </div><div><br></div><div>'I'm a Dues Payin' Man' is a funk soul track, featuring heavy basslines and sax playing and is a pretty engaging track to hear at high volumes. 'I Wonder Why' is a straight-ahead Chicago style 12-bar blues. Nothing to surprising here beside the wah-guitar solo. </div><div><br></div><div>'Bird in a Cage' is a slow instrumental blues, and features a heavy fuzz guitar solo and an extended sax solo which is great for a midnight drink while reminiscing on old times. My standout track. </div><div><br></div><div>'Hey Baby' is another straight forward 12 bar blues, and the album closes with the gospel-like song 'Make a Way' where Otis sings: "I know my Jesus will make a way." It is by far the most soulful song on the whole album.</div><div><br></div><div>Overall it's a great album to have in a blues collection, as it's very reflective mellow album with a few upbeat tracks to change the pace. Perhaps not the best album Otis has made in his short career, but stands out to show his versatility as a musician. I always feel sad about losing him at an early age, especially when I heard Muddy Waters' talk about him so much after his death... he was devastated, and I somehow feel this loss once I hear him play.<br><br>Here's my standout track off the album, 'Bird in a Cage':<br><br><div><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="390" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/6KJ9lnU4k8o" width="540"></iframe></div></div><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/SpeakinTheBlues/~4/hTOebjRtjP4" height="1" width="1">";s:17:"post_image_height";i:1000;s:16:"post_image_width";i:1000;s:11:"post_visits";i:0;s:18:"post_twitterShares";i:4;s:19:"post_facebookShares";i:2;s:16:"post_totalShares";i:6;s:16:"post_socialScore";i:7;s:13:"post_virality";i:14;s:9:"blog_name";s:18:"Speakin' the Blues";s:16:"blog_description";s:31:"All Blues...

<p>People get high. They do it a lot and differently. Some use substance, some use music but most use both.<br>
or that, I’ve set up a list of 10 songs by 3 artists that will guide your psychedelic trip to dimensions you are yet to penetrate.</p>

<div></div>
<div>I hope you enjoy this list as much as I do. At some point, it starts playing in your head everytime you are deep in thought.</div>
<div></div>
<div>I also found that this list is beautifully fitting for more aggressive forms of meditation.</div>

Is it crippled or handicapped or what is that other word.. Challenged. Isn't that the word? Do you like that?"</i></span></div><div><br></div><div>Maybe they're just revving up for one heck of a mindblowing finale?</div><div><br></div><div><i>The Good Wife </i>has had such an incredible year, that I'm willing to let these past few hours slide. But let's hope they bring out the big guns next week because this is one season that deserves to go out with a bang!</div><div><br></div><div>I'm not exactly sure where Peter is heading as we approach the finale. I wasn't too pleased with the episode's final scene and the insinuation that he was about to indulge in his tempting intern. Hasn't the character demonstrated considerable growth over the past five seasons? Or do the writers insist on showing us that he'll never <b>really</b> change? Whatever he does, it's bound to cause some amusing drama, but hope it doesn't throw years of character work out the window. </div><div><br></div><div>I loved Eli going to Alicia and displaying genuine care over her relationship with Peter. These two have always had an unorthodox yet lovable bond, and it would be great if the show further explored their dynamic. Alan Cumming and Julianna Margulies possess that kind of easy chemistry that is far too rare and valuable. </div><div><br></div><div>I was certain Diane was being primed to leave Lockhart Gardner in favor of Alicia and Carey's firm, but it looks like she's going to stay and fight her way through David, Canning and the rest of the mutineers. Bringing Rayna Hecht to LG would have been an excellent move, but the writers obviously wanted to break Diane down even further. Thankfully, no one backs Christine Baranski into a corner. I feel a powerhouse performance coming.</div><div><br></div><div><span><b>Bits & Cases</b></span></div><div><br></div><div>- My favorite scene of the hour: Peter's reaction to the State's Attorney trying to blackmail him with pictures of Finn leaving Alicia's apartment. What does Peter do? He throws TWO drinks in the scumbag's face. Just epic. </div><div><br></div><div>- Finn's hair - weird. Or maybe it's normal now. </div><div><br></div><div>- Hilarious moment with Eli telling Lauren the intern to stay 50 feet away from Peter.</div><div><br></div><div>- Kalinda and Carey are sleeping together again. And the latter is dumb enough to still talk shop in front of her. Can we please pursue a fresher storyline here?</div><div><br></div><div>- Although the Paisley case-of-the-week was unmemorable, I enjoyed all the jury machinations. The highlight was the consequence of Alicia's "racist" interview as she mixed up the various black guys and got a glare full of daggers from one of the jury members. I believe this is the second time that Alicia has been called a racist recently. Are the writers trying to tell us something?</div><div><br></div><div><span><b>Good Lines</b></span></div><div><br></div><div>Eli: Okay if this were a normal conversation, I would now make fun of you for saying Lauren the intern is "people".</div><div><br></div><div>Eli: Is this about Will dying?</div><div>Alicia: This is about everything. I'm just tired. I'm just done. </div><div><br></div><div>Eli: Are you sleeping with Finn Polmar? </div><div>Alicia: Ask me another question.</div><div>Eli: I don't have any other.</div><div>Alicia: Then go to hell. </div><div><br></div><div><span><b>Conclusion</b></span></div><div>An amusing albeit forgettable penultimate hour from <i>The Good Wife. </i></div><div><span><b><br></b></span></div><div><span><b>Nad

Snow</b></span></span></div><div>And so it begins! The episode we have all been waiting for since the death of King Joffrey arrives. Because of all the pieces of the vast world of Westeros, the<i> Game of Thrones</i> writing team has been playing the (necessary) set-up game for the past three episodes. We had to put up with it for a while (secretly praying that the remaining episodes of the season were not all going to be set-up hours) and praise the Seven Gods, they were not. </div><div><br></div><div>The episode started out quite epically by introducing us to the world of Braavos and the Iron Bank, which is now a brand new player in the fight for the Iron Throne. This dialogue-heavy episode was written so beautifully and powerfully that every scene pushed the storyline further. From Braavos, we are whisked to Winterfell where Ramsay’s twisted nature comes full circle and we see an utterly broken Theon “Reek” Greyjoy.  Alfie Allen who plays Theon, is a breakout star for me in this episode. His acting was superb and captivating. Give this guy an Emmy nomination!</div><div><br></div><div>The scene with Daenerys, though normally I am a fan of any scene involving the wonderful Emily Clarke, was slightly off. It played out like the “this is what Danny is doing in the meantime” piece of the episode. </div><div><br></div><div>And then we enter King’s Landing where we remain for the second half of the episode and we bare witness to one of the best scenes in <i>Game of Thrones</i> history, in my opinion. The entire sequence of Tyrion’s “farce” trial (as Jaime Lannister calls it) had us all on the edge of our seats. Brilliantly directed, acted, edited and most of all written. The climactic sequence builds and then explodes with Tyrion going against all odds and defying the great Tywin Lannister. Peter Dinklage, I bow down to thee. His performance was breathtaking and gave me chills. He went from sarcasm, to disbelief, to utter heartbreak (does anyone else feel like they want to just strangle Shae???) then finally all out rage. The final shot of the episode with Tyrion half smiling was just epic. </div><div><br></div><div><span><b>Slices of Westeros</b></span></div><div><br></div><div>- Tyrion. ‘Nuf said!</div><div><br></div><div>- Jaime Lannister’s deal with Tywin. Jaime is truly a knight and an honorable man!</div><div><br></div><div>- Ramsay bathing Theon “Reek”…seriously Ramsay is creepy and has issues and I can’t wait until Theon kills him!</div><div><br></div><div>- Dragon barbecuing goats!</div><div><br></div><div><span><b>Kingly Exchanges</b></span></div><div><br></div><div>Lord Varys: (to Oberyn) When I see what desire does to people, what it’s done to this country, I am very glad to have no part in it. Besides, the absence of desire leaves one free to pursue other things.</div><div><br></div><div>Oberyn: (to Small Council) I have been to Essos and seen the Unsullied firsthand. They are very impressive on the battlefield. Less so in the bedroom.</div><div><br></div><div>Tyrion: (to Tywin) I will not give my life for Joffrey’s murder and I know I’ll get no justice here, so I will let the gods decide my fate. I demand a trial by combat.</div><div><br></div><div><span><b>Conclusion</b></span></div><div>This episode reminded me why I never doubt the <i>Game of Thrones</i> team and why I am certain they know what they are doing. It was filled with unforgettable moments and a cliffhanger that leaves you yelling and breathless.</div><div><br></div><div><span><b>A.

I love you.”</i></span></div><div><br></div><div><span><span><b>Review by Tagouga</b></span></span></div><div>After 10 seasons, Cristina Yang's journey on <i>Grey's Anatomy</i> has come to an end. This was the hour where we said our goodbyes to Cristina Yang and the extremely talented Sandra Oh. And for the first time on this show, we finally have a character leaving with a proper sendoff. Cristina's goodbyes were true to her character and it was a very emotional farewell. I cried when she said goodbye to Derek, I cried when she said goodbye to Bailey and Webber, I cried when she had that perfect unspoken moment with Owen, and yes I definitely cried (and smiled) when she danced it out with Meredith. Cristina's character is not the emotional type that is big on goodbyes so this was beautifully executed in my opinion. However I was a tad disappointed that she was not the sole focus of this hour. But since we had several episodes dedicated to her previously, it was acceptable. And at least she was not killed off in the explosion!</div><div><br></div><div>Speaking of that. Was it really necessary? I understand that this is a finale so something big MUST happen but the whole storyline felt forced and this did not feel like a <i>Grey</i>'s finale. (Again I am definitely thankful that no one died). Nevertheless, the events of the hour led to several developments: Catherine and April shared a nice moment, Leah is finally gone for good, and Callie and Arizona are having another baby after all, but this time via surrogate.</div><div><br></div><div>As for the cliffhanger for this season, this was unexpected but in a "made me roll my eyes" way: Another half-sister for Meredith who also happens to be Webber's daughter. Seriously? Seriously. And I know we should at least give her a chance but I already dislike the character. I am not the least bit intrigued by this new addition.  </div><div><br></div><div><span><b>Bits & Scalpels</b></span></div><div><br></div><div>- As expected, Shane asked Cristina to take him with her to Switzerland which she did. Goodbye Shane! </div><div><br></div><div>- I loved Cristina image collage at the beginning. The episode also closed on Cristina's name at the end.</div><div><br></div><div>- Webber is recommending Bailey to take Yang's place on the board which she actually left for Alex. Can't wait to see what happen when these two figure this out.</div><div><br></div><div>- Speaking of Alex, Cristina's acknowledgement of his surgical skills was her way of saying goodbye to him and it was remarkably nice when she asked Meredith to look after him. </div><div><br></div><div>- The envelope Cristina left for Alex had the nickname "Evil Spawn" on it. This brought a smile to my face.</div><div><br></div><div>- After her talk with Cristina, Meredith puts her foot down and rejects the idea of leaving everything behind and flying with Derek to DC. I am bit biased when it comes to McDreamy but I definitely understand where Meredith is coming from.</div><div><br></div><div>- The song “where does the good go” first heard on Season one was a very nice touch.</div><div><br></div><div><span><b>Grey Banter</b></span></div><div><br></div><div>Arizona: Are you looking to buy a road-penis?</div><div><br></div><div>Arizona: Are you gonna be Dr. Junior Butthole?</div><div><br></div><div>Homeland Security Guy: Ma'am, please!</div><div>Meredith: It's "doctor." You're the boss out there. I'm the boss in here. Get out of my way.</div><div><br></div><div>Cristina: How are you gonna cope with it?</div><div>Alex: With what?</div><div>Cristina: The boredom. Making buttholes will be your whole career. How will you not stick your head in the oven?</div><div>Alex: Screw you. I'll cry about it on my boat.</div><div><br></div><div>Cristina: You and I are not finished. George is dead, and Izzie is gone, and it is supposed to be you and me and Alex. And now nothing is finished. I am not finished.</div><div><br></div><div>Cristina: Take care of Alex. He needs to be mocked at least once a day, or he'll be insufferable.</div><div><br></div><div>Cristina: Don't let what he wants eclipse what you need. He's very dreamy. But he is not the sun.</div><div><br></div><div>Cristina: Don't get on any little, tiny planes that can crash or stick your hand in a body cavity that has a bomb in it. Or offer your life to a gunman!</div><div><br></div><div><span><b>Must-Download Tunes</b></span></div><div><br></div><div>Aqualung - Take On Me</div><div>Sleeping At Last - Ruby Blue</div><div>Tegan and Sara - Where Does the Good Go</div><div>Sleeping at Last - 99 Red Balloons</div><div><br></div><div><span><b>Conclusion</b></span></div><div>Cristina’s farewell was very well executed but the episode was undermined by subplots which won’t allow me to give this hour the rating I imagined I would be giving for a <i>Grey</i>’s finale.</div><div><br></div><div><span><b>Tagouga Rating</b></span></div><div><span><span><b>B</b></span></span></div></div>";s:17:"post_image_height";i:600;s:16:"post_image_width";i:1066;s:11:"post_visits";i:3;s:18:"post_twitterShares";i:0;s:19:"post_facebookShares";i:4;s:16:"post_totalShares";i:4;s:16:"post_socialScore";i:9;s:13:"post_virality";i:11;s:9:"blog_name";s:13:"Nad's Reviews";s:16:"blog_description";s:72:"Nad's Reviews specializes in TV reviews as well as films and restaurants";s:8:"blog_url";s:27:"http://www.nadsreviews.com/";s:11:"blog_author";s:3:"Nad";s:28:"blog_author_twitter_username";s:11:"NadsReviews";s:13:"blog_rss_feed";s:54:"http://www.nadsreviews.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss";s:9:"blog_tags";s:18:"tv, culture, media";s:2:"id";i:162;s:11:"blog_active";i:1;s:24:"blog_last_post_timestamp";i:1401652500;}i:34;O:8:"stdClass":26:{s:7:"post_id";i:29756;s:8:"post_url";s:78:"http://www.nadsreviews.com/2014/05/danas-review-vampire-diaries-5x22-home.html";s:10:"post_title";s:46:"Dana's Review: The Vampire Diaries 5x22 - Home";s:10:"post_image";s:156:"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-CuXjM1jwnuQ/U3hMg3t1x1I/AAAAAAAAKvM/RKbYC40AFn4/s1600/The-Vampire-Diaries-season-5-episode-22-season-finale-Home-Damon-feature.jpg";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:123:"Welcome to our newest guest-blogger, Dana.

Not just by anyone. By you, Elena Gilbert.”</i></span></div><div><br></div><div><span><span><b>Review by Dana</b></span></span></div><div>I think we can honestly say that <i>The Vampire Diaries</i> is officially back on track.</div><div><br></div><div>After a season weakened by vapid characters and insubstantial plot lines, <i>The Vampire Diaries</i>‘ writers were finally able to restore the former glory this show once possessed. I thought <i>The Vampire Diaries</i> had lost its spark, however I was proven wrong, when I found myself on the edge of my seat, overwhelmed with emotions wanting to know what happens next. I even realized that I was caring for characters I had lost interest in such as Jeremy, Stefan and Bonnie. However, the highlight of this episode was Damon and Elena. </div><div><br></div><div>Damon and Elena’s final scene was epic. All aspects of this scene were perfect; from the intense writing to the undeniable chemistry Ian Somerhalder and Nina Dobrev share. This scene toyed with my emotions in a way I never thought possible. Nina Dobrev’s performance was exceptional mirroring the frustration, angst, and devastation felt by viewers. This scene also portrayed the growth of Damon’s character; the Damon we see now is a far cry from the selfish, egocentric and homicidal character we met in season one.</div><div><br></div><div>I was glad to see that the Travelers were not a big part of this episode because Markos is honestly the most boring villain in this show’s history.  I am pleased to say that we are finally rid of them and their useless plotlines.  Seeing the rekindled friendships between Stefan and Lexi, as well as Damon and Alaric, reminded me of what initially attracted me to <i>The Vampire Diaries</i>; its emotional depth towards human friendships.  The final scene of this episode was probably the most heartwrenching. Although I don’t care about Bonnie and Jeremy’s relationship, I found myself tearing up as Jeremy ran to her begging her not to leave him.  However, Bonnie’s selflessness remains to be her most redeeming quality, for she willingly gives up her life to save her friends.

<p><span><strong>I try my best to eat healthy. Do I do it as often as I should? Not exactly, but considering how much junk food is readily available, I don’t always blame myself. When I do find that I’m having a hard time sticking to a healthier lifestyle, I do the one thing that has yet to fail me: I watch food documentaries. Whether it’s “Food Inc,” “Supersize Me,” “Food Fight” or “Fat, Sick, and Nearly Dead,” I find that scaring myself into changing my eating habits consistently works. “Fed Up,” which is produced and narrated by Katie Couric, is an extremely eye opening documentary that looks at the growing obesity problem in the United States, and the many causes behind it. As someone who has seen his fair share of food docs, I can confidently say this is a must-see.</strong></span></p>
<p><span>Sugar is the primary antagonist in “Fed Up.” While the film also throws jabs at processed and unnatural foods, its main goal is to change the misconception people have of fat, and to highlight how dangerously widespread sugar has become. Director Stephanie Soechtig does an wonderful job of differentiating fat from sugar, and why sugar is so much more harmful. Think you’re making a smart purchasing decision by buying low fat items? Think again. Low fat essentially means that the product has twice as much sugar as the regular version. Fat makes food taste good. Remove it from the equation, and you’re left with pretty bland tasting food. <em><strong>What food companies do is replace fat with sugar, which by the way is eight times more addictive than cocaine</strong></em>. Think about it for a second; we’re getting our kids hooked on a substance that’s more habit forming than a drug that can land you in jail. </span></p>
<p><a href="http://ageeksblogdotcom1.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/fed-up-sugar-cocaine-brain-scan-620.jpg"><img src="http://ageeksblogdotcom1.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/fed-up-sugar-cocaine-brain-scan-620.jpg?w=650" alt="fed-up-sugar-cocaine-brain-scan-620"></a></p>
<p><span>There are a lot of culprits when it comes to obesity in the United States; the food industry, the food lobby, marketing companies that target young children, government, and spineless elected officials. “Fed Up” makes sure to call everyone out, even people like Michelle Obama, who has made battling childhood obesity her primary focus as First Lady. There are some terrifying statistics about the kind of food kids in high school are fed on a daily basis, and that includes fast food like Papa John’s and McDonald’s. The salad dressing you buy at the grocery store has sugar in it. People think the answer is to eat less and exercise more, and while that’s true on some level, it most certainly is not a sufficient solution. </span></p>
<p><span>Any time steps are taken to make a difference in the kind of food that’s produced in the US, the food industry bands together and makes it virtually impossible for anyone to make any meaningful amendments. You want to know how ridiculously stupid things have gotten? In an attempt to defy an Obama administration proposal that aimed at making high school lunches healthier, Congress passed a spending bill that qualifies pizza as a vegetable because it contains a certain amount of tomato paste. Did you read that right? <strong>PIZZA IS NOW CONSIDERED A VEGETABLE BY THE US CONGRESS.</strong></span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://ageeksblogdotcom1.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/fedup-fact3.jpg"><img src="http://ageeksblogdotcom1.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/fedup-fact3.jpg?w=650&h=364" alt="FedUp-Fact3"></a></span></p>
<p><span><strong>The Verdict:</strong></span></p>
<p><span>Many people will likely assume that “Fed Up” is some kind of liberal propaganda telling you what and how to eat. That couldn’t be further from the truth. You’ll be shocked at how much sugar is found in everyday, non-dessert products, and by simply ignoring these facts, you become part of the problem. Don’t be stubborn; start learning about what you should be eating and how we can make a tangible difference. Watch “Fed Up,” and make sure your kids watch it too.</span></p>

Thank you."</span></i></div><div><br></div><div>Oh Nadim, learn to control your expectations.</div><div><br></div><div><i>Arrow</i>'s sophomore year has been a spectacular one. It took everything that the show did so well in its debut year, ironed out the kinks, and elevated every single aspect (storytelling, action, characters) to another level. Naturally, I had enormous expectations going into <b>Unthinkable</b>. Was I satisfied? You bet. Was this finale a masterpiece? Nope, but it came close.</div><div><br></div><div>Honestly, there's not much I <b>didn't </b>like about <b>Unthinkable</b>. It brought everything to a head in climactic fashion, and paid off almost every single subplot and character introduced throughout the year. Sadly, it was missing that special something; that one unforgettable emotionally-charged moment or scene - think back to <a href="http://www.nadsreviews.com/2014/04/arrow-2x20-seeing-red.html">Seeing Red;</a> a routine hour that was rendered remarkable thanks to Moira's stunning final sequence. That scene alone moved me like no other production on TV this year, and sadly, Unthinkable did not produce a moment that rivaled that gem.  </div><div><br></div><div>Maybe it's the fact that we didn't get any huge deaths? Shockingly, both Sara and Slade survived. The former is now brilliantly imprisoned in an A.R.G.U.S. hatch deep below the island's surface, while the latter is back with Nyssa and the League. Both of these characters' fates subverted my expectations, and I guess it's an intelligent move because it means we'll undoubtedly be seeing more of them in the future. And something tells me Slade will end up being the show's ultimate big bad whenever <i>Arrow</i> eventually comes to an end. </div><div><br></div><div>One genuinely surprising thing the writers did manage to pull off in the finale was the Felicity twist. I honestly totally bought Ollie professing his love to her in the manor (and claiming that Laurel wasn't the one he loved). So imagine my surprise when the twist was revealed (with fantastic use of Slade's hidden cameras) and Felicity marvelously took out the cure and injected it into Slade. The payoff with Ollie and Felicity on the island at the end was a poignant moment for the duo, and I'm sure it broke a zillion Olicity hearts across the globe. However, I'm totally fine with this development, and I found it quite satisfying and unorthodox. Plus, as I've made clear before, I do want Laurel and Ollie to be the show's endgame couple (as unpopular an opinion as that might sound). </div><div><br></div><div>I'm not sure if Detective Lance is dead, but it's just the kind of loss needed to drive Laurel to really take up the Black Canary mantle. I loved her goodbye with Sara, who unofficially passed the baton over to her (with that sexy-as-hell leather jacket). Good things are coming for Laurel. I can feel it. </div><div><br></div><div>I must say, I'm enormously intrigued by Thea's journey next year. Now that she has nothing left to lose and she's lost faith in everyone around her, I think she's going to have a fascinating road into hopefully supervillain territory. And hey, more Malcolm is always a great thing. </div><div><br></div><div>Special mention must be given to Ollie's speech outside Slade's cell. It was tremendously resonant on a thematic level, as Ollie finally acknowledged the hero's he'd become, particularly after successfully immobilizing Slade without the use of fatal force.  </div><div><br></div><div>Finally, <b>Unthinkable</b> did a great job of bringing the show's two-season narrative to a satisfying conclusion, while opening up a whole new phase in the show's journey. The final flashback further punctuated this evolution with Ollie waking up in Hong Kong at the hands of Amanda Waller. It's not exactly a bombshell ending, but it will hopefully nudge the show into a new and exciting direction.</div><div><br></div><div><b><span>Heroic Bits</span></b></div><div><br></div><div>- I must point out that the finale's Previously On segment was beautifully constructed, beginning with Ollie and Slade's first encounter. It added a real sense of weight to the proceedings. </div><div><br></div><div>- Although I was never Layla's biggest fan, she had a kickass moment with the rocket launcher as she saved Team Arrow in their thrilling escape from the clock-tower.</div><div><br></div><div>- Although I think Colton Haynes still has ways to go as an actor, I was glad to see Roy finally get his sidekick mask. However, I was shocked to see him lose the Mirakuru powers. I guess he's going to need some good ol' fashioned training to reach his true potential. </div><div><br></div><div>- How anticlimactic was Isabel's death? I think this aspect disappointed me most. The character was built up over the course of the season, particularly with her Ravager transformation, only to fizzle out in the end. I so wish the Nyssa-Canary-Ravager fight lasted longer than two seconds. On the bright side, Ollie, Canary and the League taking control of Queen Consolidated was a great moment, and Nyssa got to snap Isabel's neck like the badass that she is. </div><div><br></div><div>- Awesome shot of Arrow and the League as they head to battle. Again, I wish the actual fight was longer. </div><div><br></div><div>- Total hero moment: Lance saving Nyssa. </div><div><br></div><div>- The CGI with the Amazo getting torpedoes surprisingly wasn't that bad.</div><div><br></div><div>- Loved the visual callback to the pilot with Sara getting away. </div><div><br></div><div>- Even the Suicide Squad was paid off in the finale with Diggle and Layla infiltrating A.R.G.U.S. and letting the team go before cornering Amanda. Not bad at all. </div><div><br></div><div>- How fantastic was the editing between Ollie and Slade's fights in the present and the past? I was astounded. And the culmination with Ollie stabbing Slade in the eye with an arrow while tying him up in the present was incredible. </div><div><br></div><div><span><b>Super Liners</b></span></div><div><br></div><div>Felicity: Geez Sara, you could have called before you invited 3, 4, 5... 7 assassins into our headquarters.</div><div><br></div><div>Nyssa: I am Nyssa, daughter of Ra's Al Ghul. Heir to the Demon.</div><div>Felicity: Felicity Smoak, MIT class of '09.</div><div><br></div><div>Malcolm: Thea it's dangerous out there.</div><div>Thea: Better than here with my psycho-villain dad who's happy I tried to kill him. </div><div><br></div><div>Lance: You've killed before. Tonight, I suggest you get back in the habit.</div><div><br></div><div>Nyssa: I would die before I let anything happen to your daughter.</div><div>Lance: Here's hoping.</div><div><br></div><div>Slade: That's your problem kid; you don't have the guts to kill me.</div><div>Oliver: No I have the strength to let you live. </div><div><br></div><div>Oliver: We need to get my family's company back.</div><div>Felicity: That's not gonna be easy since you're poor now. You're gonna have to get a job. If Slade doesn't scare you, that's gotta to. </div><div>Oliver: Do you know anyone hiring ex-billionaires with superior archery skills. </div><div><br></div><div><span><b>Conclusion</b></span></div><div>A very solid and satisfying bookend to an outstandingly consistent sophomore season. However, <b>Unthinkable</b> needed a stronger dose of emotion to really cement itself as a masterpiece. </div><div><br></div><div><span><b>Nad Rating</b></span></div><div><span><span><b>A</b></span></span></div></div>";s:17:"post_image_height";i:638;s:16:"post_image_width";i:960;s:11:"post_visits";i:3;s:18:"post_twitterShares";i:1;s:19:"post_facebookShares";i:3;s:16:"post_totalShares";i:4;s:16:"post_socialScore";i:9;s:13:"post_virality";i:11;s:9:"blog_name";s:13:"Nad's Reviews";s:16:"blog_description";s:72:"Nad's Reviews specializes in TV reviews as well as films and restaurants";s:8:"blog_url";s:27:"http://www.nadsreviews.com/";s:11:"blog_author";s:3:"Nad";s:28:"blog_author_twitter_username";s:11:"NadsReviews";s:13:"blog_rss_feed";s:54:"http://www.nadsreviews.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss";s:9:"blog_tags";s:18:"tv, culture, media";s:2:"id";i:162;s:11:"blog_active";i:1;s:24:"blog_last_post_timestamp";i:1401652500;}i:37;O:8:"stdClass":26:{s:7:"post_id";i:29642;s:8:"post_url";s:117:"http://lgghanem.com/comic/arrow-salmon-ladder/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=arrow-salmon-ladder";s:10:"post_title";s:20:"Arrow: Salmon Ladder";s:10:"post_image";s:0:"";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:123:"Let the DC films take note, because Arrow is showing them how it’s done.

</p><div>Let the DC films take note, because <em>Arrow</em> is showing them how it’s done. It’s unabashedly and quite successfully adapting all sorts of characters, without worrying about gritty realism, or underestimating the audience. Its world is barely 2 years old and it’s already populated with the likes of Green Arrow, Black Canary, Arsenal, Deathstroke, Huntress, Deadshot, Brother Blood, Solomon Grundy, and the Flash, who’s already spun off into his own promising show. In that regard, this one TV show got much closer to rivaling the Marvel Cinematic Universe in terms of world-building than <em>Man of Steel</em> and the other DC films even hoped for, and it did it much faster.</div>
<div>If <em>Arrow</em> and <em>The Flash</em> continue to live up to and even exceed expectations, this is the live-action DC Universe I’m investing in.</div>
<div>P.S. A pun in the title <em>and</em> in the comic. I sure have outdone myself!

Do you hear that? That’s Grace Kelly turning in her grave. Kelly, a former actress turned Princess, is one of the most iconic women of the 20th Century, if not the greatest. But telling her story is no easy achievement. Enter French director Olivier Dahan, who brought visionary zest to Edith Piaf in 2007′s “La Vie En Rose” starring Oscar winner Marion Cotillard. So why not cast Nicole Kidman this time around as Grace Kelly? Add to that the underrated Tim Roth as Kelly’s husband, Prince Rainier, and the great Frank Langella as Father Francis Tucker and Kelly’s dear friend and what do you get? A disaster. Shush. Can you hear that? That’s blind ambition being gutted by terrible execution. Aside from the staggering beauty of Gigi Lepage’s costumes and Eric Gautier’s cinematography, nothing works. The actors are buried in the art direction, along with feeling. The film feels dull and lifeless. Dahan and his writer Arash Amel take risks by conceiving Kelly as an unhappy wife and princess. That made me crazy. But not as much as hearing Kidman’s cheesy speech about “love” and “fairy tales”. There may be worse movies this summer than “Grace Of Monaco” (bring it on, “Transformers”), but there won’t be a more crushing disappointment.</p>

<p><strong><span>“</span><span><a href="http://ageeksblog.com/2014/04/29/movie-review-the-amazing-spider-man-2-2014/">The Amazing Spider-Man 2</a></span><span>” remained on top of the Lebanese box office for the second straight weekend in a row, dropping by a reasonable 52% to 13,677 admissions for an impressive total of 42,672 in just two weeks. It will most certainly experience a much steeper drop next weekend with the arrival of “<a href="http://ageeksblog.com/2014/05/13/movie-review-godzilla-2014/">Godzilla.</a>“</span></strong></p>
<p><span>The new Seth Rogen/Zack Efron comedy “</span><a href="http://ageeksblog.com/2014/04/17/movie-review-neighbors-2014/">Neighbors</a><span>” (or “Bad Neighbors” in select territories) has been tearing up the North American box office, although it surely won’t do that same kind of business in Lebanon. The film opened behind the latest Spidey flick in the number two spot with 9,177 admissions; a pretty solid figure for an R-rated comedy. Positive word-of-mouth should help make this a popular choice for audiences in the weeks to come.</span></p>
<p><span>“</span><a href="http://ageeksblog.com/The%20Other%20Woman">The Other Woman</a><span>” has been holding steady in the top three, and dropped by a meager 42% to 5,904 admissions for a very impressive total of 29,772 admissions after three weeks in theaters. “<a href="http://tlkabtmovies.com/2014/05/07/walk-of-shame-2014/">Walk of Shame</a>” tumbled by 50% to 3,002 admissions for the week, raising its total to a so-so 9,001.</span></p>
<p><span>Fifth place went to Wes Anderson’s</span> “<a href="http://ageeksblog.com/The%20Grand%20Budapest%20Hotel">The Grand Budapest Hotel</a><span>,” which added 2,472 admissions (a 46% drop) for a cume of 7,074 admissions to date. New release “<a href="http://tlkabtmovies.com/2014/05/10/in-the-blood-2014/">In the Blood</a>” tanked with an opening of 2,192 admissions over four days, good enough for sixth place. Expect the film to disappear from theaters quite soon.</span></p>
<p><span>After five weeks in theaters, Haifa Wehbe’s “Halawet Rooh” kept going strong, adding 1,976 admissions for a great sum of 45,113 admissions. The film experienced a mild 48% week-over-week drop. Eighth place went to Darren Aronofski’s bible epic, “</span><a href="http://ageeksblog.com/Noah">Noah</a>,<span>” which has been a mainstay at the Lebanese box office since its release five weeks ago. Russell Crowe’s latest dropped by 60% to 1,482 admissions for an incredible total of 57,330 tickets sold to date.</span></p>
<p><span>“The House of Magic” has been hanging in the top ten by a thread, and dropped to ninth place with 1,266 admissions. It dropped by 45%, and has only sold 7,938 tickets in three weeks. Paul Walker’s “</span><a href="http://ageeksblog.com/Brick%20Mansions">Brick Mansions</a><span>” has been performing marginally better, and rounded out the top ten with 1,135 admissions for a disappointing total of 8,532 after three weeks.  I wouldn’t be too upset with these results, though, since millions of fans will surely by lining up to catch Walker in what will officially be his final film, “Fast and Furious 7.”</span></p>

It’s that time again people! This is the third installment of the <em>Tony Rocks!</em> series of posts, wherein I showcase some awesome tunes right out of the soundtracks of a game from the <em>Tony Hawk’s</em> series. Today, we’ve reached one of the best yet: <em>Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3</em>. Now things were getting really tight. You had rock, punk, hip hop, electronic-fusion-rock, and all kinds of crazy stuff, including tracks from some pretty big names like the Red Hot Chili Peppers, The Ramones and even Motörhead!</p>

<p>I actually had trouble keeping them under 10 this time! Like I said, this is when things were getting really good in the audio-department. Now, do a manual, kickflip that son of a bitch and grind a rail all the way down through these wicked tracks…</p>

All that matters is winning."</i></span></div><div><br></div><div>Good, but still not great.</div><div><br></div><div>I know that an epic, exhilirating hour of <i>24</i> is coming, but the show's iconic return hasn't blown my mind quite just yet. It's a pity really because I thought this season's 12-episode format would mean we'd jump straight into the action, but things aren't exactly thrilling yet. </div><div><br></div><div>I applaud the writers for affording the season's Big Bad so much attention. Michelle Fairley's turn as widow terrorist Margot Al Harazi is suitably creepy. In addition, it comes complete with a drone-relate trauma that fuels her present-day vendetta, and an unsettling desire to pimp her daughter out by any means necessary. Less successful is the attention afforded to the relationship between her daughter Simone and her husband Navid. Do we really need such soap opera theatrics distracting us from the main plot? The whole point of a 12-hour season is so we can sidestep such superfluous subplots. I guess some things never change.  </div><div><br></div><div>Thankfully, Bauer and Chloe's dynamic is still a joy to watch, and now there's an added layer to the proceedings with the heartbreaking reveal of Chloe's husband and son dying thanks to her extracurricular activities with Jack in the past. I've always loved these two, and the writers continue to display subtle finesse where this bond is concerned. More please.  </div><div><br></div><div>The ending of this hour was also excellent with Jack purposely (and shockingly) shooting several innocent bystanders in the legs. His act causes just enough panic and chaos to gain him entry into the embassy with Morgan hot on his trail.

<p><strong><span>Okay, so it’s</span> <a href="http://www.blogtalkradio.com/ageeksblog/2013/08/25/ben-affleck-as-batman-a-geeks-reaction">no secret<span> </span></a><span>I’m not that big on the idea of Ben Affleck playing the role of Batman/Bruce Wayne. I think the actor is just too damn recognizable, which could end up being highly distracting since all I’ll be seeing is Ben Affleck in a Halloween costume. But man, what a costume it is!</span></strong></p>
<p><span>THIS is the Batman fans have been wanting to see on the big screen for years, and he looks badass. The new suit seems mostly inspired by Frank Miller’s seminal “The Dark Knight Returns,” as well as more recent incarnations like the Arkham games. I’m loving the bat on his chest and everything about the cowl. This could very well be the best looking Batman to ever appear on the big screen. Affleck looks huge too, which is also a lot more consistent with what fans expect from the character.</span></p>
<p><span>As much </span><a href="http://ageeksblog.com/2014/05/04/part-of-me-wants-the-justice-league-movie-to-fail-part-ii-the-zack-snyder-dilemma/">as I love to riff </a><span>on DC’s cinematic universe, I’m very comfortable in admitting that Snyder has done a terrific job with the suit, but I never expected any less. Does this picture actually do anything to alleviate my concerns regarding Ben Affleck? Not really; I still think he was a poor choice, but if we’re strictly talking about looks, then yeah, he most certainly looks the part.</span></p>

It felt like it could have so easily wrapped up the entire series, save a few plot details here and there. I was originally going to review these episodes separately, but they formed such a singular story in the end so I changed my mind.</div><div><br></div><div>It’s odd that it was so disconnected from the Wicked heavy arc that drove the last nine episodes. Though with Zelena’s death in <b>Kansas</b> it was pretty much a given that the finale would explore less Oz related material. It’s a decision that gave us more time to focus on the characters; not just Snow and Charming, but Emma and Hook as well.</div><div><br></div><div>They had so many great moments together and making them the centre of both parts of the finale gave it energy and injected fun and excitement into what could have been a half assed clip show.</div><div><br></div><div>We already know all about how Snow and Charming met and fell in love, but Emma seeing it firsthand, and thinking she lost them again, helped her get over silly desire to run back to New York, despite all the people she has in Storybrooke. I know we’ve seen her embrace her part in the family, then disconnect from them...and then rejoin them all over again, but something about her turn here felt more solid.</div><div><br></div><div>She also fell right into life in the Enchanted Forest. We’ve seen her in that world before, but not in the same way she was here, playing princess and interacting with her parents in their pre-gag-inducing-lovey-doveyness stage.</div><div><br></div><div>Of course, it wasn’t just about Snow and Charming. Emma and Hook were just as important to this two-parter as the former two were. I loved all their scenes together, especially Emma seducing past Hook to get him away from his ship, and I even more so Hook telling Emma he sold his ship to bring her back home.</div><div><br></div><div>Her decision to stick by her family puts her directly in Regina’s line of fire. I really, really hope that we don’t see Regina fall apart and go back to her old ways to get back at Emma for taking Robin from her. Her blaming Emma and Snows’ mistakes on lack of foresight was silly (Emma didn’t bring Robin’s dead wife back on purpose, and Snow didn’t kill Daniel), and I can only hope that with everyone now on her side, Regina can see sense this time around...Please let her see sense...</div><div><br></div><div><b>There’s No Place Like Home</b> gave the show a clean break from this past season. I’m glad to be rid of anything Neverland related, and though I enjoyed Zelena infinitely more than I did Pan, I’m happy that the series is going to try something new again. I just hope that it’s a direction that is necessary.</div><div><br></div><div>The Disney stamp has never been more obvious than it was in those final few seconds, and I’ve read countless of outcries from fans about Elsa’s arrival, with most shouting “cash grab!” or worse. I’m not sure what to feel about it yet. I think everyone should reserve judgment for fall time when we see what the creators will actually do with her. Horowitz and Kitsis have been very outspoken about why they chose to bring her onboard, and the exploration of a wrongly accused villain does fit right in alongside a lot of the character arcs going on right now.</div><div><br></div><div><span><b>Plus</b></span></div><div><br></div><div>“Prince Charles” and “Princess Leia”. That was a highlight of the finale, for sure.</div><div><br></div><div>I also really got a kick out of all the familiar faces popping up. I assume now that Intelligence is dunzo that Meaghan Ory can come back again?</div><div><br></div><div>I loved how simple and sweet Rumple and Belle’s wedding was. I hope that what Rumple did doesn’t rip them apart again. It so will, though.</div><div><br></div><div>It was nice to see Neal again. I like that Emma’s idea of home comes from him.</div><div><br></div><div>The time traveling was a hoot here, but I don’t want to see it revisited, at least not for a while. It can get stale and tedious, not to mention confusing.</div><div><br></div><div>Emma has her powers back! I’d like to see her get more creative with them next season.</div><div><br></div><div><span><b>He Said, She Said</b></span></div><div><br></div><div>Emma: “[Neal] died to save all of us. Don’t let that be in vain.”</div><div>This scene between Emma and Rumple was actually incredible, even though it blew up out of nowhere.</div><div><br></div><div>Hook: “Let’s just say we bury the hatchet.”</div><div>Rumple: “Yes, but why not in your skull.”</div><div><br></div><div><span><b>Conclusion</b></span></div><div>The direction that season four will actually take is anyone’s guess. We could see old habits re-surface (Regina going after Emma, Rumple being sneaky) or we could see these characters doing something new and more interesting. For the sake of the show I really hope it’s the latter, because it served them so well these past few weeks. A trip down memory lane was all well and good here, but a more permanent one wouldn’t go over well. I have faith in this show now, though, in way that I didn’t this time last year, so I’m hopeful that we’ll be pleasantly surprised come September.</div><div><br></div><div><span><b>Panda Rating</b></span></div><div><span><span><b>A-</b></span></span></div><div><br></div><div><div><span><span><span><span>Previously posted at </span></span><b><span><b><span><a href="http://panda-tv.blogspot.com/">PandaTV</a>.</span>  </b></span></b></span></span></div></div><div><br></div></div>";s:17:"post_image_height";i:666;s:16:"post_image_width";i:1000;s:11:"post_visits";i:1;s:18:"post_twitterShares";i:0;s:19:"post_facebookShares";i:0;s:16:"post_totalShares";i:0;s:16:"post_socialScore";i:2;s:13:"post_virality";i:2;s:9:"blog_name";s:13:"Nad's Reviews";s:16:"blog_description";s:72:"Nad's Reviews specializes in TV reviews as well as films and restaurants";s:8:"blog_url";s:27:"http://www.nadsreviews.com/";s:11:"blog_author";s:3:"Nad";s:28:"blog_author_twitter_username";s:11:"NadsReviews";s:13:"blog_rss_feed";s:54:"http://www.nadsreviews.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss";s:9:"blog_tags";s:18:"tv, culture, media";s:2:"id";i:162;s:11:"blog_active";i:1;s:24:"blog_last_post_timestamp";i:1401652500;}i:46;O:8:"stdClass":26:{s:7:"post_id";i:29521;s:8:"post_url";s:75:"http://www.nadsreviews.com/2014/05/tagougas-review-greys-anatomy-10x23.html";s:10:"post_title";s:96:"Tagouga's Review: Grey's Anatomy 10x23 - Everything I Try to Do, Nothing Seems to Turn Out Right";s:10:"post_image";s:99:"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-IW4zwmU4lks/U3NIP7Q0R-I/AAAAAAAAKuE/-1Pke0U52Rc/s1600/135525_8991_pre.jpg";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:123:"Don't forget to follow Nad's Reviews on Facebook and Twitter for the latest updates. “Don't leave me until you're leav...";s:7:"blog_id";s:11:"nadsreviews";s:14:"post_timestamp";i:1400064300;s:12:"post_content";s:3567:"<div dir="ltr" trbidi="on"><div><span><span><b><span><b><span><b><span>Don't forget to follow<span> Nad's Reviews </span>on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/NadsReviews">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/NadsReviews">Twitter</a> for the latest updates.</span></b></span></b></span></b></span></span> </div><div><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-IW4zwmU4lks/U3NIP7Q0R-I/AAAAAAAAKuE/-1Pke0U52Rc/s1600/135525_8991_pre.jpg" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-IW4zwmU4lks/U3NIP7Q0R-I/AAAAAAAAKuE/-1Pke0U52Rc/s1600/135525_8991_pre.jpg" height="267" width="400"></a></div><div><span><i>“Don't leave me until you're leaving me.”</i></span></div><div><br></div><div><span><span><b>Review by Tagouga</b></span></span><br>We are getting closer and closer to saying goodbye to Cristina Yang, one of my personal favorite characters on <i>Grey's Anatomy</i>. In order to find a new head of cardio, Hunt asked Cristina to carry out candidate interviews herself. Mer pointed out that this was an attempt by Owen to show Cristina that none of the applicants (which he screened earlier) were a better fit for this job than Cristina. Although this actually was the case, Owen soon realized that it was the right step for Cristina to leave the hospital and pursue her dream. His asking her to stay until she actually had to leave was utterly heartbreaking. I am <b>so</b> not ready to say farewell to this character, and the way that she handled those job applicants was hysterical!</div><div><br></div><div>Elsewhere, Bubble Boy was finally ready to go home. However, once his parents found out the real reason behind his quick recovery, they decided to press charges against Bailey! Unwilling to stand by and watch, Stephanie made a bold move and decided to take the blame so Bailey could continue with her procedure and other patients could benefit from the treatment. Is it me or does it seem like Bailey has been getting a lot of negative storylines lately? I really miss the Nazi!  </div><div><br></div><div><span><b>Bits & Scalpels</b></span></div><div><br></div><div>- Amelia decided to stay in Seattle. Given how Meredith and Amelia are on good terms now and how she is about to break up with her boyfriend, it seems we will in fact be seeing more of her next season.</div><div><br></div><div>- Derek is planning a move to D.C. after meeting the president himself. This might actually happen. After all, they had Cristina move across the country for almost half a season!</div><div><br></div><div>- It turned out that Leah was in fact the one who got fired. Thank god for that!</div><div><br></div><div>- With Callie unable to carry another baby and Arizona initially not wanting to get pregnant, the pair will not be having their second baby. I am glad Callie did not push Arizona to carry the baby; that wouldn't have ended well.</div><div><br></div><div><b><span>Grey Banter</span></b></div><div><br></div><div>- Callie: Check yourself before you wreck yourself.</div><div><br></div><div><span><b>Must-Download Tunes</b></span></div><div><br></div><div>Claire Guerreso - Tainted Love</div><div>Imperial Mammoth - Dance Hall Days</div><div>Brock Tyler - Jump (For My Love)</div><div><br></div><div><span><b>Conclusion</b></span></div><div>This episode was a bit weak in my opinion and felt only like a preparation for Cristina's farewell.

Honestly I was tremendously taken aback by how this development came about. I'd been anticipating the Brit's death for a while now, but I never imagined we would see Victoria <i>physically suffocate him</i> with a pillow. This brutal act certainly erased any ambiguity Victoria had left (much like Conrad's vicious murder of Pascal a few weeks back), and it unequivocally positions her as the show's full-on Big Bad. Sadly, this move also renders Victoria pretty unlikeable (part of me always maintained somewhat of an affinity for the evil Queen). But now? She's just despicable, which made the episode's final sequence all the more satisfying.<br><br>Yes, I am of course referring to Emily hatching yet another one of her brilliant plots - this time institutionalizing Victoria in the very same asylym that traumatized our heroine as a child. Watching Victoria howl the words <b>"She's Amanda Clarke" </b>endlessly was a haunting sight, punctuated by Emily's badass final strut (ushering in a new era for the show). Simply put, <i>Revenge</i> managed to flip its entire status quo on its head. This had been my dream for quite a long time, and the show will undoubtedly come back as a completely different beast in season four now that the Grayson saga has been completely exposed (and David's name has been cleared). Which leads us to....<br><br>David Clarke is <b>A-L-I-V-E. </b>This is certainly a jump-the-shark- moment, and I honestly feel like it should have been avoided. Doesn't this twist completely undermine Emily's agenda and the entire show along with it? I know that's what the writers were going for, but I don't exactly seeing it working because it feels like we were invested for nothing. Nevertheless, I will reserve judgement regarding this bombshell until the show's return next year. On the bright side, the move was well executed with David Clarke revealing himself on the highway and fatally stabbing Conrad. Herny Czerny you will be missed, although I think we had enough of you. Plus, you got a great swan song by buying your way out of prison decked out in Priest-garb. Hilarious.<br><br>Sadly, <b>Execution</b> wasn't perfect. It's unfortunate really, but the writers evidently still have <u>no</u> idea how to handle Charlotte. Wouldn't the character and the show improve tremendously if Charlotte finally discovered Emily's identity? Having her cause trouble on the periphery is extremely frustrating. Instead of feeling riveted by her ratting out Jack to the authorities, I was pretty much rolling my eyes the whole way through. Oh Declan, why didn't you take your irritating girlfriend with you? <br><br>Although they didn't get too much screentime, I also hated Daniel and Margaux's subplot as they dealt with the arrival of her brother Gideon. I must sound like such a broken record, but <i>Revenge</i> does <b>NOT</b> need so many new characters popping in and out. It pains me that the writers are oblivious to this incessantly recurring misstep. Am I supposed to be intrigued by Gideon and Nolan setting up Daniel as a prostitute-killer? It just feels like a distraction from the main plot. Again, it would do the show a hell of a lot of good to kill off Daniel and Charlotte (and this week was the perfect opportunity). <br><br>Finally, let's take a moment and reflect on Emily VanCamp's downright phenomenal performances the past two weeks. I completely bought Emily's proclaiming that she was finally "ready to love" although it was sadly far too late. The sequence in which she stumbled onto Aiden's body was just remarkably powerful. Aiden's open jaw, his terrified look, Emily's screams - it was all stunningly realized, and VanCamp's work was masterful. Give this girl some awards. <br><br><span><b>Vengeful Bits</b></span><br><br>- Emily's fight with Vicky's David Clarke stalker might be the single most impressive fight scene the show's ever done. Kudos.<br><br>- The manner in which Victoria murdered Aiden was admittedly brilliant. She has Dr. Michelle poison him (leading to his paralysis), before choking him to death. One fascinating moment in between: Aiden lunging at Victoria and her retaliating with a desperate plea (Do it!). I guess Vicky has a death wish after all. <br><br>- Terribly sad touch with the tear streaming down Aiden's lifeless body. <br><br>- Haunting moment with Victoria hearing Emily's screams from Grayson Manor.<br><br>- Heartbreaking scene: a lifeless Emily draped on her bed and telling  Nolan that she never really loved anybody besides Aiden. Did anyone else  kind of want the IT whiz to give her a hug? Would have been perfect.  <br><br>- Fascinating touch with Emily letting the authorities believe Aiden's death was a suicide so she could handle the matter herself. <br><br>- Series highlight: Emily slamming Victoria across the face with a shovel. Seriously, that moment was three seasons in the making and it was freakin' <b>glorious</b>. <br><br>- So Charlotte figured Jack was the "kidnapper" after he touched her? Good lord. <br><br>- Loved Emily threatening Dr. Banks and ensuring her help in the episode's final scene as they both turned the tables on Victoria. <br><br><span><b>Devious Delights</b></span><br><br>Conrad: Bless you, my son. The riches of heaven surely await you... in your checking account.<br><br>Emily: I love him. And I never loved anybody. <br><br><span><b>Conclusion</b></span><br>I <u>so</u> want to give <b>Execution</b> an <span><b>A+</b></span>, but Charlotte and Daniel's storylines prove that this finale fell short of perfection. Nevertheless, this was a sensational and intensely riveting hour. And for the second week in a row, it's one of <i>Revenge</i>'s finest episodes <b>ever</b>.
