But unfortunately, far too many apartments and even so-called villas of our day and age fit the caveman ticket at least in their exteriors. Cities today, just like the past 100 years have the flair of stacked caves that are crowded into buildings are deficient of character. They are structures built from primitive design or shortsighted greed, or both. Consequently, millions of buildings in thousands of cities are only theoretically conducive of social life and economic activity, lacking structural character that would support their owners and tenants in improving their lives.</p>
<p>Beirut also is stacked with buildings that create feelings ranging from distance to disgust, whether as fancy but wholly unimaginative towers or as barely functional boxes used for commerce, housing, leisure or education. But that is not the whole truth. There is not only a small and dwindling portfolio of heritage buildings that help the city to breathe civilization, there is also a small but growing stock of new buildings that represent ingenuity and some that even make us think — and perhaps help us think more constructively.</p>
<p>When Executive last month surveyed one such building, the new home of the Issam Fares Institute think tank on the grounds of the American University of Beirut, IFI director Rami Khouri said that the new building had immediately boosted his team’s ability “to do better work.” Part of this was due to the structure’s information and communications technology features and the high visibility that the building provided. But another part of the productivity gains derives from the building’s design and the conducive environment that it generates, Khouri said, inspiring staffers to conduct their “core activities with much greater enthusiasm.”</p>
<p>With a tip of the hat to the project owners, architects and developers that have invested themselves in unconventional projects, Executive has put together a selection of recently completed buildings that impress us as concepts, and which give us something to think about. Some may even be seen as entrenched, positive elements of the city’s fabric in 100 years time.</p>

The clamoring being heard from opportunists on all sides gives us reason to believe that madness inhabits the minds of many rulers and politicians who are trying to exploit the blood of Gaza’s heroes. This is the first time that concern is justified in this matter, because the issue here is not just about the calculation of Resistance fighters on the battlefield, but also about the calculation of those who can influence them, and those who are trying to hijack their achievements to use them as bargaining chips.</p><p>Because the issues are rather clear and unambiguous, it is necessary to abandon the preliminaries and deal with the major points:</p><p>- Concerning the Resistance forces, we have to acknowledge, with admiration, pride, reassurance, and hope, that what the Resistance fighters are doing in Gaza today is a qualitative leap in the performance of the Palestinian Resistance. Their conduct on the battlefield as well as on the political level portends good things of the kind we saw in Lebanon before.  </p><p>Concerning the Resistance forces, we have to acknowledge, with admiration, pride, reassurance, and hope, that what the Resistance fighters are doing in Gaza today is a qualitative leap in the performance of the Palestinian Resistance. Regardless of the nature of the decision to kidnap the three settlers in the West Bank, subsequent events indicate that the Resistance understood well the nature of the enemy and its measures.  The Resistance was quick to take precautionary measures and others to increase its readiness, thwarting the enemy’s traditional plans in hitting the Resistance cadres and assets. </p><p>While there are some among us who like to visit the past to warn, emphasize lessons, or attempt to get credit even if after the fact, the reality is that there are in Gaza Resistance heroes leading the most difficult battle with a most difficult and brutal enemy. These heroes have excelled not only at bringing in as many weapons and equipment as possible, but also at finding ways to develop their own weapons to haunt the enemy. While Hezbollah may have rockets that can destroy entire buildings at any location in historic Palestine, the Resistance fighters in Palestine can now force the residents of these buildings to evacuate, which is a psychological victory no less important than physical destruction. </p><p>Furthermore, the performance of the Resistance in the past few days underscores why it needs all the support it can get. Those who believe in the importance of shoring up the abilities of the Resistance must seek ways to support it with funds, equipment, and additional skills. The Resistance does not lack personnel, nor bright and innovative minds, and it does not need advice or lessons. It needs the wherewithal to manufacture weapons that can deter the enemy.</p><p>In addition, the measures of the Resistance in Gaza, and the measures by the Resistance cadres who captured the settlers, reflect high awareness, something that has led the enemy to a total intelligence failure. To this moment, the enemy does not know the answer to questions like: How do we deter the Resistance again? </p><p>- With regards to the Palestinian Authority and other factions in Palestine, the ongoing confrontations have shown that it does not make sense anymore to take part in any negotiations with the enemy. Estrangement with the enemy cannot harm the Palestinians anymore. Participation in negotiations no longer serves the advocates of a peaceful settlement. If the leadership of President Mahmoud Abbas still rejects armed resistance, this is certainly not the case for the popular base of the Fatah movement and other factions of the PLO. Unless these forces grow the teeth they need, through the forces of resistance, the enemy will not respond even to a phone call. </p><p>- Concerning the forces of the resistance axis, there have been some despicable attitudes voiced by some of their supporters, whether those who only see in Palestine and among residents of Gaza, people who differ with them in Syria or elsewhere, or those who link the future of the Resistance to what the axis alone decides. </p><p>There are worrying signs that have emerged in more than one place as well. We do not need to talk about Iraqi isolationism that refuses to pay attention to the Palestinian cause. There is no need to talk about the narrative of justification espoused by part of the supporters of the Syrian regime to say that the war on terror is the main issue. What Syrian President Bashar al-Assad said in his speech on Wednesday is relevant, as he reaffirmed the link between his and Hezbollah’s actions in Syria and the aggression on Gaza. </p><p>Even on the Hezbollah side, the performance of its direct media institutions – let alone those it is indirectly affiliated to – is incomprehensible vis-à-vis the events in Gaza. There is nothing to justify the subpar coverage of Gaza by a channel like Al-Manar, be it Ramadan and its programming, or other events in the world. </p><p>Today, we must restore not only the perception of Palestine as a central cause, but also the practice that reflects this conviction.- Regarding the Muslim Brotherhood camp, any attempt to exploit the victories of the Resistance to further its agenda in any other country will not work. The blood of the Resistance fighters cannot be used by those who have the closest relations with the enemy and the United States, and who are allies with colonialist Europe. </p><p>Those Muslim Brotherhood figures, including Hamas leaders, who try to claim that what is happening in Gaza is part of the Muslim Brotherhood’s pushback against their opponents in Egypt, Syria, the Gulf, the Arab Maghreb, and Yemen are deluded and foolish. Those who try to use what is happening in Gaza to blackmail the countries of the resistance axis, especially Iran, are delusional. Indeed, the relationship between this axis and the Resistance in Palestine no longer requires permission from anyone. Therefore, the Muslim Brotherhood camp must find other tricks to make its comeback. As for the countries that sponsor them like Turkey and Qatar, let them wash their dirt with something other than the blood of Gazans. Pompous and loud rhetoric is useless and worthless.  </p><p>- As for Egypt, especially under Sisi, the attempt to link its position on the aggression against Gaza to the implications of defeating the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt is politically shortsighted, if not foolish. Gaza will always remain part of Egypt’s strategically vital sphere of influence. </p><p>While the fools in the Gulf may be expected to think about taking over Egypt’s role in Gaza, it would be madness personified if anyone in Egypt comes to believe that Gaza is now part of the Arabian Peninsula. The political, security, diplomatic, and even humanitarian conduct of the Sisi administration reflects shortsightedness regarding Egypt’s role above all. This issue has to do with Egypt’s lost role. If Sisi and his team believe that “self-dissociation” on Gaza, or sitting idly by the bloodletting there, can help the cause of stability in Egypt or bring in more aid, then they would be returning to the three decades under the previous regime, which was allowed, in return for its inaction, to repress and rob its people, but nothing more.</p><p>Today, we must restore not only the perception of Palestine as a central cause, but also the practice that reflects this conviction. In Lebanon, the least we can do in this regard is release Sheikh Hussein Atwi and honor him, instead of dealing with him as a criminal who wanted to put Lebanon in a bad position! </p><p>Ibrahim al-Amin is the Editor-in-Chief of Al-Akhbar.</p><p>This article is an edited translation from the Arabic Edition.</p>";s:17:"post_image_height";i:495;s:16:"post_image_width";i:780;s:11:"post_visits";i:8;s:18:"post_twitterShares";i:0;s:19:"post_facebookShares";i:6;s:16:"post_totalShares";i:6;s:16:"post_socialScore";i:15;s:13:"post_virality";i:14;s:9:"blog_name";N;s:16:"blog_description";N;s:8:"blog_url";N;s:11:"blog_author";N;s:28:"blog_author_twitter_username";N;s:13:"blog_rss_feed";N;s:9:"blog_tags";N;s:2:"id";N;s:11:"blog_active";N;s:24:"blog_last_post_timestamp";N;s:6:"col_id";i:5;s:8:"col_name";s:36:"Ibrahim al-Amin at Al-Akhbar English";s:16:"col_media_source";s:17:"Al-Akhbar English";s:13:"col_home_page";s:37:"http://english.al-akhbar.com/node/125";s:13:"col_shorthand";s:8:"iaminakh";s:26:"col_media_source_shorthand";s:9:"al_akhbar";s:27:"col_author_twitter_username";N;s:8:"col_tags";s:20:"columnists, politics";s:15:"col_description";s:51:"Ibrahim al-Amin is the Editor in Chief of Al-Akhbar";s:23:"col_last_post_timestamp";i:1405602652;}}
