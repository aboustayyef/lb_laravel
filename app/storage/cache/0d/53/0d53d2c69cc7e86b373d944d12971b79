<p dir="LTR">I strongly disagree after two weeks of interviews here in Beirut with a wide range of officials from all sides including hizbullah. Indeed, why should the party by “disappointed?”</p>
<p dir="LTR">Hamas is trying to do the impossible by fighting on essentially a small beach of territory some few kilometers wide, with ZERO depth, with rockets that <strong>pale</strong> in comparison to both the AMOUNT and TYPE that hizbullah possesses (the swarm effect and the better tech is what Hizbullah is likely banking on for the next conflict , even if davids sling is introduced).</p>
<p dir="LTR">Bottom line: Hamas’s fight now is NOT being viewed as anything close to a test run of the next Hizbullah-Israel war.</p>
<p dir="LTR">One useful thing this analyst says however: he acknowledges something which is largely NEVER reported on but which is crucial to analysing the balance of power in the region. Hamas is mimicking Hizbullah’s approach to target MILITARY installations as a key aspect of their campaign. From al-monitor:</p>
<p dir="LTR">****************</p>
<p dir="LTR">At the outset of the conflict, Hamas attempted a “shock and awe campaign,” including tunnel-borne kidnapping raids under the Israeli border, navel commando incursions and drone attacks meant to degrade Israeli morale. According to experts who spoke to Al-Monitor, this is the same strategy that Hezbollah would likely employ in the first days of a future conflict with Israel. Israel thwarted all of Hamas’ surprises, including the <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/7/14/5897665/israel-shoots-down-hamas-drone" target="_blank">armed drone</a> incursion.</p>
<p dir="LTR">Hamas’ rocket infrastructure, meanwhile, is now nearly identical to that of Hezbollah’s in Lebanon, apart from the smaller numbers and sophistication of projectiles. Unlike past conflicts, most of Hamas’ rocket launchers are concealed under the sands of Gaza or in sensitive civilian areas, with local cells using motorcycles to dart between firing positions. One can imagine that Hezbollah is watching how a frustrated Hamas repeatedly fails in its attempts to confuse and overwhelm Israel’s air-defense Iron Dome system with coordinated rocket barrages over large areas at a time. <strong>While the media is restricted from reporting such attacks, it has been widely claimed by Hamas that many of their rockets have been fired toward the vicinity of key air force bases of Tel Nof, Hatzor, Hatzerim and Nevatim in an attempt to hit runways and stifle Israeli air force bombing. During the 2006 conflict, Hezbollah focused much of its fire on hitting the Ramat David air base in northern Israel’s Jezreel Valley, hitting the runway in at least one instance.</strong></p>

The pi&egrave;ce de r&eacute;sistance was without doubt a vigorous, almost rock-like &ldquo;Jawaz al-Safar&rdquo; (&ldquo;Passport&rdquo;), featuring a standing, show-stealing piano solo from Marcel&rsquo;s son, Rami, that had a woman of no fewer than 70 years dancing like a teenager up and down one of the aisles.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A couple of veteran Marcel fans felt there were one or two more guest solo singers than was perhaps necessary (I counted four).

Of course this doesn’t reflect dominant public opinion in the West that still is apologetic of Israel’s actions. Not one official state declaration has condemned the Israeli attacks. If anything, the few who bothered to issue a statement reiterated Israel’s right to defend itself as it was perceived to live under a constant threat of rocket shower. <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2014/07/world-reacts-conflict-gaza-201471073217736666.html" target="_blank">Check here</a> if you want to have goose bumps.</p>
<p>But there is one place where no demonstrations are in sight: the Arab world. Also, not one condemnation was issued by any Arab government, not one declaration. It is taken for granted that no Western government has condoned Israeli attacks either. But how can we explain this apathy sweeping the Arab region? Surely, they have their own problems all linked to one or other form of occupation. But this conflict used to be called the Israeli-Arab conflict for crying out loud!</p>
<p>A couple of centuries ago, the situation in the region looked very similar: the crusaders were well entrenched on the coast of the “fertile crescent”, and the rest of the Muslim world was completely paralyzed, accepting, if not complicit, in the status quo of occupation until Nur ad-din and his successor Saladin challenged the paradigm. This is at least what the history books say. Some of this dominant cultural apathy or nonchalance, the surrender and normalization, must have existed so that these two individuals and the movements they represented have gone down in the books as changing the face of history.</p>
<p>Modern Arabs have not used their historical consciousness as an agent of ideological change or political action. The basic nationalistic experiments that were fashioned by colonial encounters left Arabs struggling over questions of terminology and then categorizing history in one way or another. Devising points of reference and of origin. The crusades episode was barely glossed over (until now the only book that presents an interesting take on that episode is Amin Maalouf’s. That tells you about the state of the literature).</p>
<p>On one hand, Arab leftist movements were too busy looking towards a brighter socially more “evolved” future and being ashamed of their Islamic heritage, helplessly wanting to teach social and political “progress” of the West. On the other hand, nationalist movements were quarreling amongst each other finding all kinds of identitarian anchors to justify their causes (the Omayyad period was a favorite as it looked the most “secular”, but also anything pre-Islamic).</p>
<p>No one thought of approaching history as giving lessons for political practice. More recently but still a couple of centuries ago, the “Renaissance” Italian writer Machiavelli looked at the history of the Roman Empire in this particular vein as he hoped to provide advice to unite the various Princedoms feuding over Italy. Interestingly, Machiavelli was categorized as ushering a new era of thinking politics outside the scope of religion, a state that had lasted since the advent of Catholic Christianity in Europe.</p>
<p>In modern times, we have fallen in to the trap of categorizing Machiavelli a secular thinker as opposed to one that was just opposed to dominant categories of analysis that happened to be held at the time by the Catholic Church with its particular understanding of history. The point of thinkers such as Machiavelli was to say that the Catholic Church could not provide the needed leverage to create political unity. Ideologically speaking, there was a need to produce new categories of thinking. Machiavelli called for a new political science, one that does away with traditional categories of analysis, not because they were bad or “backward”, but because the institutions backing them did not have anymore the means to create new political realities.</p>
<p>All this is to say that Arabs have been obsessed with categorizing things as either secular or religious as intellectuals of all creeds desperately clung on to the categories of colonial heritage. How could they have done otherwise? The colonizer had also captured their texts and by this token had controlled the creation of knowledge emanating from these writings! The primary victim of this reversed Orientalism espoused by Arabs was historical consciousness. The past became a cumbersome process that was only used to create identities, differences and reactionary discourse and not be a repository for good action.</p>
<p>The rise of Political Islam was a direct reaction to this awkward and clumsy attitude towards history. Suddenly the past was all important. But what kind of past? For example, during the Lebanese “civil war”, the crusader episode was visited in history by various Muslim groups but only to identify them to the contemporary Lebanese Christians who they were fighting between 1975 and 1990. Even though one could retrieve lessons in political practice from these uses of the past they were also creating group differentiation (here Christian VS Muslims).</p>
<p>And every time history was revised it was to create identitarian differences. Such as fomenting trouble between Sunni and Shia denominated groups. Books and articles, talk-shows and documentaries, all proliferate on relentless questions and searches of authenticity, developing either an alleged Sunni or Shia take on the Islamic tradition. No wonder we’ve been busied away from other conflicts.</p>
<p>As I looked for what was written on Nur ad-din, most of what I found was how much he was a great Sunni leader who opposed Shia Fatimid Egypt of the time. In effect, this is not incorrect. But that’s not what the prevailing historians of the time want us to remember, at least in the aftermath of the defeat against the crusaders. The point here is not that the “right” conflict is looking for the right identity to conflict with. The point is to look at the location of forms of occupation, oppression, unjust violence, etc. and understand how to remedy that through the legacy of others who did before us. How can one create the necessary form of consciousness through learning from the past in order to produce community change?</p>
<p>With technological revolutions and every single group or individual having a media channel of his own this ideological rallying is an immense challenge. It is ironic that Arabs are said to be closer to democracy or accountability given that they don’t even pressure their government to do something about Palestine. Is this a sign of apathy, a change of heart, or just a failure to understand and return the debt to the past?</p><br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/remarkz.wordpress.com/4826/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/remarkz.wordpress.com/4826/"></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=remarkz.wordpress.com&blog=3584669&post=4826&subd=remarkz&ref=&feed=1" width="1" height="1">";s:17:"post_image_height";i:0;s:16:"post_image_width";i:0;s:11:"post_visits";i:1;s:18:"post_twitterShares";i:3;s:19:"post_facebookShares";i:0;s:16:"post_totalShares";i:3;s:16:"post_socialScore";i:6;s:13:"post_virality";i:9;s:9:"blog_name";s:7:"Remarkz";s:16:"blog_description";s:62:"Footnotes on what came to be called the Middle East and beyond";s:8:"blog_url";s:28:"http://remarkz.wordpress.com";s:11:"blog_author";s:7:"Remarkz";s:28:"blog_author_twitter_username";N;s:13:"blog_rss_feed";s:34:"http://remarkz.wordpress.com/feed/";s:9:"blog_tags";s:8:"politics";s:2:"id";i:119;s:11:"blog_active";i:1;s:24:"blog_last_post_timestamp";i:1405677120;s:6:"col_id";N;s:8:"col_name";N;s:16:"col_media_source";N;s:13:"col_home_page";N;s:13:"col_shorthand";N;s:26:"col_media_source_shorthand";N;s:27:"col_author_twitter_username";N;s:8:"col_tags";N;s:15:"col_description";N;s:23:"col_last_post_timestamp";N;}i:5;O:8:"stdClass":36:{s:7:"post_id";i:32886;s:8:"post_url";s:65:"http://blogoftheboss.com/cnn-team-threatened-by-israely-citizens/";s:10:"post_title";s:39:"CNN team threatened by Israeli citizens";s:10:"post_image";s:84:"http://blogoftheboss.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/wpid-2014-07-18-01.07.05.png.png";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:123:"Diana Magnay, international correspondent for CNN just reported,  through her personal twitter account, being threatene...";s:7:"blog_id";s:13:"blogoftheboss";s:14:"post_timestamp";i:1405635480;s:12:"post_content";s:1150:"<p>Diana Magnay, <strong>international correspondent for CNN</strong> just reported,  through her personal twitter account, being threatened by Israelis while covering the Gaza invasion.</p>

The clamoring being heard from opportunists on all sides gives us reason to believe that madness inhabits the minds of many rulers and politicians who are trying to exploit the blood of Gaza’s heroes. This is the first time that concern is justified in this matter, because the issue here is not just about the calculation of Resistance fighters on the battlefield, but also about the calculation of those who can influence them, and those who are trying to hijack their achievements to use them as bargaining chips.</p><p>Because the issues are rather clear and unambiguous, it is necessary to abandon the preliminaries and deal with the major points:</p><p>- Concerning the Resistance forces, we have to acknowledge, with admiration, pride, reassurance, and hope, that what the Resistance fighters are doing in Gaza today is a qualitative leap in the performance of the Palestinian Resistance. Their conduct on the battlefield as well as on the political level portends good things of the kind we saw in Lebanon before.  </p><p>Concerning the Resistance forces, we have to acknowledge, with admiration, pride, reassurance, and hope, that what the Resistance fighters are doing in Gaza today is a qualitative leap in the performance of the Palestinian Resistance. Regardless of the nature of the decision to kidnap the three settlers in the West Bank, subsequent events indicate that the Resistance understood well the nature of the enemy and its measures.  The Resistance was quick to take precautionary measures and others to increase its readiness, thwarting the enemy’s traditional plans in hitting the Resistance cadres and assets. </p><p>While there are some among us who like to visit the past to warn, emphasize lessons, or attempt to get credit even if after the fact, the reality is that there are in Gaza Resistance heroes leading the most difficult battle with a most difficult and brutal enemy. These heroes have excelled not only at bringing in as many weapons and equipment as possible, but also at finding ways to develop their own weapons to haunt the enemy. While Hezbollah may have rockets that can destroy entire buildings at any location in historic Palestine, the Resistance fighters in Palestine can now force the residents of these buildings to evacuate, which is a psychological victory no less important than physical destruction. </p><p>Furthermore, the performance of the Resistance in the past few days underscores why it needs all the support it can get. Those who believe in the importance of shoring up the abilities of the Resistance must seek ways to support it with funds, equipment, and additional skills. The Resistance does not lack personnel, nor bright and innovative minds, and it does not need advice or lessons. It needs the wherewithal to manufacture weapons that can deter the enemy.</p><p>In addition, the measures of the Resistance in Gaza, and the measures by the Resistance cadres who captured the settlers, reflect high awareness, something that has led the enemy to a total intelligence failure. To this moment, the enemy does not know the answer to questions like: How do we deter the Resistance again? </p><p>- With regards to the Palestinian Authority and other factions in Palestine, the ongoing confrontations have shown that it does not make sense anymore to take part in any negotiations with the enemy. Estrangement with the enemy cannot harm the Palestinians anymore. Participation in negotiations no longer serves the advocates of a peaceful settlement. If the leadership of President Mahmoud Abbas still rejects armed resistance, this is certainly not the case for the popular base of the Fatah movement and other factions of the PLO. Unless these forces grow the teeth they need, through the forces of resistance, the enemy will not respond even to a phone call. </p><p>- Concerning the forces of the resistance axis, there have been some despicable attitudes voiced by some of their supporters, whether those who only see in Palestine and among residents of Gaza, people who differ with them in Syria or elsewhere, or those who link the future of the Resistance to what the axis alone decides. </p><p>There are worrying signs that have emerged in more than one place as well. We do not need to talk about Iraqi isolationism that refuses to pay attention to the Palestinian cause. There is no need to talk about the narrative of justification espoused by part of the supporters of the Syrian regime to say that the war on terror is the main issue. What Syrian President Bashar al-Assad said in his speech on Wednesday is relevant, as he reaffirmed the link between his and Hezbollah’s actions in Syria and the aggression on Gaza. </p><p>Even on the Hezbollah side, the performance of its direct media institutions – let alone those it is indirectly affiliated to – is incomprehensible vis-à-vis the events in Gaza. There is nothing to justify the subpar coverage of Gaza by a channel like Al-Manar, be it Ramadan and its programming, or other events in the world. </p><p>Today, we must restore not only the perception of Palestine as a central cause, but also the practice that reflects this conviction.- Regarding the Muslim Brotherhood camp, any attempt to exploit the victories of the Resistance to further its agenda in any other country will not work. The blood of the Resistance fighters cannot be used by those who have the closest relations with the enemy and the United States, and who are allies with colonialist Europe. </p><p>Those Muslim Brotherhood figures, including Hamas leaders, who try to claim that what is happening in Gaza is part of the Muslim Brotherhood’s pushback against their opponents in Egypt, Syria, the Gulf, the Arab Maghreb, and Yemen are deluded and foolish. Those who try to use what is happening in Gaza to blackmail the countries of the resistance axis, especially Iran, are delusional. Indeed, the relationship between this axis and the Resistance in Palestine no longer requires permission from anyone. Therefore, the Muslim Brotherhood camp must find other tricks to make its comeback. As for the countries that sponsor them like Turkey and Qatar, let them wash their dirt with something other than the blood of Gazans. Pompous and loud rhetoric is useless and worthless.  </p><p>- As for Egypt, especially under Sisi, the attempt to link its position on the aggression against Gaza to the implications of defeating the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt is politically shortsighted, if not foolish. Gaza will always remain part of Egypt’s strategically vital sphere of influence. </p><p>While the fools in the Gulf may be expected to think about taking over Egypt’s role in Gaza, it would be madness personified if anyone in Egypt comes to believe that Gaza is now part of the Arabian Peninsula. The political, security, diplomatic, and even humanitarian conduct of the Sisi administration reflects shortsightedness regarding Egypt’s role above all. This issue has to do with Egypt’s lost role. If Sisi and his team believe that “self-dissociation” on Gaza, or sitting idly by the bloodletting there, can help the cause of stability in Egypt or bring in more aid, then they would be returning to the three decades under the previous regime, which was allowed, in return for its inaction, to repress and rob its people, but nothing more.</p><p>Today, we must restore not only the perception of Palestine as a central cause, but also the practice that reflects this conviction. In Lebanon, the least we can do in this regard is release Sheikh Hussein Atwi and honor him, instead of dealing with him as a criminal who wanted to put Lebanon in a bad position! </p><p>Ibrahim al-Amin is the Editor-in-Chief of Al-Akhbar.</p><p>This article is an edited translation from the Arabic Edition.</p>";s:17:"post_image_height";i:495;s:16:"post_image_width";i:780;s:11:"post_visits";i:8;s:18:"post_twitterShares";i:0;s:19:"post_facebookShares";i:6;s:16:"post_totalShares";i:6;s:16:"post_socialScore";i:15;s:13:"post_virality";i:14;s:9:"blog_name";N;s:16:"blog_description";N;s:8:"blog_url";N;s:11:"blog_author";N;s:28:"blog_author_twitter_username";N;s:13:"blog_rss_feed";N;s:9:"blog_tags";N;s:2:"id";N;s:11:"blog_active";N;s:24:"blog_last_post_timestamp";N;s:6:"col_id";i:5;s:8:"col_name";s:36:"Ibrahim al-Amin at Al-Akhbar English";s:16:"col_media_source";s:17:"Al-Akhbar English";s:13:"col_home_page";s:37:"http://english.al-akhbar.com/node/125";s:13:"col_shorthand";s:8:"iaminakh";s:26:"col_media_source_shorthand";s:9:"al_akhbar";s:27:"col_author_twitter_username";N;s:8:"col_tags";s:20:"columnists, politics";s:15:"col_description";s:51:"Ibrahim al-Amin is the Editor in Chief of Al-Akhbar";s:23:"col_last_post_timestamp";i:1405602652;}i:8;O:8:"stdClass":36:{s:7:"post_id";i:32858;s:8:"post_url";s:121:"http://ritachemaly.wordpress.com/2014/07/17/job-vacancy-field-officers-for-the-women-economic-empowerment-programme-weep/";s:10:"post_title";s:80:"job vacancy:  Field Officers for the Women Economic Empowerment Programme (WEEP)";s:10:"post_image";s:0:"";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:123:"   CRTD.A Post Vacancy   2 Field Officers (In Beqaa and South Lebanon)   Duration of the post: 1 year Immediate Recr...";s:7:"blog_id";s:11:"ritachemaly";s:14:"post_timestamp";i:1405582140;s:12:"post_content";s:513:"   CRTD.A Post Vacancy   2 Field Officers (In Beqaa and South Lebanon)   Duration of the post: 1 year Immediate Recruitment   As part of its Women Economic Empowerment Programme and RUWOMED project, CRTD.A is recruiting two Project Field Officers to support the implementation of the project.   The Women Economic Empowerment Programme (WEEP) […]<img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=ritachemaly.wordpress.com&blog=7747045&post=5220&subd=ritachemaly&ref=&feed=1" width="1" height="1">";s:17:"post_image_height";i:0;s:16:"post_image_width";i:0;s:11:"post_visits";i:2;s:18:"post_twitterShares";i:5;s:19:"post_facebookShares";i:2;s:16:"post_totalShares";i:7;s:16:"post_socialScore";i:10;s:13:"post_virality";i:16;s:9:"blog_name";s:19:"Rita Chemaly's Blog";s:16:"blog_description";s:51:"Political and Social activism in Lebanon and Abroad";s:8:"blog_url";s:32:"http://ritachemaly.wordpress.com";s:11:"blog_author";s:12:"Rita Chemaly";s:28:"blog_author_twitter_username";s:11:"Ritachemaly";s:13:"blog_rss_feed";s:38:"http://ritachemaly.wordpress.com/feed/";s:9:"blog_tags";s:19:"activism , politics";s:2:"id";i:120;s:11:"blog_active";i:1;s:24:"blog_last_post_timestamp";i:1405582140;s:6:"col_id";N;s:8:"col_name";N;s:16:"col_media_source";N;s:13:"col_home_page";N;s:13:"col_shorthand";N;s:26:"col_media_source_shorthand";N;s:27:"col_author_twitter_username";N;s:8:"col_tags";N;s:15:"col_description";N;s:23:"col_last_post_timestamp";N;}i:9;O:8:"stdClass":36:{s:7:"post_id";i:32859;s:8:"post_url";s:91:"http://ritachemaly.wordpress.com/2014/07/17/femmes-en-politique-au-liban-une-honte-en-2014/";s:10:"post_title";s:46:"Femmes en Politique au Liban une honte en 2014";s:10:"post_image";s:0:"";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:123:"Le nombre de Femmes en Politique au Liban est a mon avis honteux.

<p>Today, “there are unsold apartments,” says Massaad Fares, CEO of Prime Consult. Getting more personal, Fares says that “slightly more than half” of his company’s mixed-use Sama Beirut is sold. The tower near Sodeco Square is the city’s tallest building and is set to be delivered in 2015.<span> </span></p>
<p><span>There are indications the real estate market may be picking back up. Cement deliveries in the first four months of 2014, according to the most recent data, are up 9 percent compared to the same period in 2013. Both the number of real estate transactions and the value of said transactions are also up, but Jihad Ibrahim, general manager of Jamil Ibrahim Establishment, tells Executive that these last two figures can be misleading.</span></p>
<p><b>Slow years for development companies</b></p>
<p>The number and value of transactions are recorded at the General Directorate for Real Estate Affairs when apartments are handed over, not when contracts are signed (i.e., when sales happen), Ibrahim says. He notes that many developers focus heavily on off-plan sales, so many contracts are signed years before they are registered.</p>
<p><span>Therefore, increases in the number and value of transactions are not reliable indicators of new sales activity, he argues. </span></p>
<p>In the nation’s capital, “the only oxygen in the market is in the low-income segment,” says Ibrahim, whose family owned development company builds multimillion dollar flats for the top 1 percent of buyers.</p>
<p>Ibrahim’s firm has been particularly hard hit by the slow years. He says 40 percent of his stock is unsold and he’s sitting on parcels of land that should be holes in the ground by now.</p>
<p>“We’re finishing the projects we have on hand, and there are three or four big projects, and we stopped everything else,” he says. “We have seven projects with their permits ready that were supposed to be phased in … What we did was completely stop to see what we’ll do with the stock we have on hand.”</p>
<p>While 2014 may reverse the trend, real estate transactions reported to the country’s official registry had been shrinking in number since 2011, after nearly a decade of growth. Prices, however, have not followed transactions south given the particularities of Lebanon’s real estate market — its size is small, developers are not heavily leveraged, domestic demand is steady and expatriates are hungry for a slice of their homeland, even if that appetite can be suppressed by political and security instability.</p>
<p>While new projects (both big and small) are still being announced, Premiere Properties’ CEO Antoine Habr says developers are taking their time before launching new ventures.</p>
<p>“Business doesn’t stop, it just slows down,” he says. “I would say, instead of jumping immediately to the next idea or the next opportunity, people would [want to] take more time to analyze the market, study, recruit the right people to give them the right feedback and information, and [do] more pre-work preparation before jumping to the next opportunity like everyone used to do.”</p>
<p>With an eye on better times, Prime Consult’s Fares says many developers are buying up space for future use.</p>
<p>“They are all now buying land,” he says. “Developers, instead of developing, are buying the land, preparing the plans and taking their time in preparation.”</p>
<p>Habr argues it’s a buyer’s market all round.</p>
<p>“This is the right time to buy. This is the right time to invest,” he says. “There’s more room for negotiation on all levels. Definitely you can have good opportunities out there. There are no panic sales or anything, it’s just that when you sit with somebody, you’ll be able to negotiate better and get more of what you want, more than [you could] before.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, for Ibrahim, land is an extra revenue stream in times he says are so tough that the company is laying off employees “for the first time in our history.”</p>
<p>He says the company has purchased large tracts of land in the Bekaa and the South, which is partially being developed into low-cost housing by subcontractors and partially sold at a profit.</p>
<p><b>Buying land in the meantime</b></p>
<p>“We’re not interested in the return on the construction, it is so insignificant for us,” says Ibrahim. “What’s significant is when you take a big lot, divvy it up and then sell it; there, the internal rate of return is much, much higher. When construction stops, we go into related businesses, which is land appropriation. We can afford to do that, keep ourselves busy, but it’s definitely not the answer.”</p>
<p>While groundbreakings may be fewer and farther between, there are new projects in the pipeline. Sayfco Holding announced late last year that it would be taking a 50,000-square-meter bite into the Mediterranean to build a new, $1 billion resort in Zouk, just north of Beirut. The company says it has a permit to reclaim land from the sea for the project that will sprawl over 100,000 square meters and become the country’s largest resort.</p>
<p>Fares says Prime Consult recently bought some 100,000 square meters of land on the Metn highway and is in negotiations to buy land in Jounieh — he refuses to reveal where — also for a resort.</p>
<p><span>Habr also teases details of a “well studied,” soon-to-be announced, two-tower gated community in the Mar Rukouz area of the eastern suburbs of Beirut. Like Premiere Properties’ other projects, the new one will utilize a dedicated, audited account with a major local bank for any money made off of pre-</span>sales.</p>
<p>“We guarantee in this way that the funds of this project are dedicated to the construction of the project and not for speculation toward other investments, whether it be in real estate or for personal use,” Habr says.</p>
<p>“This is an initiative from the private sector whereby a few private developers are implementing this business model. But it’s not a [law]. That’s the problem. Like in Dubai or London or anywhere in Europe … it’s imposed by the legislation. In Lebanon it’s not.”</p>
<p>Of the new development’s location, Habr says the area is attractive because of its proximity to Beirut.</p>
<p>Fares calls the eastern suburbs “the future.” “The land in Beirut has become so expensive, it has become prohibitive to buy an apartment in Beirut,” he says.</p>
<p>An interesting question moving forward is what the future will hold for both the eastern suburbs and the rest of the country. To date, there has been no <span>real long-term urban planning for the country’s development, and legislation has consistently become more friendly to developer’s wants (see “<a href="http://www.executive-magazine.com/business-finance/real-estate/higher-regulation" target="_blank">Higher Regulation</a>“). A common theme that emerged from the interviews for this report is that developers will continue to buy up large parcels of land for self-sustained — often gated — communities. </span></p>
<p><span>What is unclear is whether or not the public sector — be it on the national level or in municipal offices — is thinking of how to oversee such future developments or how feasible it will be to tame the sprawling regulatory framework currently in place.</span></p>

<p>Fellow blogger <a href="http://twitter.com/ghazayel">Mahmoud Ghazayel</a>‘s post about this mistake on Air Arabia’s wall garnered some funny comments from people who wondered whether this was the Lebanese Pre-Independence map or maybe the Post-Da3esh one! Others asked whether the agency finally did what the Lebanese Government failed to do for years, redrawing our borders with Syria!</p>
<p>While we are sure this is an innocent design mistake or lack of attention to details, it is not forgivable when it comes from a big agency specialized in travel and expected to be trustworthy especially when it comes to geography!</p>
<p>We do give <a href="http://facebook.com/airarabiagroup">Air Arabia</a> credit points for promoting Lebanon as a hub for its low fare flights, benefiting both tourism and business in the country. We do ask them however, to make this correction swiftly, keeping Beirut on the map…the right map!</p>

Sources suggest that current IS members have old ties to militant group Fatah al-Islam, which clashed with the Lebanese Army in Nahr al-Bared camp back in 2007. Back then, the group&rsquo;s leader was accused of being a Syrian operative engaged in destabilizing Lebanon&rsquo;s government. Today, circumstantial evidence also raises the possibility of the IS having been infiltrated by Syrian intelligence so as to gear the group&rsquo;s activities towards the regime&rsquo;s interests.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The formal declaration of an Islamic state by insurgents in Syria and Iraq reverberated immediately in Lebanon. Soon thereafter, the IS assigned a man identified as Abdel Salam al-Ordoni as the organization's emir, or leader, in Lebanon.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Days before this, security forces had intercepted jihadist cells at the Napoleon and Duroy Hotels in Beirut, which, according to reports, had been dispatched by ISIS to carry out suicide attacks against Hezbollah strongholds. The Islamic State claimed responsibility and has since been issuing threats to both Hezbollah and the Lebanese government.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In one of its statements, the IS dedicated a song to Islamist inmates at Roumieh prison calling for their release, and set the holy month of Ramadan as a deadline past which it would use its own means to set them free, alluding to a possible attack against Lebanese armed forces.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The Islamic State and Fatah al-Islam</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>According to reports, Monther Khaldoun al-Hassan, a Lebanese resident from Akkar, is suspected of provisioning suicide bombers and other ISIS networks in Lebanon with suicide belts and explosives. General Security circulated a photo of Hassan, who is believed to be operating under Ordoni&rsquo;s leadership. Information leaked to Lebanese media outlets suggests that Hassan is a resident of Tripoli, though it seems few Tripoli residents know him.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A Syrian man with ties to locals who have fought alongside Syrian opposition groups,&nbsp;currently living in Tripoli, told NOW that Hassan comes from a family of militant jihadists. His brother Moatasem, he said, was the first Lebanese to execute a suicide bombing in Syria, detonating himself at a Syrian army checkpoint in Talkalakh last year. A second brother was killed in clashes that followed the attack. Hassan&rsquo;s uncle, Khaled Mahmoud, also referred to as &ldquo;Abu Suleiman,&rdquo; was leader of the Jund al-Sham group in Qalat al-Hosn in Talkalakh. Two other uncles fought with Fatah al-Islam in the Nahr al-Bared conflict in 2007 &ndash; one is believed to be the militant who blew himself up in the Tripoli raid that paved the way for the clashes, and the other has been arrested for similar charges and is currently in Roumieh prison.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The Syrian national, who preferred to remain anonymous for security reasons, told NOW that Hassan initially travelled to Syria to join Jabhat al-Nusra, but left Nusra to join ISIS under Ordoni&rsquo;s leadership. Men like Hassan, he said, who travel to Syria to fight alongside opposition groups, also tend to support ISIS.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Brothers in arms: the 2003 Iraq war</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Sitting outside his corner store, a middle-aged man who goes by the name Abu Mohamad observes passersby as they rush from one store to another shopping before Iftar. Somewhat reluctantly, he tells NOW that &ldquo;to understand the relation between ISIS and Fatah al-Islam you need to go back in time to the [2003] Iraq war.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Retired from security forces, Abu Mohamad, who is of Palestinian origin and had close ties to Palestinian factions living inside Nahr al-Bared, says Fatah al-Islam had previously fought in Iraq under the leadership of infamous al-Qaeda member Abu Musab al-Zarqawi. Returning to Lebanon, the group and their leader, Shaker al-Abbsi, as well as youths he met in Iraq &ndash; Lebanese, Syrians and Palestinians &ndash; set themselves up in Fatah Al-Intifada&rsquo;s headquarters in western Bekaa, and then headed for Nahr al-Bared camp in northern Lebanon.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;The idea of ISIS,&rdquo; Abu Mohamad says, &ldquo;was one propagated by Zarqawi&rsquo;s group in Iraq. Thanks to modern-day technology,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;the group was able to reconnect with what was left of the old fighters who were either in hiding or are serving time in Roumieh prison.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Zarqawi, a militant Islamist from Jordan, began coordinating the entry of al-Qaeda operatives into Iraq through Syria shortly before the invasion of Iraq in March 2003. By the Fall of year, a steady flow of Arab Islamists were infiltrating Iraq, Lebanese fighters among them. &ldquo;Sheikh al-Qaa'qaa, an imam from Aleppo,&rdquo; says Abu Mohamad &ldquo;called for jihad publically, and every Friday he would give fiery sermons and then fill the buses with men, and send them straight over into Iraq.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Jihadists infiltrated by Syrian regime intelligence</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>One month into the Syrian people&rsquo;s uprising against President Bashar al Assad&rsquo;s regime, the government freed over 200 political prisoners, including Islamists and Kurds, from the notorious Saydnaya prison in Damascus. Maher Esber, then a political prisoner and now a political activist, fled Syria to Lebanon. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>According to Esber, and based on his cell mates&rsquo; personal accounts, the Syrian regime was well aware of the flow of jihadists into Iraq and at times even coordinated their safe passage. One Islamist, he said, talked of how the military and political security branches distributed permits to jihadists allowing them to cross military checkpoints from Syria into Iraq in cars and vans carrying armor. A Lebanese inmate spoke of how the Lebanese were being recruited by Baath party members.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Among the stories, he says, was one about a militant group called Jund al-Sham, formed by five Syrians who were close to Zarqawi. Near the end of 2004, and after their success in Iraq, they proposed to Zarqawi that they carry out similar operations in Syria. Zarqawi advised them not to, but they decided to anyway, and began liaising with Ghazi Kenaan, Syria&rsquo;s interior minister at the time. &ldquo;Syrian intelligence knew what they were up to and killed them all,&rdquo; said Esber, &ldquo;along with Kenaan, with the exception of one of the five founders, whose name was Abu Abdallah al-Zamel.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Esber explained that Zamel would often accuse Fatah al-Islam inmates of being spies for the regime. Shaker al-Abssi, he would say, is believed to have been released from Syrian prison for the purpose of forming a militant group that would destabilize Lebanon.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;One of our inmates was a Syrian intelligence operative,&rdquo; said Esber. &ldquo;He worked closely with Jamil al-Hassan, Jawiya [Air Force Brigade] intelligence chief at the time. He was tasked with infiltrating the Fatah al-Islam group. He was embedded with them for months and was gathering information about their activities.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Apart from leadership,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;members of Fatah al-Islam were not aware that their high-ranking members were coordinating closely with the Syrian regime&rsquo;s intelligence.&rdquo; &nbsp;</p><p>                                      Sources say Shaker Al-Abbsi was released by the Syrian regime to destabilize Lebanon.

Determined atheists that we both are, as the Black Label bottle steadily drained our conversation turned, as it often would, to the evergreen subject of the woefully elevated positions of the region&rsquo;s Parties of God in all their forms and guises.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Man, let me show you something,&rdquo; he suddenly said, reaching for the TV remote. &ldquo;This is why the secularists can&rsquo;t beat the Islamists today.&rdquo; Flicking to one of at least a dozen available Islamic channels, we listened as a shrouded televangelist expounded on the boundless splendors of the pious path. &ldquo;Just listen to the guy&rsquo;s fusha [classical Arabic],&rdquo; my friend said in sincere admiration. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s effortless.&rdquo; And so it was &ndash; without the slightest stutter or pause, our imam filled the room with the music of 7th -century Arabian vocabulary, every single letter adorned with precisely the correct diacritical flourish. Picture someone mellifluously chatting in the tongue of Shakespeare and you&rsquo;ll get something of the oratorical effect.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Now compare that with these guys,&rdquo; said my friend, switching to a political talk show featuring two beardless Jordanians in suits. Clearly ill-at-ease in the fusha they were compelled (by widely-observed custom) to speak on air &ndash; which is likely the only time they speak it &ndash; the contrast in style was disastrous. In awkward monotone, they would punctuate every other word with an &ldquo;uhhh&rdquo; as they frantically scanned their limited mental lexicons for the formally proper noun or adjective. &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter that what they&rsquo;re saying is a thousand times more enlightening than the Islamist propaganda,&rdquo; my friend said. &ldquo;Who could listen to this for more than thirty seconds?&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>That thought came rushing back to me on Saturday when I watched another Islamist, the fugitive cleric-cum-militiaman Ahmad al-Assir, mount an 11-minute-long diatribe  against the &ldquo;liberals&rdquo; (what contempt he put into the word) of Lebanon&rsquo;s moderate Sunni Future Movement. Secure in his amply-demonstrated fusha proficiency, Assir actually reverted to colloquial dialect to land his most personal jab, directed at Future leader Saad Hariri, &ldquo;who doesn&rsquo;t know how to string two words together in Arabic.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s a reference to the former prime minister&rsquo;s famously shaky fusha, most memorably demonstrated in a calamitous  2009 parliament address. But Assir wasn&rsquo;t trying to score literary points: he meant to undermine Hariri&rsquo;s religious, and ultimately political, legitimacy as the representative of Lebanon&rsquo;s Sunnis. It was an assertion of the supposed authenticity, the unshakeable Arabness, of Islamism compared to effete and decadent liberalism.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Older generations of Arab nationalist intellectuals championed the revival and protection of Arabic out of fear that &ldquo;the nation&rdquo; and its culture were losing ground to an ascendant West. Today, the new and graver danger is of young Arab minds being seduced by hyper-articulate jihadists, to whose rhetorical charms even this British kafir is not entirely invulnerable.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Among other things, this makes all the more necessary the secular Arabic literary heritage, from the classic pre-Islamic mu`allaqat through such brilliant medieval reprobates as Abu Nuwas to modern giants like Mahmoud Darwish. Indeed, there&rsquo;s reason to believe a thread running through the entire oeuvre of the permanently clean-shaven Darwish, who never hid his dislike of Hamas and lamented those who &ldquo;don&rsquo;t know the difference between the mosque (al-jam`) and the university (al-jam`a),&rdquo; was an unspoken determination to claim Arabic (and specifically classical Arabic, the clerics&rsquo; home ground) for an avowedly secular renaissance, or nahda. (The contribution of those who manage to turn these works into music and other art forms &ndash; Marcel Khalif&eacute; being perhaps the most obvious example &ndash; is also invaluable, not least because of the profanity of music in and of itself in the Wahhabist worldview. One recalls Khalif&eacute;&rsquo;s farcical 1999 blasphemy trial.) Unless and until that is achieved, the Islamists will continue to exploit the appearance of an intellectual &ndash; and even cultural &ndash; superiority that is of course entirely and dangerously illusory.</p><p>                                      Ahmad al-Assir addressing an audience (Source: saidaonline.com)                                   </p><p>                                      Assir wasn’t trying to score literary points: he meant to undermine Hariri’s religious, and ultimately political, legitimacy as the representative of Lebanon’s Sunnis"                                   </p>";s:17:"post_image_height";i:394;s:16:"post_image_width";i:616;s:11:"post_visits";i:8;s:18:"post_twitterShares";i:71;s:19:"post_facebookShares";i:229;s:16:"post_totalShares";i:300;s:16:"post_socialScore";i:31;s:13:"post_virality";i:46;s:9:"blog_name";N;s:16:"blog_description";N;s:8:"blog_url";N;s:11:"blog_author";N;s:28:"blog_author_twitter_username";N;s:13:"blog_rss_feed";N;s:9:"blog_tags";N;s:2:"id";N;s:11:"blog_active";N;s:24:"blog_last_post_timestamp";N;s:6:"col_id";i:9;s:8:"col_name";s:22:"Alex Rowell (NOW Blog)";s:16:"col_media_source";s:17:"Now Lebanon Blogs";s:13:"col_home_page";s:46:"https://now.mmedia.me/lb/en/Author/Alex.Rowell";s:13:"col_shorthand";s:14:"alexrowell-now";s:26:"col_media_source_shorthand";s:11:"now_lebanon";s:27:"col_author_twitter_username";s:13:"disgraceofgod";s:8:"col_tags";s:8:"politics";s:15:"col_description";s:151:"Alex Rowell joined NOW in Beirut as a reporter and blogger in February 2012.

<p><strong>How is it that the world has lost so much of its sight, compassion and ability to see the tragedies that are befalling Palestinian civilians? Worse off, how is the media portraying the two sides as equals? Watch the video, because it comes out so much better when a Jew says it. </strong></p>

<p><strong>Then we have this kid; this brave, gentle, young activist who made it all the way from the United States to stand up for the Palestinians, only to be bullied by the Israeli police. </strong></p>
<p>This brave, young Jewish man stood alone in the middle of the street wearing a Palestinian kuffiyeh around his neck and a Jewish kippah on his head voicing his discontent with the occupation of Palestinian land by Israeli settlers. </p>

<p><strong>I read somewhere on the internet a couple of days ago a quote allegedly said by a Gazan that read something like this: </strong></p>
<p>“If I die tonight, take whatever good organs are left in my body and donate them to those in need, but my middle finger? Give that to the Arabs.”</p>
<p>I couldn’t agree more. </p>

<p><strong>Let us just hold prayer to those trapped in the prison that is Gaza, but also let us spread the word on the atrocities befalling the strip and those who are continually marginalized by mainstream media, those who are protesting the offensive dubbed by Israeli authorities “Operation Protective Edge”…the irony.</strong>  </p>

Of course this doesn’t reflect dominant public opinion in the West that still is apologetic of Israel’s actions. Not one official state declaration has condemned the Israeli attacks. If anything, the few who bothered to issue a statement reiterated Israel’s right to defend itself as it was perceived to live under a constant threat of rocket shower. <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2014/07/world-reacts-conflict-gaza-201471073217736666.html" target="_blank">Check here</a> if you want to have goose bumps.</p>
<p>But there is one place where no demonstrations are in sight: the Arab world. Also, not one condemnation was issued by any Arab government, not one declaration. It is taken for granted that no Western government has condoned Israeli attacks either. But how can we explain this apathy sweeping the Arab region? Surely, they have their own problems all linked to one or other form of occupation. But this conflict used to be called the Israeli-Arab conflict for crying out loud!</p>
<p>A couple of centuries ago, the situation in the region looked very similar: the crusaders were well entrenched on the coast of the “fertile crescent”, and the rest of the Muslim world was completely paralyzed, accepting, if not complicit, in the status quo of occupation until Nur ad-din and his successor Saladin challenged the paradigm. This is at least what the history books say. Some of this dominant cultural apathy or nonchalance, the surrender and normalization, must have existed so that these two individuals and the movements they represented have gone down in the books as changing the face of history.</p>
<p>Modern Arabs have not used their historical consciousness as an agent of ideological change or political action. The basic nationalistic experiments that were fashioned by colonial encounters left Arabs struggling over questions of terminology and then categorizing history in one way or another. Devising points of reference and of origin. The crusades episode was barely glossed over (until now the only book that presents an interesting take on that episode is Amin Maalouf’s. That tells you about the state of the literature).</p>
<p>On one hand, Arab leftist movements were too busy looking towards a brighter socially more “evolved” future and being ashamed of their Islamic heritage, helplessly wanting to teach social and political “progress” of the West. On the other hand, nationalist movements were quarreling amongst each other finding all kinds of identitarian anchors to justify their causes (the Omayyad period was a favorite as it looked the most “secular”, but also anything pre-Islamic).</p>
<p>No one thought of approaching history as giving lessons for political practice. More recently but still a couple of centuries ago, the “Renaissance” Italian writer Machiavelli looked at the history of the Roman Empire in this particular vein as he hoped to provide advice to unite the various Princedoms feuding over Italy. Interestingly, Machiavelli was categorized as ushering a new era of thinking politics outside the scope of religion, a state that had lasted since the advent of Catholic Christianity in Europe.</p>
<p>In modern times, we have fallen in to the trap of categorizing Machiavelli a secular thinker as opposed to one that was just opposed to dominant categories of analysis that happened to be held at the time by the Catholic Church with its particular understanding of history. The point of thinkers such as Machiavelli was to say that the Catholic Church could not provide the needed leverage to create political unity. Ideologically speaking, there was a need to produce new categories of thinking. Machiavelli called for a new political science, one that does away with traditional categories of analysis, not because they were bad or “backward”, but because the institutions backing them did not have anymore the means to create new political realities.</p>
<p>All this is to say that Arabs have been obsessed with categorizing things as either secular or religious as intellectuals of all creeds desperately clung on to the categories of colonial heritage. How could they have done otherwise? The colonizer had also captured their texts and by this token had controlled the creation of knowledge emanating from these writings! The primary victim of this reversed Orientalism espoused by Arabs was historical consciousness. The past became a cumbersome process that was only used to create identities, differences and reactionary discourse and not be a repository for good action.</p>
<p>The rise of Political Islam was a direct reaction to this awkward and clumsy attitude towards history. Suddenly the past was all important. But what kind of past? For example, during the Lebanese “civil war”, the crusader episode was visited in history by various Muslim groups but only to identify them to the contemporary Lebanese Christians who they were fighting between 1975 and 1990. Even though one could retrieve lessons in political practice from these uses of the past they were also creating group differentiation (here Christian VS Muslims).</p>
<p>And every time history was revised it was to create identitarian differences. Such as fomenting trouble between Sunni and Shia denominated groups. Books and articles, talk-shows and documentaries, all proliferate on relentless questions and searches of authenticity, developing either an alleged Sunni or Shia take on the Islamic tradition. No wonder we’ve been busied away from other conflicts.</p>
<p>As I looked for what was written on Nur ad-din, most of what I found was how much he was a great Sunni leader who opposed Shia Fatimid Egypt of the time. In effect, this is not incorrect. But that’s not what the prevailing historians of the time want us to remember, at least in the aftermath of the defeat against the crusaders. The point here is not that the “right” conflict is looking for the right identity to conflict with. The point is to look at the location of forms of occupation, oppression, unjust violence, etc. and understand how to remedy that through the legacy of others who did before us. How can one create the necessary form of consciousness through learning from the past in order to produce community change?</p>
<p>With technological revolutions and every single group or individual having a media channel of his own this ideological rallying is an immense challenge. It is ironic that Arabs are said to be closer to democracy or accountability given that they don’t even pressure their government to do something about Palestine. Is this a sign of apathy, a change of heart, or just a failure to understand and return the debt to the past?</p><br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/remarkz.wordpress.com/4826/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/remarkz.wordpress.com/4826/"></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=remarkz.wordpress.com&blog=3584669&post=4826&subd=remarkz&ref=&feed=1" width="1" height="1">";s:17:"post_image_height";i:0;s:16:"post_image_width";i:0;s:11:"post_visits";i:0;s:18:"post_twitterShares";i:0;s:19:"post_facebookShares";i:0;s:16:"post_totalShares";i:0;s:16:"post_socialScore";i:1;s:13:"post_virality";i:2;s:9:"blog_name";s:7:"Remarkz";s:16:"blog_description";s:62:"Footnotes on what came to be called the Middle East and beyond";s:8:"blog_url";s:28:"http://remarkz.wordpress.com";s:11:"blog_author";s:7:"Remarkz";s:28:"blog_author_twitter_username";N;s:13:"blog_rss_feed";s:34:"http://remarkz.wordpress.com/feed/";s:9:"blog_tags";s:8:"politics";s:2:"id";i:119;s:11:"blog_active";i:1;s:24:"blog_last_post_timestamp";i:1405677120;s:6:"col_id";N;s:8:"col_name";N;s:16:"col_media_source";N;s:13:"col_home_page";N;s:13:"col_shorthand";N;s:26:"col_media_source_shorthand";N;s:27:"col_author_twitter_username";N;s:8:"col_tags";N;s:15:"col_description";N;s:23:"col_last_post_timestamp";N;}i:16;O:8:"stdClass":36:{s:7:"post_id";i:32808;s:8:"post_url";s:77:"http://stateofmind13.com/2014/07/16/those-worthless-lives-of-the-middle-east/";s:10:"post_title";s:40:"Those Worthless Lives Of The Middle East";s:10:"post_image";s:78:"https://stateofmind13.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/20140716-101141-36701741.jpg";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:123:"Those worthless people of Gaza.

<p><strong>Those worthless people of Gaza.</strong> How many have died since Tuesday? It doesn’t even matter but I’ll list the number anyway: 154, and those 154 people don’t matter. Some will chant praises to their martyrdom and others will lament how their lives were lost, but they are but a number in a conflict that won’t end, a number to be buried deep in the Arab subconscious between seasons of Arab Idol, Ahla Sot and Elissa’s albums. Gaza was still an open air prison a few years ago and it will remain an open air prison a few years from now. It’s just only remembered at specific instants when their going gets slightly tougher. We get infuriated at the hypocrisy that Israel killing Arabs includes when its entire existence can be taken back, in one way or another, to Western guilt over the Jewish holocaust. But when you come to think of it, are Arabs even entitled to be sad for the people of Gaza who are dying, whose homes are being demolished just so muscles can be flexed and whose deaths are being ridiculed on certain TV channels just because they don’t fit with the rhetoric of the axis currently ruling the world? How are the people of Gaza dying exactly? Is it Israeli planes? Or is it the Arab oil fueling those planes? Or is it the Arab silent towards Israeli plans? Or is it those Arabs making sure their borders with Gaza stay closed, securing that open air prison until who knows when? Or is it the Arab slumber that only finds mild wakefulness sporadically, in Twitter or Facebook hashtags, never trying to speak out against their own regimes, in bed with those killing the people of Gaza, because they are providing them with the biggest mall on Earth and a great shopping experience to boot?</p>
<p><strong>Those worthless people of Syria.</strong> How many Syrians have died in the past 3 or so years? How many digits has that number reached by now? As is the case with Gaza, this too doesn’t even matter, but I’ll list it anyway: 170,000. That six digit figure comprises entire families, men, women, children who will never have the future that a few years back was rightfully theirs. The biggest injustice, however, towards those Syrians isn’t just that their death, in the grand scheme of things, might not actually matter, but the fact that their deaths are also not an absolute truth among the Arabs infuriated by Israel’s actions. How many of those crying over Gaza now actually cared as the toll in Syria rose from one digit to the next? How many of those crying wolf over ABC, BBC, CNN or MTV Lebanon actually watch TV stations that do the exact same thing to those people of Syria? Those six digit lives are nothing more than a bargaining chip in a conflict that is greater than they’ll ever be individually. Those lives don’t fit with their grand political scheme of choice and are a mere tool in the attempt to stop the big bad Sunni monster.</p>
<p><strong>Those worthless people of Lebanon.</strong> There’s no estimate of those that died between 1975 and 2014. Our parents had hoped way back when they decided to stay in this country that things would get better for us, with all the lives lost to fight for causes that they believed in. But things are still the same. Young men and women fought for causes and died only to have the people they fought for forget them the moment a glimpse of power flashed in front of their eyes. And things are still the same today. From one explosion to the next, from burned flesh on Beirut’s asphalt to spoiled breakfasts in Tripoli, to acts defending the country against armies now killing innocents in Gaza, the lives of our countrymen being lost are also simple digits that will keep on adding up until who knows when because we never learn.</p>
<p>The causes are not similar, and the conflicts are not the same. But the people involved are dying with one thing in common: their deaths only serve to escalate numbers without changing anything. How many had to die in Gaza before the collective Arab consciousness decided to budge, before the Arab league figured it should convene or before Egypt figured it should come up with a ceasefire plan with their BFFs? How many more have to die until it is realized that the current status quo regarding the region’s countries and regarding the attitude towards Israel does not simply work? When will Arabs learn that building the world’s tallest structure, biggest artificial island and hosting the World Cup aren’t what really matter when their own people are being slaughtered like sheep right on their doorstep as they sit around and eat their fancy iftars on this bloody Ramadan?</p>
<p>I am a 24 year old Lebanese who lives in a country of violence in a sea of even more violence, and I do not know how to be violent. I do not believe violence is the key to any solution for this region, but I am one of very few voices in a culture that sings weapons in song, brands them on flags and salutes the world with them as they chant takbirs for everyone to hear, a culture that, for instance, doesn’t really want to see Palestine free as much as go to heaven as martyrs for that purpose.</p>
<p>There are a lot of things that we are not allowed to do towards those countries. We can’t do like that Norwegian doctor and visit Gaza to help in whatever way we can. Protesting the regimes of the countries filling this region has also become a dangerous matter even though those tyrant regimes do much worse to their own people than possibly even Israel, regardless of whether such a notion is even entertained by people of the region or not. The only thing we are left with is our voices and platforms to express those voices and try to change perspectives, but does the region even have a clear plan towards using modern day media in order to fight the Israeli rampage? Is there a way for us to get a clear message across when we can’t even agree on what that message should be? Are we not also losing the war of information and misinformation that, in this day and age, has become as tactically important as rockets and blasts and tanks especially with the looming threat of treason over our heads when the message we need to get across is  to those whose existence we are not allowed to acknowledge? Is there a way for us to make the lives lost in the countries of the region slightly less worthless than they are as we remain completely and irrevocably lost, unable to do anything about it but be angry about biased media reporting, portrayals of the people dying as terrorists and the blindness of a world that never really had sight to begin with?</p>
<p>May all those people’s pieces rest in peace.</p><br>Filed under: <a href="http://stateofmind13.com/category/politics-2/">Politics</a>, <a href="http://stateofmind13.com/category/life-2/thoughts/">Thoughts</a>  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/stateofmind13.wordpress.com/11230/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/stateofmind13.wordpress.com/11230/"></a> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/godelicious/stateofmind13.wordpress.com/11230/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/delicious/stateofmind13.wordpress.com/11230/"></a> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gofacebook/stateofmind13.wordpress.com/11230/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/facebook/stateofmind13.wordpress.com/11230/"></a> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gotwitter/stateofmind13.wordpress.com/11230/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/twitter/stateofmind13.wordpress.com/11230/"></a> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gostumble/stateofmind13.wordpress.com/11230/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/stumble/stateofmind13.wordpress.com/11230/"></a> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/godigg/stateofmind13.wordpress.com/11230/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/digg/stateofmind13.wordpress.com/11230/"></a> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/goreddit/stateofmind13.wordpress.com/11230/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/reddit/stateofmind13.wordpress.com/11230/"></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=stateofmind13.com&blog=19416533&post=11230&subd=stateofmind13&ref=&feed=1" width="1" height="1">";s:17:"post_image_height";i:554;s:16:"post_image_width";i:846;s:11:"post_visits";i:17;s:18:"post_twitterShares";i:5;s:19:"post_facebookShares";i:87;s:16:"post_totalShares";i:92;s:16:"post_socialScore";i:35;s:13:"post_virality";i:36;s:9:"blog_name";s:24:"A Separate State of Mind";s:16:"blog_description";N;s:8:"blog_url";s:24:"http://stateofmind13.com";s:11:"blog_author";s:10:"Elie Fares";s:28:"blog_author_twitter_username";s:9:"eliefares";s:13:"blog_rss_feed";s:30:"http://stateofmind13.com/feed/";s:9:"blog_tags";s:17:"politics, society";s:2:"id";i:134;s:11:"blog_active";i:1;s:24:"blog_last_post_timestamp";i:1405494780;s:6:"col_id";N;s:8:"col_name";N;s:16:"col_media_source";N;s:13:"col_home_page";N;s:13:"col_shorthand";N;s:26:"col_media_source_shorthand";N;s:27:"col_author_twitter_username";N;s:8:"col_tags";N;s:15:"col_description";N;s:23:"col_last_post_timestamp";N;}i:17;O:8:"stdClass":36:{s:7:"post_id";i:32811;s:8:"post_url";s:78:"http://ritachemaly.wordpress.com/2014/07/16/do-you-know-the-other-personality/";s:10:"post_title";s:33:"Do you know the Other Personality";s:10:"post_image";s:98:"http://ritachemaly.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/16-personalities-which-one-are-you-test-chemaly.jpg";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:123:"2 weeks ago I was attending a training aiming at launching a campaign to empower women economically.

<p> </p>
<p><b>Why was REDAL created?</b></p>
<p><span>We created an association that aims at pooling the major developers in an effort to better communicate our role to various governmental and other economic parties, as well as the public at large. </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>What’s your take on new tax proposals?</b></p>
<p><span>We suffer more indirect taxes, I believe, than any other sector.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>How so?</b></p>
<p><span>Stamp fees, registration fees, permits. When we have archeological inspections to go through, we foot the whole bill. We suffer V.A.T. on construction. We don’t recover it. [In a project my company is working on, indirect taxes] will account for 30 to 35 percent of the overall project cost. </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Is getting all of the paperwork in order to start a project complicated?</b></p>
<p>Yes. We go through municipalities. We go through the urban planning bodies, including the central one. We go through several other paths from the department of electricity, to EDL, to other services. It really should be one. At least there should be some coordination body where you know what you need to do and how to get it done. All of these procedures, instead of getting simpler, are getting more complicated. The world is going digital, but the government is not. Not in terms of construction permits.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span><b>So how long does it take and what do you have to do to get a construction permit?</b></span></p>
<p><span>Essentially there should be two [bodies to deal with]: There should be the municipality and there should be, in some instances, at least where big projects are involved urban planning. To go to either, you go through the Order of Engineers. If you’re developing downtown, in the area controlled by Solidere, you have to go through Solidere as well. Then you have [even more offices to visit] … These [procedures] are not only costly, they’re complicated and they create uncertainty in terms of timeframes. For instance, it’s such a bureaucratic process — I must have been involved in 15 projects, maybe more, since I’ve come back, and I don’t think there has been one where I haven’t learned a new turn … I haven’t seen anyone who defends the system. Not the mayor of Beirut, not the head of the Directorate General of Urbanism, not the head of the order of engineers. </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>What’s the solution?</b></p>
<p><span>We need one body. One body to go to. </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>In terms of monitoring construction, are there enough state inspectors to make sure projects are being built safely and in line with the laws on the books?</b></p>
<p><span>I truly believe the quality of construction has improved. It has certainly improved in the up-market sector.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Is that because of a private sector initiative or because of more inspectors or better inspection?</b></p>
<p>I think it’s unrelated to codes, at least to Lebanese law codes. I think it happened because the reconstruction of Beirut was led by the Solidere effort, and I think you could notice in the 1990s how buildings around Solidere, [in some areas] started looking better … in terms of quality of construction. Also, there are more professional developers now.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>But has there been improvement in inspection and monitoring?</b></p>
<p><span>The government is doing its part. They are now insisting that … [developers] employ something called Bureau de Controle. For fire safety, for such issues, it’s a review of design and implementation but I believe the private sector has a bigger role. Yes the laws are there on all levels … But, to be honest, I don’t see a deterioration in the quality of construction. I see a proliferation, in some parts, in middle-income developments, that are substandard in some aspects. I don’t find it dangerous, but I find waterproofing to be of terrible quality, [for example]. </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>While the government may be doing its job on that front, planning is still a problem in that no one seems to be doing it. Is it too late for urban planning?</b></p>
<p><span>I used to think it was … There are efforts on the part of some of the municipalities to tackle these things, and it’s working. But even they have to go through other bodies, and it’s taking a long time.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Are you pushing legislative fixes for any of the issues you have with the sector?</b></p>
<p><span>Legislation is very important for many things, and we’re finding, for instance, in the fees and tax issues, that it’s more to do with legislation than with policy and policymakers. But I personally believe that, in general, the problem with development in this country, or from the government side, is that the laws are archaic and I think we need more planning than regulation … I don’t think laws can replace planning. And I think that you can criticize Solidere for many things, but there are things that a master planner can do which laws cannot. We need to address these urban disasters and deal with them. And we have to develop around the villages and not destroy the villages themselves. </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>How do we weed out corruption?</b></p>
<p><span>In the last two years, it’s gotten pretty bad. It’s always been, you know. But it’s gotten worse because the economy has weakened, I suppose and because governance has gone to new lows. I do not know where to begin in addressing these issues … From my experience, the corruption does not help you pay less than what is fair [in taxes and fees] … My solution is simply the process. Create one assessment body for all properties and somebody or some committee to appeal to in case there’s something wrong. You can’t deal with 15 bodies when you don’t know why and who and how … I can’t see why it is so hard. I would say simplify the process and find a more objective way of measuring the fees. And look a little more long-term-ish as lawmakers, in terms of understanding the implications of the laws you create and of how simplifying these laws and these measures [can help] … I don’t think the solution is so much for us to fight it as much as it is to continually remind them and say, “Let’s talk about making it all fairer, making it all simpler.” We’re not saying we don’t want to pay. The system is organized enough that nobody can escape paying, no matter what the impression is. We don’t bribe our way and pay less. We ease the documents process because one has to, but that’s besides the real problem.</span></p>

They help us better understand our world and ourselves, especially at complex times such as this latest round of military attacks by Israelis and Palestinians.</p><p>The prevalent global analysis of the fighting is inadequate for anyone who seeks seriously to grasp the three critical dimensions of the fighting – its causes, nature and consequences. </p><p>None of those three dimensions is addressed by the facile nature of politicians’ statements or mainstream media analysis, which tend to emphasize rockets fired by Palestinians from Gaza, Israel’s right to defend itself against such attacks, and speculation about a possible cease-fire or an imminent Israeli ground attack into Gaza.</p><p>Words can help, and in this case it is worthwhile to examine the words that Palestinians use to describe themselves, if we are seriously interested in understanding the core issues that define this conflict. These have manifested themselves since the 1930s in so many different ways, all leading back to a basic issue: The battle between Zionism  and Arabism in Palestine, more particularly the battle between the rights of a Jewish-majority state of Israel and a dismembered and exiled Palestinian community that continues to struggle for its national rights.</p><p>The two leading Palestinian political and military groups that have mobilized their supporters over the past decades are Fatah  and Hamas.  Fatah was founded and for a long time headed by Yasser Arafat, and controls the Palestine  National Authority that manages the West Bank under Israeli tutelage. Hamas came into being in the early 1980s and has dominated the Gaza Strip  for several years now. </p><p> Fatah is a peculiar acronym that comprises, in reverse order, the first three letters of the movement’s name in Arabic, which is Harakat Tahrir Filistin, or the  Palestine Liberation Movement. Hamas is an acronym in Arabic for its full name, which is Harakat al-Muqawama al-Islamiyya, or the Islamic Resistance Movement. The two most important words in their names are “tahrir” and “muqawama,” or “liberation” and “resistance.” In the etymology of Palestinian nationalism, “liberation” and “resistance” are enduring emotional sentiments and political dynamics, because they largely define the nature of Palestinian identity and goals. They are the most important things to understand about how Palestinians feel and behave.</p><p>The once-dominant and vital  Fatah movement has become a sad shell of its former self, with some very bright and patriotic leaders who have totally lost touch with their people in  Palestine and abroad. Hamas has risen to the fore in recent decades mainly because it has more faithfully reflected the will of Palestinians to resist their occupation and subjugation, and to seek liberation and a normal life in their own sovereign state. Hamas’ core mission is “resistance,” whether through military actions that have little impact on Israel or by trying to organize Palestinians politically to improve their living conditions while they await eventual liberation.</p><p>Hamas is a heroic tragedy, simultaneously admirable and sorrowful. It is heroic for many Palestinians because it persists in resisting Zionism’s desire to eliminate Palestinian nationalism and identity as real forces that demand respect and can be manifested in some kind of national sovereignty in Palestine. “Resistance” to Hamas supporters and others means many things at once. It means consistently asserting the Palestinians’ national rights and the need to end their refugee status. It means constantly challenging the oppressive status quo that Palestinians suffer, especially in Gaza. It means consistently increasing Hamas’ technical capabilities in rockets, drones and communications, allowing it to inconvenience Israel more effectively with every new round of fighting.</p><p>Yet Hamas is also tragic because its strategy and tactics both result in repeated mass suffering by Palestinian civilians in the  Gaza Strip and sometimes elsewhere as well. The state of Israel, being the sovereign manifestation of Zionism, has repeatedly shown that it will viciously attack, assassinate, imprison and imperil all Palestinians – in Palestine, Lebanon or elsewhere – to maintain its hold on the land of Palestine. It is possible that Hamas’ long-term strategy of patient steadfastness and continuous resistance will succeed one day in forcing Israel to accept its terms, but that remains only a slim possibility, while the reality is that millions of Palestinians suffer the burden of repeated Israeli attacks on their homes and communities.</p><p>Exiled and subjugated communities such as the Palestinians today usually behave in ways that seem strange to middle class consumers in faraway lands – including fighting apparently futile battles and subjecting their populations to prolonged suffering and death. This can only be understood by appreciating the nature of “resistance” and the allure of “liberation.” That means analyzing the Israeli-Palestinian conflict as a battle between Zionist power and Palestinian liberation that has gone on for almost a century. </p><p>Rami G.
