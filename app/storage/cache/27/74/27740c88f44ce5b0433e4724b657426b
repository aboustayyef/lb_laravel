<p>Overall, two benchmark indices rose, three were flat and seven fell. All markets in the Gulf Coordination Council dropped, save the Omani bourse which was flat. Excluding the GCC and Egypt, there were no signs of any strong market direction in the remainder of MENA.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.executive-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/indices-week-21.png"><img alt="Stock index performance" src="http://www.executive-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/indices-week-21.png" width="300" height="522"></a></p>
<p>As to the year-to-date picture, the Dubai market is still the solid ‘el supremo’ in terms of percentage gains but its rate of improvement receded to 47.5 percent by end of the week, followed by the Qatar Exchange at almost 31 percent and the EGX 30, which also leapt beyond 30 percent when compared with the start of 2014.</p>
<p><strong>Clueless in the Gulf</strong></p>
<p>Even as the actual inclusion of the selected stocks in Qatar and the United Arab Emirates in the MSCI Emerging Markets Index is yet to become effective, a first round of opportunistic selling and booking of gains in the markets of Dubai, Abu Dhabi and Doha cannot surprise.</p>
<p>The QE Index ended the week after the announcement of its ten MSCI EM joiners with a net drop of just 0.8 percent, but the index moved below the 13,000 points line on three of the week’s five trading days before ending the period with a 250 point uptick. The ADX’s corresponding ride drove the index south for three sessions before a partial recovery.</p>
<p>Abu Dhabi’s weekly net loss was 1.9 percent, which still looks benign when compared with the Dubai market. The DFM Index got slammed down a solid 10 percent by fast sellers in the first three sessions of the week before regaining 200 points and closing week 21 a bit better at −6.1 percent.</p>
<p>Accounting for about two thirds of activity on the DFM, real estate and construction stocks drove the market in Dubai, with financial stocks accounting for most of the remaining activity. Emaar, Arabtec, Union Properties, and Dubai Islamic Bank were among the most pressured. Banking and real estate companies were key contributors to activity on the ADX as well, where banks NBAD and FGB fell by 3.9 percent and 5.3 percent in week 21; real estate stock Aldar dropped 7.6 percent in the same period.</p>
<p>In property and banking and on both UAE exchanges, the attention was firmly focused on stocks that were most affected by the MSCI EM announcements at the end of week 20, either because they were included or had been expected to and failed to make the cut.</p>
<p>As their markets danced the volatility quickstep, newspaper interviews with equity analysts in Dubai and Abu Dhabi pointed to a firm consensus of uncertainty on near-term market developments and possibilities of a correction after the strong gains seen since the start of 2013.</p>
<p>In Qatar, the MSCI EM joiners in banking and manufacturing were more interesting to watch than real estate joiner Barwa; Qatar National Bank and Industries Qatar dropped in the four percent range and Commercial Bank of Qatar by almost three percent during the week as Barwa moved down less than one percent.</p>
<p>The Saudi and Bahraini markets, positioned at the opposing poles of the GCC size spectrum, each moved through the week in general alignment with the drop and partial recovery path of the aforementioned bourses. The markets in Kuwait and Oman inversely exhibited more optimism in the middle of the week and recorded index drops towards the end of the week.</p>
<p>There was something of an update from the policy front as the Kuwait Capital Market Authority released a statement about plans by the Gulf Cooperation Council’s heads of capital markets, which convened in Kuwait for a regular committee meeting to discuss collaboration of GCC stock exchanges.</p>
<p>“The [capital markets] committee approved the [disclosure and governance] committee’s suggestions for single stock disclosure rules and uniform corporate governance principles,” said Kuwait’s state news agency, KUNA, after the meeting concluded on May 19. Appeals for greater integration of GCC stock markets are a recurrent theme in the six states’ attempts to power up their capital markets beyond the current fragmented scenario.</p>
<p><strong>Whiffs of election fever?</strong></p>
<p>Stock exchanges react vigorously to innovative shocks and duly so because the predictable market valuation of a cart maker, for example, will be changed after the invention of a better transportation device such as a bicycle. But events with unpredictable outcomes — such as political elections — sometimes seem to get bigger responses than warranted.</p>
<p>A recent example for hyped market expectations from political elections came from India where the Sensex index of the Bombay Stock Exchange rallied 9.7 percent between the beginning of May and last Friday. This rise, taking place in parallel with the national elections and reacting to the win of the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party, is a bet on a stronger economic future based on a political change. Yet due to India’s complex development process, one must ask if the bet isn’t larger than what can be reasonably predicted.</p>
<p>A similar scenario seems to be playing out in Egypt where the stock market’s EGX 30 index concluded a 1,000-point rise over the past seven weeks with a 1.1 percent gain on the last day before the presidential elections, taking place today and tomorrow. <a href="http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/3/12/101995/Business/Economy/Egypt-stocks-closed-up-the-week-ahead-of-the-presi.aspx" target="_blank">According to Cairo’s Ahram Online</a>, investors were buoyed by candidate Abdel Fattah al-Sisi’s 94.5 percent approval rate by the country’s early overseas voters.</p>
<p>Also in the run up to the elections, Egypt’s first initial public offering since 2010 — of materials producer Arabian Cement — resulted in proportionally huge demand as the $110 million offering of close to 25 million shares was subscribed nearly 18.5 times, according to a disclosure note on the Egyptian bourse. Market participants and IPO facilitators widely expect that the country is going to see more IPOs despite observations that the outlook for the Egyptian economy is far from solid.</p>
<p>These scenarios contrast interestingly with another big election event that played out between May 22 and 25. Observers of European markets said that investors there seem to have directed their attention not on the voting for the European Parliament but more on the mood at the European Central Bank — even as the political air was loaded with concerns that extremists were taking big share of the vote.</p>
<p>The calm of the developed European markets in face of the continent-wide elections might make the irreverent observer wonder if the Lebanese are onto something when it comes to the importance of elections to stock markets. This is simply because the Beirut Stock Exchange remained in total calm in week 21 and index movements expressed not a trace of panic even as it became clear that Lebanon’s presidential elections were failing for the umpteenth time and would leave the country with a crucial vacancy at the top.</p>
<p>On the other hand, a panic would of course have been a sign of life.</p>

The bank then does an automated check before it gives its authorization, which is sent down in reverse order until it reaches the merchant and cardholder. The entire process takes approximately 2–3 seconds.</p>
<p>While the technical dimension is quite complex, from a merchant perspective either the payment goes through, or it doesn’t. Unfortunately for Lebanese merchants, the local payment gateways have a high refusal rate on foreign cards. Karim Saikali, a veteran of Lebanese e-commerce who founded <a href="http://buylebanese.com/" target="_blank">BuyLebanese.com</a> explains that many American banks will routinely block transactions that are done on a Middle Eastern payment gateway for “security reasons.”</p>
<p>Such blocking is a huge hindrance to Lebanese online businesses who depend greatly on international sales. With <a href="http://www.executive-magazine.com/business-finance/business/paypal-coming-lebanon" target="_blank">PayPal reneging on its promise</a> to come to Lebanon, local businesses have had to make do with alternatives to the largest and most trusted payment gateway globally. PayPal is widely cited among Lebanese entrepreneurs to be a better functioning, faster online payment system than the alternatives. Many merchants have opted for a combination of both smaller foreign gateways and local gateways. However, neither of these perfectly fits their needs.</p>
<p><strong>Good enough for Lebanon</strong></p>
<p>For Lebanese companies which exclusively do business inside Lebanon, local payment gateways such as Bank Audi’s E-payment gateway and Netcommerce, supported by Crédit Libanais and Fransabank, are not bad options. The local payment gateways have merits in terms of proximity, convenience and merchant support, as well as avoiding the fees that would be incurred on money transfers from a foreign bank account. Fadi Sabbagha, CEO of new media design and consultancy company <a href="http://www.borninteractive.com/" target="_blank">Born Interactive</a> says he always encourages his customers who only do business in Lebanon to use a local payment gateway. Unfortunately, Lebanese online businesses that only sell inside the country are quite rare due to the slow adoption of e-commerce among the Lebanese population.</p>
<p>These payment gateways have other drawbacks. Lebanese entrepreneurs have complained that the Lebanese payment gateways are cursed with long setup times. In Lebanon, to be able to sell through the payment gateways requires a lengthy approval process from the banks. “As a merchant, to start being able to accept cards is not an overnight thing. You need to get approval first,” says Sabbagha. According to Piotr Yordanov, founder of social network organizer Beepl, setting up online payment is a large time and resource commitment, as a company would “have to spend a whole week having a full-time CTO working on it.” Half-jokingly, he adds, “I even considered [virtual currency] Bitcoin” as an alternative, where the setup would only take a couple of hours.</p>
<p><strong>Crowdfunding</strong></p>
<p>In addition, Lebanese payment gateways are not specialized to cater to every business need. With the multitude of businesses possible through the online realm, some are too unconventional for Lebanese payment gateways’ expertise. Abdallah Absi, founder of online crowdfunding platform <a href="https://www.zoomaal.com/" target="_blank">Zoomaal</a>, was forced to resort to a US payment gateway when he first realized that local payment gateways had no experience in carrying out the due diligence on third parties to verify the credibility of those raising funds. “They didn’t know what kind of process needs to be put in place, and neither did we,” he says.</p>
<p>Foreign payment gateways, however, are not a perfect solution, and fail to meet the specific needs of Lebanese businesses. Zoomaal faced obstacles with these gateways’ reluctance to deploy the money raised for certain projects in Lebanon even after Zoomaal had already raised the funds. “And we want these kind of projects,” says Absi. Now that they are armed with the know-how to do due diligence themselves, they are incorporating a Lebanese payment gateway into their system, in addition to several foreign ones they will continue to use. “We hope they will give us that freedom,” he says.</p>
<p>The use of multiple payment gateways provides a temporary fix to Lebanese merchants. But until a payment gateway that targets their technical and specific needs presents itself, Lebanese entrepreneurs will continue to spend time and money disproportionately trying to figure out a service that many businesses around the world take for granted.</p>

By happenstance, the Swiss business school IMD released its annual <a href="http://www.executive-magazine.com/economics-policy/competitive-economies-imd" target="_blank">World Competitiveness Yearbook</a> (WCY) the following day, providing an ad hoc opportunity for a comparison across two fundamentally different rankings: happiness and competitiveness.</p>
<p>The PEI’s headline finding was that a majority of adults worldwide are experiencing positive emotions despite the fact that conflicts and unrest dominate much of the news. And while the results from 138 countries show, according to Gallup, that higher incomes contribute to people’s positive emotions, the researchers said that this correlation weakens above certain income levels, such as $75,000 per year in the United States. One would thus expect the PEI to roughly line up with the WCY, which is <a href="http://www.imd.org/news/2014-World-Competitiveness.cfm" target="_blank">dominated by rich nations</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.executive-magazine.com/economics-policy/competitive-economies-imd" target="_blank"><em>Related article: IMD’s competitiveness index ranks the nations</em></a></p>
<p>And this happened in certain cases: some countries ranked rather high for their positive emotions as well as their competitiveness. Examples include Denmark, the UAE, Canada and Austria. Several Eastern European, central Asian and African countries — but also Egypt and Lebanon — ranked in the lower 20 percent for positive feelings (Lebanon placed 126 of 138 countries) but the majority of these apparent nations-of-malcontents were not included in the WCY’s 60 economies.</p>
<p>But most notably, quite a few countries showed up at the opposing ends of the scales for positive emotions and economic competitiveness. Venezuela — dead last in competitiveness — was tied with El Salvador and Honduras for the ninth-highest ranking in positive emotions, while Luxembourg, one of the consistent high performers on competitiveness, was alongside South Korea — deep in the lowest third of countries when measured for positive emotions.</p>
<p>If anything, the never-ending race for competitiveness and the equally persistent search for places with the happiest vibes appear to have much room for convergence. One fact, however, emerged as more than clear from the Gallup survey. In case anyone would have had doubts, a civil war is the fastest way to devastate your nation’s emotions. Between 2008 and 2011, Syria ranked at around 60 points. By 2013, it was at 36 points, 16 points below any other nation and at “an all-time low for any country Gallup has measured.”</p>

From May 14 to 18, the pier played host to the ninth edition of Beirut Boat 2014, an annual nautical exhibition organized by <a href="http://www.ifpexpo.com/" target="_blank">International Fairs and Promotions</a> in collaboration with German trade fair organizers <a href="http://www.messe-duesseldorf.com/" target="_blank">Messe Düsseldorf</a>.</p>
<p>The event typically gathers boating enthusiasts and potential buyers with global producers of yachts and boats as well as agents of marine sports equipment and accessories. While the 2013 edition of the show was cancelled due to logistical complications, the organizers decided to go through with this year’s program to help maintain the continuity of the event, according to Beirut Boat 2014’s project manager Rayane Imad. They also “got many calls from producers and agents asking for the return of the boat show,” claims Imad.</p>

<p>With the change of location from Marina Joseph Khoury in Dbayeh to the Port of Beirut, closer to the city’s center and hospitality hub, the organizers were hoping to attract a large number of visitors this year. But they projected a maximum of 25,000 attendees, down from the 28,000 visitors at the 2012 edition, according to the festival’s <a href="http://www.beirutboat.com/pdf/Beirut%20Boat_2013_554.pdf" target="_blank">2012 post-show report</a>.</p>
<p>While the 2014 post-show report is not out yet, attendees Executive spoke to felt that this year’s edition was a smaller scale and less glamorous version of the previous exhibitions, despite it being in Beirut proper. Still, the return of Beirut Boat in any form could be taken as a vote of confidence for Lebanon’s hospitality and tourism industry.</p>

<p>Lately, the country’s music festivals have had many challenges to resist, yet, much like Lebanon itself, they are taking the hits but managing to hang on year after year.</p>
<p>The unpredictable security situation in the country creates its own obstacles for the various festivals. Last summer, <a href="http://www.baalbeck.org.lb/index.php/en/" target="_blank">Baalbeck International Festival</a> had to relocate to Jdeidet el Metn because of safety concerns in the Bekaa area: “We had the choice to either cancel the festival or to relocate to symbolically keep Baalbeck Festival’s name alive, so we chose to relocate,” says Nayla de Freige, president of the festival’s committee. This year, with the security plan already in implementation throughout the country, de Freige is planning to <a href="http://www.executive-magazine.com/society/baalbeck-festival-to-return-home" target="_blank">return the festival to its home</a>.</p>
<p></p><div><div><a href="http://www.executive-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/FEST_byblos.jpg"><img alt="Klaus Meine, lead vocalist of the rock band Scorpions at the 2013 Byblos music festival" src="http://www.executive-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/FEST_byblos-230x130.jpg" width="230" height="130"></a><span>AFP PHOTO/JOSEPH EID</span></div><p>Klaus Meine, lead vocalist of the rock band Scorpions at the 2013 Byblos music festival AFPPHOTO/JOSEPH EID</p></div><strong>Singing through security woes</strong>
<p>Security issues also make it harder to attract performers to Lebanon, and the country’s major international festivals have had to rely on their historic reputation and proven track record to convince artists to sign contracts.</p>
<p>Naji Baz, Byblos Festival’s manager, says he sells the name of <a href="http://www.byblosfestival.org/" target="_blank">Byblos Festival</a> which, after thirteen solid years of performances, has become well known among international artists’ managers, and attracts new talent. “I’d say our former artists are our best ambassadors, and of course we rely on that, but I feel that despite the very good reputation of Byblos abroad, we have to start from scratch every year,” says Baz, adding that it was as hard as ever to sign this year’s lineup since foreign artists don’t distinguish between areas in Lebanon and tend to deem the whole country as unsafe if they hear of an incident.</p>
<p>De Freige says some artists refuse to come to Lebanon while others dream of performing among the historical temples of Baalbeck which, throughout the sixty years of the festival, has hosted such talent as Umm Kulthum, Ella Fitzgerald and Fairuz. “We choose those artists who trust us and know we have a sense of responsibility so if we choose to be there, it is safe. It is usually easier to deal with Europeans because they know more about the reality of the country,” says de Freige.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.albustanfestival.com/" target="_blank">Al Bustan Festival</a>’s organizer, Nada Massoud, also admits that it is difficult to attract international talent to a country with security issues, but says that once artists get here, they are often pleasantly surprised, “fall in love with the country and some consider settling here.” She adds that the name of their artistic director, Gianluca Marciano, is very helpful in attracting classical music performers.</p>
<p>This has led some festivals to rely on domestic talent with Beiteddine Festival to open with Majida Al Roumi. “We try to give as many chances to young Lebanese talents as we can with at least one mainstream Lebanese program and one or two edgy ones as well,” says Baz.</p>
<p><strong>Budgeting for tough times</strong></p>
<p>Though all organizers Executive spoke to agree that the festival attendees are mainly Lebanese, the lack of a solid touristic season for the past three years has caused a decrease in the number of expats returning home for the summer and in the purchasing power of resident Lebanese. This has left many festivals struggling to maintain their standards and budget — which is largely from ticket sales — while keeping fair ticket prices.</p>
<p>Baz explains that artists’ fees have gone through a global inflation with the decline of CD sales and artists’ reliance on concert tours for their income. “This inflation has made it tougher to practice reasonable selling prices for your tickets especially since you want to remain close to the means of the Lebanese middle class,” says Baz.</p>
<div><p>Artists’ fees have gone through a global inflation with the decline of CD sales</p>
</div>
<p>Chahine agrees with Baz and adds that since the festival is attended mainly by Lebanese, they offer a wide range of prices to suit most purchasing powers in the country. Beiteddine Festival also offers affordable transportation to Beiteddine and free parking.</p>
<p>The festival organizers Executive spoke to derive between 60 to 80 percent of their budget from ticket sales, with some, such as Beiteddine and Baalbeck, receiving financial government support through the Ministry of Tourism. This support, explains Chahine, is often two years late forcing the organizers to take loans from banks in order to pay their dues on time. According to de Freige, 33 percent of the Baalbeck festival’s budget is spent on taxes which include the value added tax (VAT), and a tax on each international artist contract they sign. This, along with the delay in government support, makes planning in advance and attracting renowned talent hard. De Freige joins Al Bustan’s Massoud in asking that those taxes be reduced. “It’s true we are receiving government support but still we ask for the taxes to be reduced. We want the festival to be financially sustainable,” he says.</p>
<p>Chahine warns of a new law which would increase the VAT tax by 2 percent and the international talent tax by 10 percent in order to fund the Lebanese Artists Fund. “As private nonprofit organizations, we are not supposed to be responsible for this fund,” says Chahine who fears that, should this law pass, ticket prices would need to be increased to a level many people would not be able to afford, adding that they are working to stop this law from passing.</p>
<p>With these obstacles in their path, one might wonder why the festival organizers still give their time year after year. All the organizers Executive spoke to see it as their civic duty to the area they are in and for Lebanon as a whole. They are proud of the close relationships they have with the municipalities of the areas the festivals are held in and the support they receive from the residents who volunteer their time.</p>
<p>Baz sums it up: “We care that the festival takes place in Lebanon though it is very tough. Every market has its difficulties but at least abroad you can predict them and work with them but here there is nothing you can do to save yourself if the situation goes bad. It’s an act of hope.”</p>

<p> </p>
<p><b>Could you briefly describe the highlights and major events of HORECA 2014?</b></p>
<p>It was a beautiful show! We had a bit fewer exhibitors than we did last year — around 335 in total — but in the same size space so it was more spread out and comfortable.</p>
<p>We had more events and competitions this year though, with 19 competition categories at the Hospitality Salon Culinaire including the Live Lebanese Sweets, Live Pastry and the Junior Chef competitions for the students of the culinary and hospitality universities in Lebanon.</p>
<p>There were some new additions to the competitions this year such as the Lebanese Barista Competition, the Best Burger Competition (which is a rising trend in hospitality in Lebanon) and a competition among the chefs from the Lebanese Army sporting clubs.</p>
<p>Another new event this year was the Wineries Day in collaboration with the <a href="http://www.lebanonwines.com/" target="_blank">Union Vinicole du Liban</a>. We invited wine journalists and writers to blind taste wine from all the local wineries that were exhibiting and to give their feedback and opinion. The objective here was not to reward the wineries but to educate visitors and experts on Lebanese wines.</p>
<p>This year, the theme for the Lebanese Food Industries National Day, an annual full program for professionals in the industry organized by the <a href="http://www.slfi.org.lb/" target="_blank">Syndicate of Lebanese Food Industries</a>, was around innovation and creativity because of its importance in moving forward. The industry had a very good year in terms of exporting to other countries</p>
<p>We also had the Industry Lounge this year in collaboration with <a href="http://www.elcim-lb.org/" target="_blank">ELCIM</a> (Euro-Lebanese Center for Industrial Modernization) and other organizations that held a series of short presentations relevant to the sector.</p>
<p>Aside from these major events, we had the usual book signings and the Chairmania Design Event, which gave Lebanese designers the opportunity to share their latest chair design creations with hospitality professionals.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>What was the response and feedback you got from the visitors? How would you describe the mood in HORECA this yea</b><b>r?</b></p>
<p>This is what I am happy about. We have been holding our breath this past year not knowing what outcome to expect. The feedback was absolutely fabulous because the visitors also did not know what to expect.</p>
<p>Everybody in the hospitality sector was toiling away in their own isolated corner for this past year operating in a pure survival mode and at HORECA people met! They saw each other, and they interacted, and when you do that and you network, something positive is bound to occur.</p>
<p>This is the magic that came from this HORECA specifically: there was such positive energy and vibes as people went out of their way to communicate with each other. The thank you’s we received on the visitors’ feedback form this year were more than ever.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>To your knowledge, did any of the exhibitors at HORECA sell this year?</b></p>
<p>No exhibitor will give you straight figures on this but quite a few exhibitors told me they had sold out their stock.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Hospitality Services currently organizes three other HORECAs in the region: in Saudi Arabia, in Kuwait and now in Jordan. How would you compare the four?</b></p>
<p>HORECA Beirut has another flavor! It is the biggest by far and the most attended.</p>
<p>Hospitality is naturally in our blood in Lebanon. In the region, we are the capital of good taste, food and gastronomy.</p>
<p>It is fair to say we are the leaders in this industry, taking everything into consideration. We have more than 45 hospitality schools, university programs and technical degrees in Lebanon, more than in any Arab country.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Looking back at the past two years in Lebanon, how would you evaluate the performance of the hospitality and tourism sector?</b></p>
<p>We cannot deny that it has been a tough two years for the industry and it is has been severely hit. But the Lebanese are strong and have been through similar situations in the past. If you think about it, we have more bad years than good years overall and so we are used to operating in this environment.</p>
<p>Still it is not easy: The F&B industry has been badly hit and so have the hotels; though I cannot give you names [of hotels] some are going to close down this summer. It is truly a time when you either swim and stay afloat or drown.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>What are some of the coping strategies those in the hospitality business can adopt to stay afloat?</b></p>
<p>There are techniques to survive this critical period: you have to minimize your costs and expenses, and <a href="http://www.executive-magazine.com/society/tourism-exporting-lebanese-nightlife" target="_blank">also export concepts abroad</a>.</p>
<p>You see more and more people in the industry going into franchises abroad now, mostly to Dubai. Maybe it is a good opportunity because ultimately things will calm down here and they can continue to grow their business locally while also having established themselves in another market.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>How do you foresee summer 2014 in Lebanon?</b></p>
<p>There is a glimmer of hope in summer 2014. The new Minister of Tourism is working with enthusiasm and has adopted a plan that would make a difference.</p>
<p>We only need security, nothing else. The country is well loved in the region and tourists will return as soon as they sense stability. Also, there are many initiatives such as the one recently organized by the Traders Association in Saudi Arabia which highlights willingness to be open and receptive.</p>
<p>It seems there is an agreement to provide us with some stability to be able to breathe, so let us take advantage of that and do the best we can within this framework we are in.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>What are some of the trends in hospitality in Lebanon this year?</b></p>
<p>We are working on promoting local tourism through the Travel Lebanon show where we encourage Lebanese to explore the country: our country needs us and we need to travel around it. In Lebanon Traveller, Hospitality Service’s latest magazine, we are promoting rural tourism.</p>
<p>There are a million things we can do in Lebanon, from hikes to culinary and wine tours to art events, but we are not used to that and usually venture out of Beirut only for Sunday lunches, though we should explore different activities. We took our international judges on a street food trip and to Burj Hammoud which they loved! At the recent “Museums at Night” event, there was a cue outside the National Museum. There are many things happening but you need to hear about them.</p>
<p>Though this [local tourism] will not make up for the lack of international tourists, let us build on it at least and promote our domestic tourism among each other, especially since it appeals to expats.</p>
<p>We have to save ourselves hand in hand as no one will do it for us.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>What are the latest trends in the F&B sector?</b></p>
<p>This was a good year for street food, snacking and burgers. There is a global trend towards going back to one’s roots and traditions that has made its way to Lebanon, and so you find more Lebanese restaurants in heritage homes.</p>
<p>People are also looking for authenticity in their food and you can feel this. Again, we have to lobby for it and get more people involved in rural tourism because there are beautiful projects to be discovered.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Any final words?</b></p>
<p>This year was harder than last year for all the industry. We are part of the industry and feel their pain, and we felt that this year we made a difference: we put double the effort but it was part of our commitment to our industry and they felt it — and this was the magic we needed.</p>

As the number of <a href="http://www.executive-magazine.com/economics-policy/tourism-the-ghosts-of-seasons-yet-to-come" target="_blank">tourists visiting the country has steadily declined</a>, down 8.7 percent in January and 17.8 percent in February compared to the first two months of 2013, companies in the sector are running out of cash.</p>
<p>“The definition of good has changed,” laments Ziad Kamel, treasurer of the Syndicate of Owners of Restaurants, Cafés, Night-Clubs and Pastries in Lebanon and owner of Couqley’s and Gemmayze’s Alleyway. “Good used to mean you’re doing an acceptable margin, you’re paying out dividends regularly and you’re making money from your business. Today, good means you’re not in the red.”</p>
<p><strong>Running out of cash</strong></p>
<p>Different businesses have been put under different financial pressures by the Syrian crisis. In the domain of high-end hotels, businesses face slightly less pressure if they are owned by groups who can afford to continue injecting funds in them, at least until Lebanon’s tourism sector recovers from the crisis. Those who own the real estate can usually continue running and investing in the hotel without resorting to loans.</p>
<p>Two such cases are the Hilton Beirut Habtoor Grand Hotel and the Hilton Beirut Metropolitan Palace in Sin Al Fil, both owned by prominent United Arab Emirates businessman Khalaf al Habtoor, chairman of the UAE-based Al Habtoor Group, which also owns several Dubai hotels. While the two Lebanese properties are able to cover operational costs from their revenues, the investments to bring the two hotels fully up to the Hilton international brand standard are coming out of the pocket of the owner, according to Cluster General Manager Naif Zureikat who is tasked with keeping the hotel at those standards. “It’s a loan-free hotel,” he says.</p>
<p>On the other extreme, some hotels that aren’t operational yet have outright stopped investments. According to Pierre Achkar, head of the Lebanese Hotel Owners’ Association, some investments in hotels have been put on hold. One new investment, a Grand Hyatt project, <a href="http://www.dailystar.com.lb/Business/Lebanon/2013/Jan-21/203062-stalled-construction-plans-signal-negative-outlook-in-hospitality-sector.ashx#axzz31U5i4Sjs" target="_blank">was stopped</a> to wait for better days.</p>
<p>For many of the remaining hotels in Lebanon that are still operating, but have bigger financial constraints, getting investment is difficult. According to Achkar, it is nearly impossible under these circumstances to find investors ready to buy shares, since their return would be close to zero or negative. In an attempt to find a way to sustain investment through these times, the Lebanese Hotel Owners’ Association has lobbied the government to pass a law making it possible to sell a room or restaurant within a hotel along the model of a “condo hotel,” the profits from which could go back into the business.</p>
<p>On the side of ticketing and tour operators, cash flows have remained stable with the exception of those businesses geared toward incoming tourism, according to Jean Abboud, president of the Association of Travel and Tourist Agents in Lebanon. However, the affected businesses are small, are not faced with repaying loans and could deal with their waning income by downsizing.</p>
<p>Companies in the food and beverage industry have had their cash flows affected adversely, making it difficult to repay loans. According to Khater Abi Habib, chairman of the loan guarantee program for small and medium enterprises <a href="http://www.kafalat.com.lb/" target="_blank">Kafalat</a>, there has been a rise in the number of failed loans in the past two years, which, though the numbers are still unaudited, has increased to over 3 percent in the past six months compared with its rate of 1.8 percent in 2011.</p>
<p>The high rate of failure in the industry, exacerbated by the Syrian crisis, has diminished the tourism sector’s drive to take out new loans to finance growth. In the first three months of 2014, Kafalat loans to the tourism sector reached $1.8 million, a 64.5 percent decrease from $5.1 million in the first three months of 2013.</p>
<p>Kafalat has also witnessed an increase in the number of rescheduled loans from their portfolio. Though Abi Habib estimates it is no more than 2 percent, he points out that it is rising. “And I expect it will keep on rising for the next little while,” he adds.</p>
<p><strong>Banks and bankruptcies</strong></p>
<p>For those companies that have taken out loans to finance their businesses, negotiating loans with banks has become part and parcel of the process of running — and closing — a business.</p>
<p>Banks almost universally require personal guarantees from the owners when they are applying for a business loan. “It’s difficult in Lebanon to get a new loan if you don’t own something else to cover it. In the States, if you have idea you can get a loan. Here, you need a personal guarantee,” says Achkar.</p>
<p>For this reason, shareholders of failed businesses often find themselves repaying the loan for years after their company has shut down. Kamel refers to one of his less successful experiences when he and his co-shareholders decided to shut down one of their failing businesses. In 2012, they closed a restaurant that was opened January of that year in Zaitunay Bay. “We opened in January 2012, then [Gulf countries] put the [travel] ban in May. Overnight our revenues decreased by 70 percent. Ever since then, we had a loss every single month,” he says. They were able to renegotiate the terms of the loan, and the shareholders are still personally paying it off.</p>
<p>By having loans guaranteed by personal assets, banks minimize the chance of defaults on loans. Banks will rarely push their clients into bankruptcy, opting rather for negotiations with their clients as they shut down their business. Their supposed lenience comes with a perk: by rescheduling loans, they make some gains on the additional interest that accrues from prolonging the repayment period.</p>
<p>Moreover, in Lebanon the owners of the business cannot file for bankruptcy themselves, according to Elya Haber, managing partner at Haber and Partners Law Firm. And in the unlikely event that their creditors initiate the bankruptcy, the owners of the business would not have a clean state like in the United States. Having a bankruptcy to their name, they would be blocked from many future business transactions such as taking out loans. “To tell the truth, the system of bankruptcy in Lebanon is helping people not go into bankruptcy,” says Haber. Indeed, this system encourages owners of failing businesses to quietly close shop and personally repay the loan.</p>
<p><strong>Re-scheduling loans</strong></p>
<p>Living up to its reputation as an active player in the industry, Banque du Liban (BDL), Lebanon’s central bank, is creating measures to help businesses ride out the storm with a modification to a 2001 circular that would let companies reschedule their loans with banks for an extra three to five years.</p>
<p>Last September, BDL passed an intermediate circular amending Basic Circular 80 that subsidized interest on loans to the tourism, agriculture, industry, crafts and technology sectors. This amendment made it possible for banks to reschedule subsidized loans approved by BDL prior to September 2013, for a total of 10 years. The move was designed to alleviate the financial burden on companies until Lebanon reached more economically prosperous times, according to the BDL’s legal department.</p>
<p>Though the time has been extended, the subsidy itself has not been increased, so a company would have to pay the extra interest that will have accrued from extending the time to pay back the loan. The subsidized loan has a minimum amount of LL50 million ($33,000) and maximum amount of LL15 billion ($10 million) or 20 percent of the bank’s capital, with some exceptions if a single economic group invests in different sectors, according to the legal department at BDL.</p>
<p>This is not the first time BDL has issued amendments to weather a storm. Following the 2006 war, the central bank facilitated one-year loans to the tourism industry, which they could even use to cover operational expenses for that limited duration of time. The amendment to reschedule loans is a slightly less drastic move. According to Achkar, there are efforts currently by the Federation of Tourism Associations to lobby the government and BDL to extend operational loans to companies in the tourism industry, which would help with the cash flow of the day-to-day operations. However, this type of loan would be risky to implement if the Syrian conflict and Lebanon’s low prospects for tourism drag on for a long period of time.</p>

Pixabay | Geoff Gill"><p>As conditions for the hospitality sector in Lebanon remain stagnant, more and more entrepreneurs in the field are exporting their concepts to greener pastures abroad. While successful restaurant concepts have been expanding to the Gulf and Europe for the past decade, mostly serving the Lebanese community there, these past few years have seen nightlife venues also make this growth.</p>
<p>Dubai, with <a href="http://expo2020dubai.ae/en/" target="_blank">Expo 2020</a> looming in the horizon, over 60 hotels in the pipeline for the next two years and a substantial Lebanese working community, is the natural choice for these enterprises. Expansion to the Gulf is also the perfect strategy as it provides complementary seasons, being more active in winter while Lebanon’s traditional peak season is summer.</p>
<p>Executive sat down with the founders of two of the main enterprises leading the Lebanese nightlife growth in Dubai.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.executive-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/ADDMIND_white_Begelart-007_10.01.jpg"><img title="Add Mind's famed White venue in Dora" alt="Add Mind's famed White venue in Dora" src="http://www.executive-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/ADDMIND_white_Begelart-007_10.01-640x360.jpg" width="528" height="297"></a> Add Mind’s famed White venue in Dora</p>
<p><strong>WHITE – IRIS </strong></p>
<p>The past three years in Lebanon saw <a href="http://add-mind.com/" target="_blank">Add Mind</a> move their famed club White to Dora’s seaside road, allowing them more freedom and space to attract international DJs, as well as larger crowds. During that time, they also opened Caprice, an outdoor lounge style venue in Antelias, which Karim Jaber, managing partner at Add Mind, says was a “big hit” featuring two theme nights — French Night and Bazaar Night — that always draw in large crowds.</p>
<p>“Basically whenever you do a good outdoor concept in a good location with the right PR, people and music, it will work,” says Jaber, adding that this year Add Mind will be focusing on attracting more international talent to their clubs in Beirut.</p>
<p>Jaber is hoping many expats will return to Beirut this summer, which in turn, will encourage the tourists from the Gulf to come visit. “We now work in Beirut on weekends but we need it to be like three years ago when we were working seven days a week and were full,” says Jaber.</p>
<p>Add Mind’s plans for this summer in Lebanon are to open all their outdoor venues and beach clubs — such as Iris Beach and Bonita Bay — with their team from Dubai on location, in an attempt to bring an international flair to the staff in Lebanon. They will also possibly be operating a beach club in Beirut.</p>
<p>Long term plans for the company in the country also include a new concept next year, part of a new hospitality development in Antelias, which will feature many venues in one park-like space. After this, Jaber says there will be no further expansions in Lebanon as the company has enough venues in the country and their focus in on Dubai, especially in the winter season.</p>
<p>According to Jaber, Add Mind has been planning to invest in Dubai for the past five years, wanting a leg-up in what they see as a booming city. “Dubai is close to Lebanon and we have good PR since we know the Lebanese community there well,” says Jaber.</p>
<p>When Add Mind opened their first venue MAD in Abu Dhabi back in the year 2000, Jaber says it was a bit more difficult to operate than it is now that they’ve built a name for themselves in the country. Last year, Add Mind opened Iris Yas Island, Abu Dhabi, three days before the Formula 1 races took place there, and it did wonders according to Jaber. Though Iris Yas Island is still performing well on weekends and theme nights, Jaber sees Abu Dhabi as a completely different market to Dubai when it comes to nightlife as there are more tourists there and more Lebanese who want to go out.</p>
<p>In Dubai, Add Mind started two years ago with the White Room, a ballroom they transformed into a club on a weekly basis, and then moved White to Midan Hotel when the outdoor season started. Iris Dubai, on the 27th floor of Oberoi Hotel overlooking Burj Khalifa, followed a year later and is full seven days a week.</p>
<p>Add Mind’s name recognition from Beirut made them an immediate success with Dubai residents of Arab origin in general, and the Lebanese community specifically, who were used to partying in their Beirut venues. Since White was one of the first outdoor clubs in Dubai, it attracted a multinational crowd though its main clients remain Arabs. “It’s full every weekend and the people waiting at the doors from 11 to 3 are more than the people inside,” says Jaber. White Dubai is even larger than White Lebanon. While Iris, with its loungy appeal, also attracts a multinational crowd during the week, on weekends it mainly caters to Egyptians and Lebanese.</p>
<p>The team plans to open a few more venues in Dubai in the years to come. “The good thing about Dubai is that as much as you see it booming now, there are a lot of concepts that aren’t there yet and have room [to grow],” says Jaber, adding that they are considering different bar concepts such as cozy small bars which Dubai lacks at this time.</p>
<p>Jaber says there is still room for concepts by Lebanese in Dubai, as the Lebanese understand each other and know how to cater to their community. “Lebanese still go for different concepts but, in the end, they want to be where the other Lebanese are and so end up at Lebanese owned venues,” says Jaber. The main difference in operation between Dubai and Lebanon is that Dubai is more regulated, with rules such as closing times and capacity limits. “This is good because it gives you structure and there are no unexpected surprises or problems in that aspect such as is in Lebanon,” says Jaber.</p>
<p>The challenge for Add Mind now, according to Jaber, is to maintain their level of success. “We have to come up with new ideas and ways to maintain our clients because competition is high,” says Jaber, giving the example of five other outdoor venues opening a few months after they opened Iris.</p>
<p>Add Mind is considering other areas in the region for expansion such as Egypt or Morocco but their focus is remaining on Dubai which they believe is the best place to be at the moment.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.executive-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/music-hall1.jpg"><img title="Music Hall's live shows are now in Beirut and Dubai" alt="Music Hall's live shows are now in Beirut and Dubai" src="http://www.executive-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/music-hall1-640x360.jpg" width="528" height="297"></a> Music Hall’s live shows are now in Beirut and Dubai</p>
<p><strong>MUSIC HALL </strong></p>
<p>Michel Elefteriades, founder of <a href="http://www.themusichall.com/" target="_blank">Music Hall</a>, maintains that the situation in Lebanon is not as drastic for the leaders in the hospitality industry as it is for non-professionals in the field. “They used to have 500 hundred on the waiting list, they now have a hundred but they are still full.”</p>
<p>The outdoor Music Hall opened last year, a year considered to be slow for hospitality in the country, and was full to capacity with an extensive waiting list that caused Elefteriades to expand the venue this year to maximize on profits during the short summer season.</p>
<p>“Every good businessman has a plan to grow and expand his business,” says Elefteriades, adding that Lebanon has room for only one Music Hall and so it was natural that he exports the concept, especially since there is a demand for it. “I know that it can do very well abroad. Some concepts do very well in a certain country but may not perform as well in a different country — either because they are culture specific or because they rely on the great location they have in one country — but not Music Hall,” says Elefteriades.</p>
<p>Elefteriades says Dubai was planned for 2008 but was put on hold due to the economic crisis that hit the country back then. It was, according to Elefteriades, chosen as the first location for an exported Music Hall because it is the only country that has a good nightlife and is worthy of investment in the Arab world, aside from Lebanon.</p>
<p>However, Lebanese expats only make up 10 percent of Music Hall’s clients in Dubai, and Elefteriades says this is not a coincidence. “For the shows, I take into consideration the ambiance of the country I am in. I always have one Lebanese performer in my line up but, in the end, I am not opening a place for the Lebanese community but more of a cosmopolitan place. Even in Lebanon, the international community makes up 20 percent of clients every night,” says Elefteriades.</p>
<p>Elefteriades says he finds operations in Lebanon easier because he has a good reputation and a well-known name in the country, but in Dubai this is unfortunately not the case, making things a little harder. For Elefteriades the strength of Music Hall is a well-disciplined, well-crafted show with a strong build up and solid performances. A well-experienced team is also a must for Music Hall. “What I do when I open a new Music Hall is I only use the same people who were working in other Music Halls for a year. Those who were in the management team during the Dubai opening were in Beirut’s Music Hall for years and so have our culture and knowhow, and our approach to things,” he says.</p>
<p>He advises Lebanese thinking of expanding their operations to Dubai to have a good concept that is performing well in Lebanon before they take this step. “When you have a solid concept it will work anywhere but those who do not have a good concept in Lebanon from the start should not consider expansion in a different country.”</p>
<p>Elefteriades believes that Music Hall could do very well in many places and says he has been approached for franchises in many countries, as far off as Brazil, but he is not interested in franchising his concept at this point.</p>
<p>He was offered a location in Egypt but says that he hasn’t given his answer yet as he is looking more towards Europe and considering locations in Berlin and Paris. Music Hall will be opening in London within the year and Elefteriades says that although Europe is known for its live music, these countries do not have the line up of artists with different backgrounds and cultures, nor the build up and development that Music Hall is known for.</p>

Even harder to imagine is that this calm, residential neighborhood is expected to regain this status within the next year and a half.</p>
<p>But Lebanon’s F&B sector is notorious for its application of the economy of proximity with investors rushing in to new areas as soon as one venture succeeds and Badaro is no exception. Already, there are eight new venues that are said to have signed contracts in the area and are expected to begin operations within the next year.</p>
<p></p><div><div><a href="http://www.executive-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/GR36842-e1399578976848.jpg"><img alt="View from Smallville's rooftop pool, in Badaro" src="http://www.executive-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/GR36842-e1399578976848-300x147.jpg" width="300" height="147"></a><span><a href="http://www.executive-magazine.com/author/greg-demarque">Greg Demarque</a> | Executive</span></div><p>View from Smallville’s rooftop pool, in Badaro</p></div>Old time residents of Badaro enthusiastically speak of its past vibrant nightlife recalling such names as the Manhattan Pub Restaurant, which relocated to Broumana during the civil war; L’Orientale restaurant with the famed First nightclub in its basement; and Badaro Inn, which was the first venue in the area to serve snack food back in the day.
<p>With the onset of the civil war — and with Badaro’s location in the center of the crossfire — this once vibrant hub was transformed into a ghost town as many of the area’s residents fled their homes and hospitality venues slowly shut down as they lost their customers.</p>
<p>According to George, a Badaro resident since 1964, those who remained in the area after the war were the elderly. The few venues that were still in operation were only half full with residents and students of the neighboring schools during the day and deserted at night.</p>
<p>Yet Badaro, with its wide roads, comparatively good infrastructure and central location is regaining its appeal for developers and investors alike. Sami Hochar of <a href="http://www.catertainmentsal.com/" target="_blank">Catertainment</a>, the management company which owns Lina’s Cafe in Lebanon, says there are two new residential buildings on Badaro Street with a few more under construction as the older residents move to less busy areas or smaller houses and the buildings they inhabited are renovated or sold. “Within three to four years, Badaro will be a buzzing residential community,” says Hochar.</p>
<p></p><div><div><a href="http://www.executive-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/GR36815.jpg"><img alt="The Smallville, one of the first new businesses to open in Badaro" src="http://www.executive-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/GR36815-230x130.jpg" width="230" height="130"></a><span><a href="http://www.executive-magazine.com/author/greg-demarque">Greg Demarque</a> | Executive</span></div><p>The Smallville, one of the first new businesses to open in Badaro</p></div>Commercially, Badaro is in a central location close to the Palace of Justice which makes it a popular spot for law offices. There is also the Military Hospital, numerous medium sized enterprises, schools and universities in the area. Last summer, in a testimony to Badaro’s potential as a business center, <a href="http://thesmallville.com/" target="_blank">The Smallville</a>, a medium sized boutique hotel, became the first such project to open in the neighborhood.
<p><strong>Kissproof</strong></p>
<p>All these attributes were noted by Micky Abou Merhy and the rest of the team behind Vyvyan’s and Happy Prince — two successful hospitality venues in Mar Mikhael. Having been among the first pioneers to venture into Hamra and Mar Mikhael afterwards, they decided to open Kissproof, a café/bar concept in Badaro, despite the area still being relatively empty. Officially opened in early January 2014, Kissproof has so far had a larger turnover during the evening than during the day.</p>
<p>Yet, Abou Merhy and his partner in Kissproof, Yves El Khoury, admit that Badaro is still a difficult area to operate in as people are not used to heading there in the evenings. “Badaro is still a ghost town at night and people still perceive it as being far, so we had to double our efforts here and offer a unique concept to attract our customers,” says Khoury.</p>
<p></p><div><div><a href="http://www.executive-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/GR36783.jpg"><img alt="Setting in for the evening at Kissproof" src="http://www.executive-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/GR36783-230x130.jpg" width="230" height="130"></a><span><a href="http://www.executive-magazine.com/author/greg-demarque">Greg Demarque</a> | Executive</span></div><p>Setting in for the evening at Kissproof</p></div>Kissproof appeals to both day and night customers as it offers some of the best coffee in the city as well as the widest selection of draft beer. Their food menu includes special order charcuterie menu featuring Spanish ham, homemade pickles and toasted bread sandwiches.
<p>Noticeably calmer during the day, Abou Merhy says they are not placing high hopes on the daytime clients yet as he believes there is still not a culture of eating out on lunch breaks here, unless it is a plat du jour. “We hope this will change soon as we will all benefit,” says Abou Merhy.</p>
<p>This risk is offset by the benefits of the publicity received by being one of the first ventures in an area should it take off. Also, of course, there is the benefit of low rents and Abou Merhy says that rent prices for similar sized venues to his in Badaro are now almost quadruple what he pays. Low rents are an important factor in the longevity of a hospitality venue, especially with the fickleness of the Lebanese who go out.</p>
<p><strong>Lina’s</strong></p>
<p>Hochar says Lina’s sees the potential in Badaro and will be opening a 400 square meter branch in the location that formerly housed the famed Badaro Inn within the next three months.</p>
<p>Recently opened in Rabieh, and soon to launch in Gefinor Center in Clemenceau, Hochar says Lina’s has adopted the strategy of opening Lina’s in residential urban areas with little or no cafes, such as Badaro, in an effort to attract the residents and neighboring businesses.</p>
<p>“Badaro is my generation; it had the best stores for sports gear and music and I always wondered why it died since it is in a central location. But, little by little, we noticed there is activity in the area and we got the call that Badaro Inn is on the table,” says Hochar, adding that just the idea of being in the same place as Badaro Inn will be enough of a pull for people from his generation to come to the new Lina’s.</p>
<p></p><div><div><a href="http://www.executive-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/GR36883.jpg"><img alt="Lina's is set to open a new branch in Badaro" src="http://www.executive-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/GR36883-230x130.jpg" width="230" height="130"></a><span><a href="http://www.executive-magazine.com/author/greg-demarque">Greg Demarque</a> | Executive</span></div><p>Lina’s is set to open a new branch in Badaro</p></div>Hochar says Lina’s Badaro will be more accommodating of Badaro’s culture, and will have a restaurant-like layout and hot food menu which will include a plat du jour: “Badaro was borne for the daily dish,” says Hochar, speaking of many employees and residents who favor this food.
<p>Lina’s will still have sandwiches and coffee on the menu, which is the core of their business, but Hochar hopes the hot plate additions will attract families for Sunday lunches.</p>
<p>“The pub people rushed in because the trendsetters came to Badaro and many places have been rented out already,” says Hochar adding that he sees a vibrant, if controlled, nightlife in the area. “So far, we are focusing on the day but we believe it will slowly pick up at night.”</p>
<p>Abou Merhy generally welcomes these new ventures saying that some good players are investing in the area and will bring some needed healthy competition, ultimately directing more traffic to the neighborhood. Yet, he is apprehensive that some will invest in the area in the hopes of feeding off other’s successes and will end up ruining the ambiance for the more serious operators with unprofessional behavior.</p>
<p>Being a highly residential area, Badaro could face a similar situation to Gemmayze where the residents took to the street in protest over the loud noise and traffic in their neighborhood. Already, residents such as George are watching the hospitality developments with wary eyes: on the one hand, happy to see their neighborhood revived, but on the other fearing the disruptions that valet services and other disturbances, such as loud revellers and incessant music, might bring. “Residents in the new buildings here paid around a million dollars for their apartments and will not be happy to have their quiet homes disrupted by traffic and noise,” says Abou Merhy adding that Kissproof respects this and doesn’t play any music on their terrace.</p>

<p>Hochar sees a bright future for Badaro with more small, niche venues than loud bars and pubs such as the ones in Mar Mikhael or Gemmayze. His belief in the area also stems from the support he has received from the Badaro Traders Association which he says is very active and aggressive in promoting Badaro. “When you have many people working together for the success of something, it is bound to make it,” says Hochar.</p>
<p>For Badaro’s sake, we hope it’s true.</p>

Flickr|betsyweber"><p><em>Executive’s</em> On topic<em> column is a series covering startup concepts; bringing the field’s buzzwords to a broader audience and getting into the nitty gritty for those already familiar with the terms. As increasing activity and success stories begin to surface in Lebanon’s startup ecosystem, Executive sees this as an opportune time to bring these ideas to the business-savvy mainstream and anyone interested in following the sector’s development.</em></p>
<p>The lean startup method of product development is based on cutting out extraneous elements when building a product and testing it fast to adapt quickly to consumer reactions. It was proposed by Eric Ries, a coder, Silicon Valley entrepreneur and avid blogger, who first ventured the idea in a <a href="http://www.startuplessonslearned.com/2008/09/lean-startup.html" target="_blank">2008 blog post</a> and expanded it in his 2011 book titled “The Lean Startup”. The idea has roots in lean manufacturing, particularly in Japanese auto manufacturing company Toyota’s production system whose philosophy and management practices rely on eliminating expenditures that do not add value to the customer. The lean startup concept has been adopted by entrepreneurs worldwide and has become a best practice in startup ecosystems.</p>
<p><b>The pivot</b></p>
<p>Ries noticed that successful startups had something in common: they were all able to <b>pivot</b> quickly. Pivoting is what entrepreneurs do when they realize that their product isn’t receiving the traction they anticipated, and so they change directions, using what they learned to adapt and improve. Ries observed that startups that were successful know how to pivot fast. The idea is to learn and to pivot as quickly as possible between versions of the product so as to maximize a startup’s possibility of success before it runs out of money, turning the question from “How much money do I have to burn?” to “How much time do I have left to pivot?” It’s about starting fast, failing fast, and ultimately succeeding without expending a lot of resources.</p>
<p><b>Feedback loop</b></p>
<p>From his experience working in Silicon Valley, Ries noticed that a lot of entrepreneurs launched highly developed products that required major time commitments and lots of money only to find out that no one was interested in their product – something that happened with one of his own companies, <a href="http://www.imvu.com/landing_page/page/bubbles/?affid=cd6&subid1=GOOGA07C20&imvu_creative=22287163348&imvu_placement=&imvu_keyword=imvu&imvu_target=" target="_blank">IMVU</a>,a 3D avatar instant messaging company created in 2004 when everyone thought instant messaging (IM) was the next big thing. To try to prevent this from happening, he proposes the<b> feedback loop</b>, a cycle of building, measuring, and learning which is done as quickly and with as few resources as possible. This cycle enables entrepreneurs to see if their product gains traction and whether their hypothesis and strategies are grounded in reality, allowing them to modify their product if they fail to meet their objectives and to not waste years developing a product that adds no value for customers.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.executive-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/buildmeasurelearn.jpg"><img alt="buildmeasurelearn" src="http://www.executive-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/buildmeasurelearn.jpg" width="384" height="272"></a></p>
<p>For Ries, the critical aspect of the feedback loop is <b>validated learning </b>This is the process of learning and discovery about customer behavior by iterating versions of the product as quickly as possible. Because entrepreneurship is about creating something new in conditions of high uncertainty, no one knows exactly what customers want. The whole process should be geared toward learning what catches on with customers and what doesn’t. The unit of progress shifts from building on schedule to the amount of validated learning derived from the various iterations because even a prototype of a product that the founders consider likely to fail may not fail for the same reasons they initially thought it would.</p>
<p><b>Minimum viable product</b></p>
<p>Shifting the focus to validated learning means that startups only need to develop a basic version of their product for the purpose of testing through various iterations. This <b>minimum viable product</b> should be built in a way that provides only what is necessary to learn whether their plan is correct or not, and cut out all extraneous elements. By establishing how customers are behaving, they can incrementally experiment with the product to see how they can improve their metrics to hit their ideal. If they are unable to reach their ideal, it’s time to pivot.</p>
<p>The minimum viable product begs the question of what really needs to be in the first version, if they only need to build to test a hypothesis and the only real goal is validated learning. In a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEvKo90qBns" target="_blank">2011 talk</a>, Ries refers to his days as chief technical officer of IMVU. After having worked on the first version of the product for six months and after having written about 25,000 lines of code himself, customers refused to download the application. The product was flawed because it was based on false assumptions about its customers. Though the company pivoted and eventually created a successful IM network, they still threw out those six months worth of code and Ries laments that he could have been on a beach for all of that time and it wouldn’t have made a difference to the company. Time and energy could have been saved and the learning process could have been sped up had they, for instance, created a simple landing page with a download link to see if anyone would click on it.</p>
<p><b>The lean revolution</b></p>
<p>The ideas embodied in “The Lean Startup” have turned into a movement of people who want to change the way entrepreneurship is done. Because entrepreneurship is everywhere – not just limited to startups – and by Ries’ definition includes anyone who is working under conditions of extreme uncertainty, many lean startup methods can be applied to large companies to transform them from old dinosaur companies with steady revenues from a tested source of value to operations that are constantly creating new sources of value for the customer. Effective leadership can create a platform for the team to innovate, which is a break from the twentieth century management practices of planning and forecasting designed for companies whose metrics don’t change much from year to year.</p>

While this may remain a topic of heated debate, we cannot ignore the increasing voices calling for a return to a slower and more natural way of life.</p>
<p>Globally, the World Health Organization’s (WHO) <a href="http://apps.who.int/iris/handle/10665/92455" target="_blank">Traditional Medicine Strategy 2014-2023</a> sees that traditional and complementary medicine (TCM) is growing, as more and more countries are including aspects of it in their national healthcare plans. WHO sees its goals as twofold: to support member states in harnessing the potential contribution of TCM to health and wellness, and to promote its safe and effective use through regulation.</p>
<p>Lebanon has always been receptive to the more holistic approaches to healthcare, but the focus was usually more on the local and traditional ones — involving herbal remedies or folk wisdom shared by the elderly.</p>
<div><p>In the past three years alone there has been a significant rise in the number of wellness centers offering meditation and yoga sessions</p>
</div>
<p>In recent years, Lebanon has also joined the West in embracing the traditions and alternative practices originating in the East. In the past three years alone there has been a significant rise in the number of wellness centers offering meditation and yoga sessions, along with courses on homeopathy and Reiki healing.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.eddesands.com/" target="_blank">Edde Sands Resorts</a> has recently begun organizing two Wellness Week sessions per year, which focus on healthy eating, meditation and yoga, as well as courses on alternative medicine. Another sign that interest in alternative healthcare has spread in the country is Zenotel, a boutique hotel project by the Gemmayel sisters set to open in May, which will be the first traditional medicine platform in the country combining different approaches under one roof. The sisters hope it will be an alternative healthcare center in the long run.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether one sees these options as an elaborate scam to make money or has an open mind and is willing to learn about different practices, Executive went on a hunt to discover what options are available in Lebanon.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Traditional Chinese Medicine</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.executive-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/alternative-medecine2.jpg"><img alt="alternative-medecine2" src="http://www.executive-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/alternative-medecine2.jpg" width="559" height="373"></a></p>
<p>Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) is a 5,000 year old form of natural medicine derived from Taoism. It has four aspects: acupuncture, herbal medicines, Qigong energy healing and Tui na massage (a form of Chinese manipulative therapy, often used in conjunction with acupuncture). Each aspect can stand on its own or in conjunction with the others, depending on the specific case.</p>
<p>Acupuncture is defined as “a form of ancient Chinese medicine in which fine needles are inserted into the skin at certain points in the body,” and has become widely practiced globally. It is now recognized by the WHO and TCM herbs have recently been gaining the approval of the US Food and Drug Administration.</p>
<p>There are 30,000 acupuncturists in Britain alone with TCM syndicates or associations in many European countries. Acupuncture in these countries is covered by insurance, though it is still met with opposition from those who believe that there is not enough research to prove its effectiveness, believing it might be a placebo.</p>
<p>Acupuncture is used mainly for the treatment of chronic cases such as aches or digestive problems. “Acupuncture can be used for acute diseases as well, so long as it is not an emergency or an operation is needed,” explains <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/edmond-ibrahim/36/852/913" target="_blank">Edmond Ibrahim</a>, founder of the Chinese Medical Center in Lebanon and a trained doctor of Chinese medicine. The number of sessions needed for effective acupuncture treatment varies but no less than ten sessions are recommended for the patient to benefit, explains Rasmig Azezian, a physiotherapist and representative of the Pranic Healing Middle East and Africa Association (PHMEA) in Lebanon — who also has a diploma to practice acupuncture. A session with Azezian costs $40.</p>
<p>In Lebanon, acupuncture is the most practiced aspect of TCM, since herbal medicine requires a lot of paperwork from the Ministry of Health due to prior incidents that gave Chinese herbal medicine a bad name. In 2011, the health ministry revoked the license of Zain al-Atat’s herbal medicine manufacturing company after a series of scandals. “Here we insist that if a doctor is not certified and trained in Chinese medicine, he has no right to prescribe Chinese herbal medicine as it should be prescribed according to the TCM method,” explains Ibrahim.</p>
<div><p>“We insist that if a doctor is not certified and trained in Chinese medicine, he has no right to prescribe Chinese herbal medicine.”</p>
</div>
<p>Acupuncture is prevalent in Lebanon and Ibrahim explains that while there are only three doctors  — himself included — in the country who have completed eight years of Chinese medical schools and are therefore fully trained and certified, there are many other conventional medicine doctors who have taken acupuncture courses and have a diploma in the practice which they use to compliment their main practice. He estimates that this number is close to 100.</p>
<p>In fact, <a href="http://www.sju.edu/" target="_blank">St. Joseph University</a> (USJ) has been offering a 150-hour university diploma program in acupuncture for its medical and physiotherapy students since 2010. This is in collaboration with the Confucius Institute, a joint institute between Shenyang Normal University and USJ, which helps them bring doctors from China to Lebanon. Although this program was not offered this year due to security issues in the country that prevented Chinese professors from coming to Lebanon, the physiotherapy department says demand for courses was high and they regularly had more than 25 students enrolled.</p>
<p>The Lebanese University Medical School and the Antonine University are also interested in establishing ICM studies in their faculties — a sign that the Ministry of Education in Lebanon acknowledges acupuncture — but Ibrahim says there are regulations and procedures that need to be followed to be affiliated with a quality Chinese university.</p>
<p>While Ibrahim encourages this merging of acupuncture and conventional practices, he warns against doctors using it outside their professional expertise, which could lead to malpractice and a tarnished reputation for acupuncture in the country. “This diploma should be used to aid practitioners in their main major of choice. So, for example, physiotherapists should only use acupuncture to treat physical pains, not fertility or digestive issues, or a gynecologist can use it to treat polycystic ovaries.”</p>
<p>The number of patients who have had acupuncture in Lebanon is growing and Azezian, a physiotherapist, says more than 50 percent of his patients come to him for it. Ibrahim keeps a full schedule of patients who come to him for TCM and says that some have already tried the procedure abroad while others are looking for a more natural approach to their healthcare.</p>
<p>As acupuncture is spreading in Lebanon, it becomes even more important to have government regulation. “We ask that the Lebanese government helps us form an association or syndicate for TCM practitioners in Lebanon. This will encourage more control and patients will know which practitioners to trust,” says Ibrahim, adding that there should be coordination among professional Chinese doctors and conventional medical practitioners in Lebanon as they complement each other.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Energy Healing</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.executive-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/alternative-medecine1.jpg"><img alt="alternative-medecine1" src="http://www.executive-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/alternative-medecine1.jpg" width="580" height="386"></a></p>
<p>All energy healing is based on the belief that there is magnetic energy flowing all around us and through us at the same time, and that an energy healer can channel this energy and use it to clean the patient’s system, thereby enabling the system to self-heal.</p>
<p>Most well known is Reiki, a Japanese technique for stress reduction and relaxation, which also promotes healing. Gini Ghaziri, a Reiki master practicing in Lebanon, says the role of all energy healing is to try to bring mankind back to balance by finding the trauma in the body created by an external cause such as physical abuse. “It is about revitalizing your life force so that your body can heal itself.”</p>
<p>Ibrahim explains that while there are different styles of energy healing, they all have the ancient form of Qigong as a base, and he therefore insists one cannot call himself an energy healer master without having extensively studied Qigong for a number of years. “An eight hour course does not make you a master of a certain treatment; you have to study the meridians, acupuncture points, the body’s anatomy and diagnosis theory of Chinese medicine. With a course, you might learn a few exercises but you cannot be called a master or professor, this takes years of practice and training. It becomes more psychological, in a manner similar to meditation or yoga.”</p>
<p>While one can find Reiki masters and courses  in Lebanon, the most prevalent form of energy healing in the Middle East appears to be Pranic healing, defined as “a form of no-touch energy healing developed by Chao Kok Sui, a doctor of chemical engineering, which utilizes prana or life-force to balance, harmonize and transform the body’s energy process.” Azezian explains that because Chao Kok Sui had a background in science, he made every effort to simplify ancient philosophies and quantify their healing techniques, thereby bringing energy healing closer to the masses. “To make the alternative complementary, we have to be simple in order to reach more people. We aim to have one pranic healer per family,” says Azezian.</p>
<p>Pranic healing can be taught in eighteen hours, after which, claims Azezian, one can cure oneself of almost any chronic illness, making it an economical practice as well.  Azezian offers such courses, including a basic two day course for $200, in his Pranic Healing Institute center in Burj Hammoud. “This magnetic energy is already part of you but we need to train our skills in order to identify it and work with it,” he explains.</p>
<p>Azezian has a total of 100 students enrolled in his center and says there are around 150 Pranic healers in Lebanon. The Middle East headquarter of PHMEA is located in Dubai, and Azezian says there are around a 1,000 healers practicing it across the UAE. “They are much more open-minded and advanced than us there because the governor of Dubai made alternate medicine a priority.”</p>
<p>Azezian was working toward having a legal association for Pranic healing in Lebanon, but, due to the political situation in the country, he is now just focusing on spreading awareness and understanding. “It is going to grow because people are actively seeking different ways to help themselves,” he says.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Homeopathy</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.executive-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/alternative-medecine4.jpg"><img alt="alternative-medecine4" src="http://www.executive-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/alternative-medecine4.jpg" width="580" height="385"></a></p>
<p>Homeopathy was founded in 1796 by the German physician Samuel Hahnemann, and is a holistic form of medicine based on the principle of “like cures like,” or the idea that a substance taken in a diluted form will trigger the body’s natural system of healing and thus cure the same symptoms it caused when it was taken in its crude form.</p>
<p>Homeopaths believe each person is unique, reacts to symptoms differently and so should be prescribed medication specific to the individual case. “It is a very tailored and individualized approach. We often prescribe different medications to people who have the same problem because they react to those symptoms differently,” explains Wafa Abed El Samad, a dentist who has a diploma in homeopathy from the London International College of Homeopathy (LICH), which offers courses in Lebanon.</p>
<p>An initial diagnostic session can take around two hours, explains Yvonne Siblini — also a graduate of the LICH who cured herself from a thyroid problem after taking conventional treatments for four years — as the homeopath goes through the history of the person, including past traumatic experiences, medical history and what position the patient sleeps in.  “We scan the whole body through talking to the person and seeing how they respond to their symptoms,” explains Siblini.</p>
<p>The extensiveness and thoroughness of these sessions have led skeptics to say that homeopathy is no more than psychology with a placebo pill thrown in for good measure.</p>
<p>Reportedly used by the likes of Richard Branson and David Beckham, homeopathy has been growing in popularity over the past few years. Today, homeopathy has a strong presence in Europe and has been integrated into the healthcare systems of many countries including France, Germany and Switzerland, according to the British Homeopathic Association.</p>
<p>In total, $6.4 billion was spent on homeopathic and herbal remedies in the US in 2012, a 16 percent growth from 2007 according to Mintel, a global market research organization, which expects that figure to reach $7.5 billion in 2017 as availability of such medicines increases through mass retailers.</p>
<p>Homeopathy reached Lebanon in the year 2002 through a four-year part time course run in Lebanon by the LICH which lead to a diploma in homeopathy. Siblini and Samad were part of the second group who took the course in Beirut and estimate there is a total of 15 people practicing homeopathy in Lebanon.</p>
<p>Both practitioners agree there is a growing awareness regarding homeopathy among Lebanese, and attribute this to them being well travelled and therefore learning of homeopathy abroad and also to patients who have been successfully treated through this approach in Lebanon  spreading the word.</p>
<p>Siblini says she has been practicing homeopathy for five years and has witnessed a steady increase in patient numbers. Abed El Samad says homeopathy is complementary to her dentistry practice as she often gives homeopathic pills to patients instead of antibiotics or painkillers. She proudly recounts a severe gum abscess case which she was able to cure by homeopathy alone. “The more cases I treat with homeopathy, the more I bear the responsibility to show how safe and economic this choice I have made is,” she says.</p>
<p>Perhaps most indicative of the practice’s growth in the country is that, four years ago, USJ began offering an elective course in homeopathy to students enrolled in pharmacy, medicine or dentistry. The administration at the university says enrolment for this course has been steady since its introduction, reaching up to 40 students.  Homeopathy is touted as economical, and although homeopathy sessions in some countries can reach up to $800 per session — depending on the homeopath’s level of training — a typical two-hour diagnostic session in Lebanon will cost $75, with follow up sessions for $50. Following the diagnostic session, homeopathy continues to be economical in that medications are comparatively affordable and are taken for a short period of time — usually two or three times only — and few follow up sessions are typically needed.</p>
<p>Homeopathic medication has also risen in accessibility in Lebanon. Hotel Dieu Pharmacy, next to the Lebanese National Museum, manufactures low potencies of homeopathic medications, and say they sell an average of 50  prescriptions per month, usually for aches and pains. Mont Liban Pharmacy in the Furn El Shebek area provides such medications as well but imports them from Canada. Still, because homeopathy has no legal status in Lebanon, and is not regulated, not all homeopathic medications are available, and none is covered by insurance.</p>
<p>“Homeopathy is not recognized in Lebanon and is left up to the individual. We want to try to legalize our situation especially since it is being taught in USJ, and is prevalent in Europe,” says Abed El Samad. “The road is long and hard but I think we are moving in the right direction.”</p>

The PITME program organizes a jam-packed schedule for entrepreneurs to meet with mentors in Silicon Valley and receive training in diverse areas of their business. The co-founders of Presella got a free ride to the acceleration program as the second place winners of the Startup Demo at ArabNet Riyadh 2013. Having been immersed in the Valley’s vibrant tech culture and notoriously fast-paced atmosphere, they got a taste of life in the mother of   all startup ecosystems. Here are three things they loved that they would like to see happen in Lebanon:</p>
<div><em> </em></div>
<p><b>1.Speed networking</b>: “Everyone in Silicon Valley is a connector,” says Kadri. The pair attended many events where everyone was constantly introducing themselves to each other. The introductions are very short and simple: who they are, what they do, exchanging contacts and then on to the next person. The beauty of this type of networking is that even if there are no direct benefits to meeting someone, they will often talk to a potential resource later on and refer them to you. “I think this is how things get done so fast,” adds Kadri.</p>
<p><b>2.Constant pitching</b>: Kadri and Singer recall going to a “party” with a game of twister in one room and a pitching event in another. Making pitching an informal, regular part of life  for startup founders keeps everybody on their toes and gives them more opportunities to refine their idea. Though Presella was generally  well received, according to the pair, they also received a lot of constructive criticism from judges on the panels that helped them refine  their upcoming business plans.<a href="http://www.executive-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/IMG-20140416-WA0003.jpg"><img alt="Presella's Louay Kadri and Walid Singer" src="http://www.executive-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/IMG-20140416-WA0003.jpg" width="317" height="408"></a></p>
<p><b> 3.Hackathons</b>: Everywhere. The pair found that in Silicon Valley, hackathons were constantly under way. Hackathons are events  where coders (and sometimes non-coders) get together in small teams generally for the purpose of developing new software.  Hackathons have a reputation of generating highly innovative results in a short amount of time. “Here, we’re not pushing this enough,”  says Kadri.</p>

This would undoubtedly give insurance companies the chance to increase their market in compulsory motor insurance. At Q4 2013, turnover for motor was $338.7 million with compulsory insurance making up just $56 million, equivalent to16.5 percent, according to ACAL (Association des Compagnies d’Assurances au Liban)’s quarterly report. Total premiums for motor insurance made up the third largest market share in 2013 at 23.9 percent. The new law would increase the market share of compulsory motor insurance, but would also add an unknown amount of risk.</p>
<p>But compulsory motor insurance for TPL covering material damage, while enacted in law, has not been extended to practice. The implementation of the Traffic Law awaits a series of decrees from the Ministry of Economy and Trade for specifics in execution.</p>
<p>This sluggishness is caused by a cautionary approach that the relevant bodies have adopted in putting this law into effect, after a clumsy implementation of the first compulsory law for motor insurance in 2003 that covered TPL for bodily injury. The latter was plagued by many woes such as cash underwriting, which was met with few checks from the weak control of the Insurance Control Commission (ICC) and ultimately saw insurance companies unable to pay claims and going bankrupt. Cases of fraud and evasion that surfaced during implementation of the first law have also caused wariness among stakeholders in the execution of the second.</p>
<p>“We need to take our time to study how to introduce it,” says Walid Genadry, head of the ICC under the Ministry of Economy and Trade. “You can introduce it today, but we will have real problems.”<br>
The debacle of implementing compulsory insurance for  this kind of TPL has led the National Bureau for the Compulsory Insurance (NBCI), the body in charge of suggesting the policy’s pricing, coverage and conditions to the ministry, to tread gingerly in implementing the second, seeking the World Bank’s advice over the best practices in the sector. Lack of sectorial data further compounds the slow implementation of policies.</p>
<p><strong>Unethical players</strong></p>
<p>The implementation of the 2003 law saw many actors engaging in inappropriate behaviors to the detriment of both the insured and the industry. Cash flow underwriting became a way for insurance companies to attract a larger share of the market to generate investment capital by pricing premiums lower than the legal rate set by the NBCI. In many cases the price at which they sold premiums did not generate enough returns, and their inability to pay claims quickly, or at all, gave the industry a bad reputation. Many companies went under or lost their licenses due to cash underwriting. American Underwriting Group (AUG), for example, was writing this kind of business and went bankrupt from bodily injuries claims leaving some of their clients with nothing, laments Fateh Bekdache, vice Chairman and General Manager of AROPE Insurance and head of the NBCI.</p>
<p>The Insurance Control Commission (ICC) did not then, and still does not have, enough power to properly enforce compliance. “We still don’t have an insurance law that lets the [ICC] intervene quickly and effectively for stopping such behavior,” says Genadry. According to Bekdache, the law prescribes two extremes in types of penalties, but is missing many intermediate penalties which are the most important to deter disobedient behavior.</p>
<p>To deal with the issue of cash underwriting, the ICC proposed that reserves should be taken from each company based on their loss ratios, the difference between a company’s premium income and claims settled. In the event that they don’t have enough money to pay their claims, companies could use the fund, preventing them from non-payment of the claims. This could also increase the ICC’s control over insurance companies, forcing companies to increase their premiums in the event that they don’t have enough money to contribute to the fund.</p>
<p>Fraud is another serious concern for industry supervisors. Though there were substantial cases of fraud under the compulsory TPL for bodily injury law, it was investigated by the NBCI, and according to Bekdache has improved since the beginning of implementation of the 2003 law. “You can tell from the volume of vignettes that are sold every year.”  They were able to implement some control over falsifying papers, where some brokers were falsifying vignettes,” he says. The situation improved after the NBCI made it mandatory to get policies and vignettes directly from them.</p>
<p>According to Jamil Harb, secretary general of ACAL, fraud is even more common in the compulsory motor insurance industry for TPL in material damage. He cites the case of Jordan in which compulsory insurance in this sector was badly applied, resulting in many companies facing bankruptcies linked to fraud where companies were paying claims that didn’t exist. Fraud is a serious concern for insurance companies, particularly those that deal in compulsory insurance. “We are always worried about fraud,” says Naji Sultanem, general manager at Victoire Insurance Company. “When there is something obligatory, people most of the time think that because I paid it, I want to do something with it.”</p>
<p>Evasion could also put a weight on the industry. Bekdache estimates that 20-30 percent of cars are not insured for bodily injury, with a total of 1.3 million cars in Lebanon covered. When an uninsured car gets into an accident with an insured car, this places the burden on a single insurance company.</p>
<p><strong>Steering away from compulsory</strong></p>
<p>Despite some improvements since 2003, the experience of insurance companies with compulsory motor insurance for bodily injury has made some of these companies move away from this remit. Victoire’s Sultanem complains that the lack of consensus on the price of an indemnity to pay for someone who has lost their life to a car accident is a burden on the insurance company. He says that claims are often decided by lawyers and can range from as low as $5,000 to as high as $200,000.</p>
<p>The high cost of some claims, is what led Victoire to steer away from the compulsory motor business altogether. “In the past 15 months we have modified our strategy in the bodily injury,” he says. “Our target was to lower our bodily injury impact on the company.” Victoire is a small insurance company with a large share of its business in compulsory motor insurance. According to the ICC’s Insurance Sector Annual Report for 2012, Victoire had the third largest share of compulsory motor insurance with $3.4 million in gross written premiums. In addition to their $2.5 million in gross written premiums in non-compulsory motor insurance, motor insurance makes up almost half of the total $11 million for their non-life insurance premiums.</p>
<p><strong>Premium Pricing</strong></p>
<p>Setting a price for the new premium, a responsibility of the NBCI, is hindered by lack of sectoral data on profits and claims for each segment of motor insurance. While a central database was called for as early as 2003 that would collect data on the sector and historical claims on a car, it has not seen the light of day. Besides an NBCI initiative to bring insurance companies together to share data, the NBCI is still setting premium prices mostly in the dark. The NBCI is moving to collect sectoral data to help price the product. “This is one of the main points that we are trying to clarify now, in order to see what is the actual impact of TPL on the market. Based on that, you can define the price,” says Harb.</p>
<p>Currently, premiums for bodily injury are priced by tranche, depending on the type of vehicle, rather than on the risks calculated for each driver. The premium is made up of the technical premium and an additional percent that covers the broker’s commission, together ranging from $50 to $100. Like the premium for bodily injury, the premium for material damage is to be a flat fee.</p>
<p>Pricing the new premiums will be a challenge. There is some data available in the market regarding motor claims, but it is for total claims rather than product-specific claims. ACAL’s last Quarterly Report for 2013 pegs claims at $188.6 million year to date. However this data does not distinguish compulsory from other types of motor insurance. It lumps together compulsory, TPL for material damage, full motor coverage including self-inflicted damage, as well as total loss — products ranging widely in both premium prices and amount of claims.</p>
<p>What is known is only that material damage will likely involve more claims, based on the higher frequency of accidents that incur material damage in contrast with accidents incurring bodily injuries. “Insurers witness a 25 percent accident rate. If you take 1.3 million cars you are talking about over 300,000 accidents per year,” says Genadry. At Arope Insurance, Bekdache claims that they get 110-120 new claims every day in material damage, whereas accidents claims with bodily injury only surface once or twice per week. According to Harb, the claims ratio between compulsory and non-compulsory claims is one to 50.</p>
<p>Not all insurance companies, however, see the benefit in collecting data. “It’s expensive, you have to have a full-time job for someone just to input data,” says Victoire’s Sultanem. To effectively move insurance companies to compile the relevant data, the ICC would likely have to make this mandatory by law.</p>

The town, home to the most famous and stunning Roman ruins in the country, is located just a few kilometers from the Syrian border. As the Bekaa Valley region has become increasingly lawless and violent, with the civil war from neighboring Syria creeping into Lebanon, tourists have steered clear of the area.</p>
<p>Last summer <a href="https://www.facebook.com/BaalbeckInternationalFestival" target="_blank">Baalbeck International Festival</a> announced it was not going to be held in the city’s ancient ruins due to security concerns. This was the first time since it was relaunched in 1997 that it was forced to relocate.</p>
<p>Yet, in a decision that will be widely welcomed in Lebanon, the event organizers are now aiming to return to the city. “This year, we are planning to be in Baalbeck,” Nayla de Freige, president of Baalbeck International Festival’s executive committee, told Executive.</p>
<p>De Freige is hopeful that the newly launched <a href="http://www.dailystar.com.lb/News/Lebanon-News/2014/Apr-11/252995-three-detained-in-army-crackdown-in-bekaa.ashx" target="_blank">security plan</a> in the Bekaa will succeed, thus increasing confidence in the region and allowing the festival to have a successful return. “We are still three months away from the festival and Lebanon is a country of surprises. We want to believe positive things will happen during that time,” says de Freige.</p>
<p>The festival committee always coordinates with the internal security forces, the army and the Baalbeck municipality to have security presence on the roads leading to the temples, and this year will be no exception, De Friege said. <span> </span></p>
<p>Speaking of last year’s relocation, de Freige says they had planned to have the festival in Baalbeck as usual and even announced as such to the media. However, last summer’s deteriorating security situation in the Bekaa region left them with only two choices: cancel the festival or relocate.</p>
<p>Instead the festival was hosted at La Magnanerie, a renovated historical silk factory in Jdeidét el Metn. In an attempt to replicate the ambiance of Baalbeck, the stage’s backdrop was a large image of Baalbeck’s Bacchus Temple.</p>
<p>De Freige says this year’s program is already set and the festival will open in August, after the holy month of Ramadan. She would not reveal the names of any of the artists performing.</p>
<p>Baalbeck Festival has in previous years hosted such iconic artists as Ella Fitzgerald, Umm Kulthum and Fairuz.</p>

<p>Going to China for manufacturing “was a no-brainer,” according to Slaibi, who adds that the main reason he and co-founder Bassam Jalgha applied to Haxlr8r was to get a leg into China’s large manufacturing sector. “We went there because all the signs told us we should go there,” he says. He adds that China has the best manufacturing knowledge and the most efficient practices for a fraction of the price that it would cost elsewhere. “All the supply chain is already set, all the shipping is already set, and all the manufacturing. If you are upset with your factory, you just move to the next one. There is a lot of choice, a lot of competition, a lot of experience – it’s amazing.”</p>
<p>While Slaibi is once again based in Beirut, co-founder Bassam Jalgha stayed in China to oversee the manufacturing operations. The pair met though a band during their undergrad years at the American University of Beirut but didn’t start working together until 2012, several years after they had graduated. By that time Jalgha had developed a prototype of the device for which he <a href="http://www.aub.edu.lb/fea/fea_home/student_resources/Pages/stars_of_science.aspx" target="_blank">won the first place prize</a> of $300,000 in the 2009 Stars of Science Competition. When the pair decided that it made sense to collaborate, they spent a year and a half developing the technology, and in August 2013 entered Haxlr8r with nine other startups.</p>
<p><b>Iterating quickly</b></p>
<p>The Haxlr8r program was a fast ride. Slaibi explains that in the first week they learned about prototyping and manufacturing, and the electronic factory market next door. Equipped with funds from the accelerator of $25,000 they started to iterate quickly, first prototyping the printed circuit boards (PCBs) that are in Roadie, then the plastic mold. “Making a plastic cast is really an iterative project. You do one, and then you start refining it,” he says. “You can make as many 3D models and as many computer renderings. But if you don’t hold it and try it out on an actual guitar, you don’t get a feel of it.” According to Slaibi they made at least 50 prototypes that were tested on different guitars to find a design that worked with all pegs.</p>
<p>“It’s mind-blowing how quickly you can iterate [in China],” says Slaibi. “You can order a PCB, and two days later it’s mailed to your office. Same thing for prototypes; they had three different types of 3D printers, which helped iterate quickly.”</p>
<p>The low-cost of production and Chinese manufacturing expertise helped them design a better product. Because it’s cheaper, “instead of making one prototype, you can make five,” Slaibi says. “The end-result is much better.” Likewise, the experience and expertise of their manufacturing partners in China also contributed to the quality achieved in the final product, according to Slaibi. “Those guys are amazing. They would take a design and just add everything that’s related to plastic and make it more sturdy,” he says.</p>
<p>The Haxlr8r program opened their eyes to the business aspect of the product by exposing the team to different mentors. Slaibi explains that one mentor taught them to “gamify” the app – to engage users by creating game-like features – to make tuning more fun. Others taught them about marketing and branding. The mentors also gave them a broader vision. “Really a vision beyond just a guitar tuner, of a company that does music related products … that creates helpful tools for musicians,” says Slaibi.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><b>Raising 60k in four days</b></p>
<p>On the last day of the three and a half month acceleration process, the team launched a campaign on American crowdfunding platform giant Kickstarter to fund their first phase of manufacturing. In just four days, they raised their goal of $60,000. The full campaign raised $178,613, almost three times their goal.</p>
<p>Planning the campaign and figuring out a strategy to ensure its success took two full months of work, according to Slaibi. One of their strategies was to reach out to media outlets such as TechCrunch that specialize in technology and entrepreneurship.</p>
<p>The other was a small innovation of theirs: they developed a regular chromatic tuner that they launched three months before Kickstarter, which got 6,000 downloads by the time they launched the campaign, according to Slaibi. On the day of the launch, they had a simple splash screen featuring Roadie Tuner with the option to learn more. “Those 6,000 people who knew the app, and knew it works and believed that we can make the product, a lot of them went on and backed us in the first few days,” says Slaibi. Out of the 6,000 downloads, 80 of them became backers of their campaign, according to Slaibi.</p>
<p><b>Next steps</b></p>
<p>When asked about their capacity for production, Slaibi said that they could make as many tuners as they want, but their first batch will consist of 3,500, which they will be selling both online and through orders from distributors. They are hoping to get more distributors for the second batch, which according to Slaibi will come a few months after the first. The retail price for the tuner will be $99.</p>
<p>They currently have a partnership with a German distribution company for music products, Hyperactive Audiotechnik, whom they met through a long series of acquaintances. They have attended various trade shows around the world to introduce their product and make initial contacts with other distributors. “Whenever the time is right, we might do collaborations with big names,” says Slaibi. They are still waiting for bigger margins to make partnerships with big players. As the recent <a href="http://www.executive-magazine.com/business-finance/business/diwanee-a-startup-success-story" target="_blank">Diwanee acquisition</a> shows, making contacts at an early stage can be a crucial factor later on.</p>

<p>Where in Beirut would one find a decent cup of coffee, a glass of high quality French wine, a filling sandwich and an appetizing dessert all under one roof?</p>
<p>Though such eateries that combine different concepts can feel schizophrenic and tend to be lax in at least one aspect, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/cafediemrestaurant" target="_blank">Café Diem</a> manages to pull it off, making a smooth transition from breakfast through to dinner and drinks.</p>
<p>Sandwiched in-between Sodeco Square and Monot, Café Diem is ideally positioned for such a day/night concept and is frequented by Ashrafieh’s society ladies for coffee or breakfast, business folk on their lunch breaks and young couples in the neighborhood who are looking for a casual yet trendy evening.<span>  </span></p>
<p>The ambiance cleverly cultivated by the décor is warm and charming, a blend between a bistro and a wine bar with a heavy dose of coziness. The crisp square white tiles used on the walls, as well as the charcuterie slicing machinery and the crepe maker on display, makes one feel they are in a cozy kitchen while the black chairs and dark hardwood flooring contrast wonderfully with the walls and evoke the feel of a French bistro. <span> </span></p>
<div><div><a href="http://www.executive-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/salad1.jpg"><img alt="The salad is fresh and flavorful" src="http://www.executive-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/salad1.jpg" width="540" height="359"></a><span><a href="http://www.executive-magazine.com/author/greg-demarque">Greg Demarque</a> | Executive</span></div><p>The salad bar offers the best garden fresh assortment in town</p></div>
<p>Little details such as the tea boxes and wine crates artistically scattered around and the wine bottles displayed in glass cases across from the chrome espresso maker highlight the versatile atmosphere of the space. The open kitchen theme where you can see your food and coffee being prepared and the bar running alongside it add to the relaxed and casual feel.</p>
<p>Café Diem is owned by Donald Battal who brought us <a href="http://classicburgerjoint.com/" target="_blank">Classic Burger</a> and the same idea of simplicity coupled with good taste in the food menu is also found here. The offerings include an extensive breakfast menu with staples such as omelets and pancakes on offer. A scale up from Classic Burger, a business lunch (alcohol-free) for two would cost around $45.</p>
<p>Executive visited at lunchtime and arrived to find the place packed to the rafters. It is not a place for an intimate conversation. We were sitting so close to the next table that a moment of silence on our part ensured that we could hear every word of the conversation of the couple next to us.<span>  </span>But the crowd was reminiscent of the setting at a French café and did not at all deter from friendly and rapid service.</p>
<div><div><a href="http://www.executive-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/bus1.jpg"><img alt="The ambiance is relaxed" src="http://www.executive-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/bus1.jpg" width="580" height="386"></a><span><a href="http://www.executive-magazine.com/author/greg-demarque">Greg Demarque</a> | Executive</span></div><p>The seating invites diners to get to know the person next to them</p></div>
<p>I ordered the salad bar and tomato bruschetta for appetizers. The French bread the bruschetta was served on could have been less chewy but the tomato topping had just the right amount of basil and lemon seasoning.</p>
<p>The salad bar is the freshest I have seen in Lebanon in that even the asparagus and artichoke included were fresh and not canned. The bar also features original and authentically Lebanese items such as pickled eggplants and <i>labneh</i> balls of fresh goat cheese. The dressings were creative and included alongside the typical offerings, a ginger and soya dressing as well as a Mexican inspired sauce. <span> </span></p>
<p>For the main course we had a generous open faced chicken sandwich with a mayonnaise dressing that was surprisingly light and a grilled fish platter that was fresh tender, accented by simple olive oil garnish and sauté of fresh spinach that brought up the flavor of the fish wonderfully.</p>
<p>Everything was beautifully presented on dark grey stone slabs but the presentation of the espresso we ordered after lunch was a feat for the eyes of those who find beauty in simplicity. Also on a partitioned dark grey stone slab with a circular space for the dainty white cup, a light brown biscotto was diagonally laid on the remaining part of the slab and two small cubes of brown sugar were placed in parallel creating an artistic visual. The taste itself was strong, as espressos should be, and the biscotto was just sweet enough to take the edge off. <span> </span></p>
<p>We passed Café Diem later in the evening and it was almost as packed as it was at lunchtime but this time people were sipping on red wine instead of lattes.</p>
<p>With Café Diem, Battal has created a winning formula which is casual enough for it not to be a passing fad yet chic enough to maintain the interest of those who are attracted to fads.</p>
