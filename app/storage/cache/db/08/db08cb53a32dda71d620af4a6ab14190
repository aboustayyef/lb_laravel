Think of how big the country is! And yet, it would be equally ludicrous to suppose that the <a href="http://eatocracy.cnn.com/2013/05/24/top-10-burgers-around-the-country/" target="_blank">10 burgers I listed here last year are still the country’s best</a>. Every year new hamburger debutantes have their coming-out parties, and each year obscure starlets emerge from the hinterlands to enchant even the most effete of critics.</strong></p>
<p><img src="http://www.nogarlicnoonions.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/1.jpg" alt="pornburger" width="600" height="400"></p>
<p><a href="http://eatocracy.cnn.com/2014/05/30/best-burgers-2014" target="_blank">Here then is this year’s edition</a>. Not all are new; and not all are necessarily mind-blowing. A few, like Hildebrandt’s and Dyer’s, owe as much to their picturesque surroundings and rich history as they do to the salt and blood of their beef. But all 10 of these burgers deserve our attention, our respect, and most of all, our willingness to eat several of them, one after the other.</p>
<ol><li><strong><a href="http://www.harrysbarburger.com/" target="_blank">Harry’s Bar and Burger</a> - Providence, Rhode Island: </strong>Like New Haven’s Yankee Doodle or Meridien, Connecticut’s Ted’s, this obscure Providence burger bar transcends its humble New England roots, producing a blue-ribbon slider so classic that it might have passed across a lunch counter in 1927. Salty, brown and with nary a daikon to be found, this old-school classic was my favorite discovery of 2013.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://montmartrenyc.com/" target="_blank">Montmartre</a> - New York City: </strong>When Montmartre chef Michael Toscano told me that he wanted me to try a patty melt filled with béarnaise sauce and creamed spinach, my first impulse was to wince, and my second to run. I did wince; but I didn’t run. And I’m glad I didn’t. Generally, I find patty melts, essentially grilled cheese sandwiches with a burger patty in the middle, to be disturbing freaks, two fine sandwiches yoked into a unnatural union. Add in creamy, piquant béarnaise and creamed spinach, and the thing sounded like a recipe for horror. And instead it was great! All of the elements work together beautifully, and thing is lush and creamy and meaty and crusty all at the same time.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://aldenharlow.com/" target="_blank">Alden & Harlow</a> - Boston, Massachusetts: </strong>I’ve had Alden & Harlow’s Secret Burger only once, and that one was smuggled out for me without the chef knowing. Such is the reputation of this hamburger that I was afraid to get it in person. If, as I suspected, it was all hype I wouldn’t know it from the soigné product they put in front of me. But lo! The Secret Burger more than lived up to its reputation. None of the orthodox burger elements are omitted: the bun is squishy, the sauce Thousand Island-y, the lettuce and tomato dispensable, as always. I hated the dehydrated piece of Cabot cheddar, and almost left the thing off this list because of it. But there is no burger on this list that has more magnificent meat, a three-way Creekstone blend to which has been added some secret smoked element.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.hotelpalomar-dallas.com/dallas-restaurant/knife.html" target="_blank">Knife</a> - Dallas, Texas: </strong>It should surprise no one that John Tesar’s Ozersky Burger made this list; its creation was a shameless ploy for praise from a man he knew to be a hardened egomaniac. That said, the Ozersky Burger is fantastic. Seared, salty, squishy and with a pervasive perfume of soft onions, it takes a little bit of New Jersey into the Lone Star State. (Like Harry’s, the Ozersky Burger has a family affinity with White Castle.)</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://trifectapdx.com/" target="_blank">Trifecta</a> - Portland, Oregon: </strong>I should say here that I like everything at Trifecta. But of all the things this Portland newcomer has going for it, a double pimento burger is—to me—the best. Pimento cheese has a Southern connotation, but it’s sweet and artificial and phosphorescent, and so looks good on crusty brown patties oozing juice and fluid. The fries are good, too.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://whitehut.com/" target="_blank">White Hut</a> - Massachusetts: </strong>Speaking of White Castle: In the wake of the chain’s success, the country was inundated with knock-offs and clones—Blue Castles, White Towers, White Mannas, White Diamonds, Royal Castles and many more. (Others, like Krystal and Kewpie, took on other names.) White Hut belongs to this ancient tribe, and with three locations in central Massachusetts more than lives up to their low standards of flat, greasy, onion-y, and soft-as-gnocchi hamburgers. There is likely some old-time burger shack somewhere near your house that is like White Hut, only not as good.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.dyersonbeale.com/" target="_blank">Dyer’s Burgers</a> - Memphis, Tennessee: </strong>Sticking with the old school, Dyer’s deserves some credit here. The Memphis institution has one of the boldest and more revolting boasts in the business: It has been deep-frying hamburgers in the same dirty oil for more than 50 years. The bluesy, Beale Street setting adds much to the flavor, but it actually is a singular taste experience, because tallow, too, can carry a whiff of terroir.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://holeman-finch.com/" target="_blank">Holeman & Finch</a> - Atlanta, Georgia: </strong>My previous list praised Company Burger in Atlanta, and rightly so, but that burger was generated by Holeman & Finch, a classy cocktail bar whose food program is under the owlish gaze of the great chef Linton Hopkins of Restaurant Eugene. The burger, another double, departs from the old-school model in many ways—an in-house bun, artisanal ingredients—but it’s true to the spirit of the old burgers. Also it’s very good. Especially with a martini.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.hildebrandtsrestaurant.com/" target="_blank">Hildebrandt’s</a> - Williston Park, Long Island, NY: </strong>There is a wistful, elegiac note to this list; some of the places on it might not be here next year. They therefore deserve to be honored now. Hildebrandt’s is primarily a candy store and ice cream parlor, and it looks like someplace where Archie might have taken Veronica—to name two more defunct figures. A small grill is usually occupied with flat burgers made from meat delivered daily by a local butcher. If there is a more quintessential hometown hamburger, I am sure I can’t imagine what it could be.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://mileenddeli.com/" target="_blank">Mile End</a> - New York City: </strong>The Smoked Meat Burger at first perplexed me. I love pastrami, and I love hamburgers. But putting pastrami on a hamburger strikes me as a cheat. But in packing both beef and finely cut pastrami into the same burger and aggressively cooking it on hot iron, some happy synthesis of the two is created, and when dressed with thick pickles, it makes me happy to be living in strange times.</li>

<h2>Some Background</h2>
<p>I’m happy that most stories I’m covering these days on this blog are happy ones. This summer’s looking good, despite all the political nonsense happening. But hey, let the politicians fight like children over seats, while we try to carve out some good things to enjoy about living and loving in Lebanon.</p>
<p>Nightlife hotspots in Lebanon have had a cyclical pattern for almost two decades now. As kids, we’d go club on Monot Street, later on Gemmayzeh took on the nightlife hotspot title, followed by Hamra and now Mar Mikhael.</p>
<p>However, one thing we often overlook is that the areas don’t suddenly die, but instead transform into the type and variety of venues that proved most successful. One cannot deny Monot has seen busier days, but the selection of pubs and restaurants there are the ones that survived and still prosper today. Same thing with Gemmayzeh and Hamra: the best venues are still there and doing great. Let’s call it the natural selection of nocturnal activities in Lebanon.</p>
<p>Further proof that this cycle isn’t an absolute one? We all know about Batroun, Jbeil and Jounieh’s meteoric rise when it comes to the nightlife sector, albeit quite different than Beirut’s. Jounieh and Jbeil’s ancient souks are a gorgeous backdrop to have a drink or two at, and Batroun’s summer activities and venues are always bursting with revelers.</p>
<h2>Badaro’s Rise</h2>
<p>One new Beiruti area that has been quietly but surely rising to the top, is Badaro. With delightful venues like Kissproof always full, and a handful of others popping up on the Badaro main street, with many more being planned for, it’s definitely one of the up-and-coming spots in the city. What’s different about Badaro, compared to Mar Mikhael, is that it’s somewhat less haphazard and unorganized. Instead of a few dozen places mushrooming up in an area not prepared to absorb so many people, the local authorities and business owners in Badaro are somewhat wisely planning what they believe will be a big boost in afterhours business.</p>
<h2>The Possible Cherry on Top: Valet-Free Zone</h2>
<p><a href="http://ginosblog.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/3-Valet-Gemmayzeh_634498290318855431_mainimg.jpg"><img src="http://ginosblog.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/3-Valet-Gemmayzeh_634498290318855431_mainimg.jpg" alt="3-Valet-Gemmayzeh_634498290318855431_mainimg" width="480" height="320"></a><a href="http://www.dailystar.com.lb/News/Lebanon-News/2011/Aug-25/147107-growing-numbers-of-valets-seen-as-nuisance.ashx#axzz33UPme1SD"><em>Image courtesy of The Daily Star</em></a></p>
<p>Ample parking space is one thing, and more importantly, heavy resistance to valet parking mafias. We all hate the valets in Lebanon. They’re reckless drivers that occupy public property and charge exorbitant prices for subpar services you often have no choice of opting out of.</p>
<p>One business owner in Badaro insists he’s told off several valet parking companies already, trying to secure some business with his establishment. Of course, I was elated at this news.  Mar Mikhael’s fall into the clutches of valet means two things: traffic is choking because of their inconsiderate double and triple parking on public roads, as well as idly sitting by waiting for the car owners to show up and get their cars. It also means if you don’t want to pay 7,000LBP and trust a stranger with driving your car (good luck getting it back in one piece btw), you’ll have to do the impossible to find a parking spot to just go down have a drink and some fun.</p>
<p>That’s why I really really really hope the Badaro folks and merchants committee stick to their unofficial decision to keep the valet thugs off their streets. For me, not having valets there is an immediate dealmaker. I’d happily abandon Mar Mikhael or Uruguay if I knew I wouldn’t be hassled to pay or give up my keys to park on public property. Badaro also has plenty of parking lots, which I’m sure can be persuaded to open at night and absorb the rising numbers of people coming to the area for a drink or dinner.</p>
<p>As for the valet calamity everywhere else, the government should step in and clear these violations. Of course, we know that’s a bit farfetched, so, the least they can do is make sure the prices are fixed. A couple thousand liras should be more than enough, but any lira above 5,000 is just thievery. Also, put the cops to better use, and instead of preying on young people who look like they smoke pot, make sure the drug dealers and pimps disguised as valets keep the sides of the road like they should be: public property taxpayers pay to maintain as such. As for the venues employing valet services, I know you love the commissions you take from the profits the valets make, but remember, if the behavior remains this bad and outright illegal, we’ll just take our business elsewhere where parking and getting there isn’t a street battle with uniformed gangs.</p>
<h2>Places Already Open + Opening Soon</h2>
<p>I’ll be heading over there a lot over the next few weeks to review the places already open, and leak the places that are going to soon, so stay tuned!</p>";s:17:"post_image_height";i:665;s:16:"post_image_width";i:1000;s:11:"post_visits";i:14;s:18:"post_twitterShares";i:7;s:19:"post_facebookShares";i:288;s:16:"post_totalShares";i:295;s:16:"post_socialScore";i:37;s:13:"post_virality";i:45;s:9:"blog_name";s:11:"Gino's Blog";s:16:"blog_description";s:79:"Home of FASHAL, The Weekly Leaks, and everything you love and hate about Beirut";s:8:"blog_url";s:21:"http://ginosblog.com/";s:11:"blog_author";s:10:"Gino Raidy";s:28:"blog_author_twitter_username";s:9:"ginoraidy";s:13:"blog_rss_feed";s:26:"http://ginosblog.com/feed/";s:9:"blog_tags";s:7:"society";s:2:"id";i:45;s:11:"blog_active";i:1;s:24:"blog_last_post_timestamp";i:1401717540;}i:9;O:8:"stdClass":26:{s:7:"post_id";i:30564;s:8:"post_url";s:59:"http://tech-ticker.com/user-friendly-phone-headsets-office/";s:10:"post_title";s:52:"The most user friendly phone headsets for the office";s:10:"post_image";s:72:"http://i1.wp.com/tech-ticker.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/headset2.jpg";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:123:"Choosing the right headset for your office can make all the difference in your overall productivity.

It can also make things easier for you staff, resulting in less strain, fatigue and time off work. In simple terms, the more user friendly a headset is, the shorter the training period, and the faster your staff can get back to work. Here are some of the more user friendly headsets you can choose for your office today.</p>
<h3>Wireless headsets</h3>
<p>Without a doubt, wireless headsets are the optimal choice for those businesses and organisations serious about their overall communication systems. Cords just get in the way, and going wireless allows your staff to concentrate more on servicing your clients and getting their work done. Top of the range models such as those offered by <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/~com2.com.au/">Com2</a> include the Sennhieser DW Pro Series, the Jabra PRO 900 Series, and the Savi 720. All these models are completely wireless, comfortable, and have a long enough talk time to see most work days through. Of course, you need to ensure the range of the headset you purchase is suitable for your environment and working conditions. However in this day and age, most headsets offer more wireless range than needed in most office environments. But it doesn’t hurt to check.</p>
<h3>Noise cancelling headsets</h3>
<p>Another important feature in a user friendly headset is the degree of noise cancellation it provides. We all know that offices aren’t necessarily the quietest of environments. With other colleagues on the phone, incoming phone calls, and the constant churning of office printers and fax machines, you need a headset that shields as much outside noise as possible. Noise cancelling headsets block much of the outside noise from entering your earpiece, enabling you to listen more attentively to your clients. Some of the better models on the market today include the HW251N Noise Cancelling Monoaural headset, as well as the TriStar H81N Noise Cancelling Headset.</p>

<h3>Corded headsets</h3>
<p>If going wireless isn’t exactly your thing, or – more likely – you work in an environment with too much interference to allow for a clear signal to run through your office space, then you’ll have to settle for a corded headset. However, there’s no need to feel discouraged. In fact, corded headsets offer a number of advantages that you just can’t find in wireless models, and can end up being the most user friendly choice for your office. For example, corded models don’t run out of battery. If your sales process errs on the longer side, then a headset that won’t run out of battery during an important call can be worth its weight in gold. Both the Jabra BIZTM 1900 Series and the Jabra GN2000 Series of corded headsets are not only comfortable and made to last, but feature state of the art noise cancellation technology. How good is that?</p>

<p>Choosing the most user friendly headset for your offers depends on a number of factors: mainly your physical environment and your work culture. Luckily there are a number of high-quality headsets on the market today that can suit just about any office or application. So take your time, read the reviews and talk to other offices to find out which ones work the best. No doubt you’ll have chosen the best headset for your office in no time at all.</p>

<p>Think you may have what it takes to present Lebanon in the most beautiful image? Well, here is your chance. </p>
<p>Through the “<a href="http://lbcblogs.com/?feed-stats-url=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cueW91dHViZS5jb20vd2F0Y2g/dj1SSFd0Qy1GV25xUQ==" title='\"Green' your screen target='\"_blank\"'>Green Your Screen</a>” initiative, you can now boast your photography skills combined with your love for Lebanon’s nature by taking part in a competition that hopes to promote the country’s green heritage as well as bring people together for a good cause. </p>
<p>This competition, mainly sponsored by the Lebanese Ministry of Environment, Jarir Digital Printing Center and in collaboration with the Al-Shouf Cedar Reserve aims to engage the Lebanese public, pro and amateur photographers over the age of 15 to go out into the great outdoors and bring back their most prized visual masterpieces. </p>
<p><a href="http://lbcblogs.com/?feed-stats-url=aHR0cDovL2xiY2Jsb2dzLmNvbS93cC1jb250ZW50L3VwbG9hZHMvMjAxNC8wNi9MZWIuanBn"><img src="http://lbcblogs.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Leb-300x223.jpg" alt="Leb" width="300" height="223"></a></p>
<p>How to participate: </p>
<p>Log into this <a href="http://lbcblogs.com/www.greenyourscreen.com" title='\"website' target='\"_blank\"'>website</a> and fill out a form. (Alternatively, you may also check their <a href="http://lbcblogs.com/?feed-stats-url=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZmFjZWJvb2suY29tL0dyZWVuWW91clNjcmVlbj9mcmVmPXRz" title='\"Facebook' page target='\"_blank\"'>Facebook page</a>.) </p>
<p>More details on the rules and conditions are also found there.</p>
<p>Each participant must post five images. There is no entry fee to participate in the competition. The contest theme is “Take a picture of the nature of Lebanon”, and must be accompanied by a comment that describes the image in either Arabic or English. </p>
<p>There are five posts per profile, and only one profile is accepted.</p>
<p>Competition starts on July 1st and ends on August 1, 2014. </p>
<p>Judges include <a href="http://lbcblogs.com/?feed-stats-url=aHR0cDovL3d3dy5qcHRhcmFiYXkuY29tLyMhL2hvbWU=" title='\"Bernard' renno target='\"_blank\"'>Bernard Renno</a>, a Lebanese artists and cultural adviser, professional photographers <a href="http://lbcblogs.com/?feed-stats-url=aHR0cDovL3d3dy5qcHRhcmFiYXkuY29tLyMhL2hvbWU=" title='\"Jean' pierre tarabay target='\"_blank\"'>Jean Pierre Tarabay</a> and <a href="http://lbcblogs.com/?feed-stats-url=aHR0cDovL3d3dy5taWNoZWxlc3RhLmNvbS8=" title='\"Michel' esta. target='\"_blank\"'>Michel Esta</a></p>
<p>So what’s in it for you other than exposing your work to a high profile judging panel and gaining another incentive to escape into nature? </p>
<p>Prizes include cameras presented by Cannon, a one night stay at the Shouf Cedar Reserve with a cedar tree planted on behalf of the winner carrying his/her name. </p>
<p>Personally? I can’t think of a better way to engage people in a productive activity that would raise awareness on the beauty that surrounds us, a heritage we have come to take for granted. </p>
<p>Boxed inside apartment buildings and offices, we have lost tune with the rhythm of Mother Nature, Mother Gaia. </p>
<p>Lebanon, home to one of the most ancient cultures, became so for a reason, and the reason is its rare ecosystem that we are now destroying. </p>
<p>So go out, let’s shoot Lebanon, let’s shoot it using our cameras and not our guns since the latter has proven a failure over the course of many years. </p>
<p>Let us expose the beauty that surrounds lest we stand a chance at protecting it for future generations to come. </p>
<p>Here’s last year’s report. </p>

The internationally acclaimed tenor will be accompanied by the Budapest MAV Symphony Orchestra conducted by Maestro Christopher Franklin.</p>
<p>For the world’s leading opera houses, Juan Diego Flórez is very much the bel canto tenor of choice. His fluid, expressive singing and dazzling virtuosity make him ideal for the operas of Rossini, Donizetti and Bellini. His program at the Beiteddine Art Festival includes arias by the three famous composers. His operatic and recital appearances at the most prestigious venues in the world have earned him the acclaim of critics and audiences alike.</p>

<p>Since Burger Day was on May 28, I thought of sharing with you the list of burgers that I usually crave in Lebanon. The burgers were selected from restaurants, burger joints, diners and fast food chains that I’ve been to in the past years. </p>
<p><strong>1- The Butcher’s Cut at Brgrco</strong><br><img src="http://blogbaladi.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/WP_20140428_17_21_01_Pro.jpg" alt="WP_20140428_17_21_01_Pro" width="1024" height="576"></p>
<p>This 6 Oz Hussein Hadid signature burger is one of the best burgers I’ve had in Lebanon. I usually order it with mature English cheddar on top and cheese fries on the side. </p>
<p><strong>2- Gourmet Burger at Eau de Vie – Phoenicia Hotel</strong><br><img src="http://blogbaladi.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/20130921_222444.jpg" alt="20130921_222444" width="1024" height="576"></p>
<p>I wasn’t expecting to see a burger on Eau De Vie’s menu but their 50,000LL gourmet burger is quite amazing. </p>
<p><strong>3- The Cheeseburger at Happy Prince – Mar Mikhail</strong><br><img src="http://blogbaladi.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/20131029_201153.jpg" alt="20131029_201153" width="1024" height="576"></p>
<p>Happy Prince’s burger is a must-have and comes in limited quantities. Read my review [<a href="http://blogbaladi.com/the-happy-prince-mar-mikhael/">Here</a>].</p>
<p><strong>4- Swiss’N’Mushroom Burger at Classic Burger Joint</strong><br><img src="http://blogbaladi.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/image1.jpg" alt="image1" width="739" height="454"></p>
<p>Even though I find their burgers a bit bulky, the Swiss’N’Mushroom is a great burger and my favorite at CBJ.</p>
<p><strong>5- Fit’N’Burger At Roadster Diner</strong><br><img src="http://blogbaladi.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/163681_10150161170603776_7847312_n.jpg" alt="163681_10150161170603776_7847312_n" width="720" height="115"></p>
<p>The Fit’N’Burger was introduced as part of Roadster’s light menu and is a great burger. It contains grilled patty, rocket leaves, grilled onions, grilled tomatoes, grilled fresh mushrooms and a Light Homestyle sauce. I couldn’t find a picture to be honest so I borrowed one from Roadster’s Facebook page.</p>
<p><strong>6- Spiel Mozzarella Burger at Crepaway </strong><br><img src="http://blogbaladi.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/e564b351dc4e6f95a54aac28d7ac8242.jpg" alt="e564b351dc4e6f95a54aac28d7ac8242" width="720" height="540"><em>via <a href="http://www.pinterest.com/joellenassif/crepaway-the-place-to-be/">Joelle</a></em></p>
<p>This has been Crepaway’s signature burger for years. It comes with a thick chunk of deep-fried mozzarella.</p>
<p><strong>7- Shack Stack at Shake Shack </strong><br><img src="http://blogbaladi.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/IMG_0003.jpg" alt="IMG_0003" width="1024" height="768"><a href="http://www.foodieasshole.com/2013/10/bostons-shake-shack.html">Source</a></p>
<p>The Shack Stack is a cheeseburger and a ‘shroom burger topped with lettuce, tomato and ShakeSauce. Get the awesome Shake Shack’s cheese fries as well.</p>

<p>Meat patty, bacon and blueberry jam on top. Add to that a great bun and you have an <a href="http://blogbaladi.com/ferdinand-hamra-amazing-burger/">awesome burger</a>! </p>
<p><strong>9- Cheese Burgers at McDonald’s</strong><br><img src="http://blogbaladi.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/mcdonalds-cheeseburger-1680x1050.jpg" alt="mcdonalds-cheeseburger-1680x1050" width="1024" height="640"></p>
<p>I usually order them plain without the ketchup and onions and get McDonald’s BBQ sauce and dip them in it. </p>

<p>That’s the only burger I have at Burger King.</p>
<p>I am sure there are other burgers that I should try but these are the ones that first came to my mind and that I’ve had quite a few times in the past years (Except the Eau De vie one). Of course I sometimes miss having these big bulky Lebanese burgers with coleslaw and fries but I can’t think of any decent snack that makes them these days. I remember a small place called Khoury Inn in Dekwaneh that made good Lebanese burgers but I am not sure if it’s still open.</p>";s:17:"post_image_height";i:576;s:16:"post_image_width";i:1024;s:11:"post_visits";i:24;s:18:"post_twitterShares";i:8;s:19:"post_facebookShares";i:90;s:16:"post_totalShares";i:98;s:16:"post_socialScore";i:34;s:13:"post_virality";i:37;s:9:"blog_name";s:11:"Blog Baladi";s:16:"blog_description";s:89:"a non-political Lebanese blog that tackles various issues related to the Lebanese society";s:8:"blog_url";s:21:"http://blogbaladi.com";s:11:"blog_author";s:11:"Najib Mitri";s:28:"blog_author_twitter_username";s:7:"LeNajib";s:13:"blog_rss_feed";s:27:"http://blogbaladi.com/feed/";s:9:"blog_tags";s:7:"society";s:2:"id";i:22;s:11:"blog_active";i:1;s:24:"blog_last_post_timestamp";i:1401739680;}i:17;O:8:"stdClass":26:{s:7:"post_id";i:30552;s:8:"post_url";s:60:"http://tlkabtmovies.com/2014/06/02/muppets-most-wanted-2014/";s:10:"post_title";s:26:"Muppets Most Wanted [2014]";s:10:"post_image";s:78:"http://tlkabtmovies.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/muppets-most-wanted-poster.jpg";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:123:"The 2011 movie was one of the best surprises of the year and a huge success at the box office. “Muppets Most Wanted”...";s:7:"blog_id";s:12:"tlkabtmovies";s:14:"post_timestamp";i:1401709860;s:12:"post_content";s:1985:"<p><a href="https://tlkabtmovies.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/muppets-most-wanted-poster.jpg"><img src="http://tlkabtmovies.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/muppets-most-wanted-poster.jpg?w=201&h=300" alt="Muppets-Most-Wanted-Poster"></a>The 2011 movie was one of the best surprises of the year and a huge success at the box office. “Muppets Most Wanted”, while not as good as its predecessor, is still fun to watch. It reunites the team that made the first one so successful (without Jason Segel though and that’s a shame), including director James Bobin, and opens with a song called “We’re doing a sequel”. Nice try, but too much self awareness can ruin a picture, especially with characters that we love and admire. The plot this time around involves a ruthless agent (Ricky Gervais), who plans to have Kermit sent to the Gulag, while his evil Russian double replaces him on tour. From this point on, there is sufficient story, songs and gags to fill out an hour long TV special. Unfortunately, “Muppets Most Wanted” runs 108 minutes, and at some point you can feel the life draining from it. Is the movie still entertaining? Damn straight. It’s always a pleasure to see Kermit, Fozzie, Miss Piggy and the rest of the gang back onscreen. But truth be told, they deserve a better movie. And so do we.</p>

<p><span>Cafe Daniel (Bann Daniel) is back! First thing to notice is the logo which now contains the indication that is has been around since 1977 (but naturally it discounts the period when it was off the market). Daniel, along with Najjar and Abi Nasr were the staple ground coffee Arabica brands in Lebanon.</span></p>
<p><span>When a brand has been off the shelves for such a long time, it is a reason to change its identity and logo now that people forgot how it used to look like. But rest assured <a href="http://beirutntsc.blogspot.com/2014/05/cafe-daniel-is-back.html?m=1" target="_blank">Beirut/NTSC</a> has a picture of the old logo, which you will find was in typical 70s typo – the above logo it must be said is indeed a derivative of the old one, and has been revamped and lifted as opposed to being done from scratch.</span></p>
<p><img src="http://www.nogarlicnoonions.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Cafe-Daniel-12MB.jpg" alt="Cafe Daniel 12MB" width="600" height="800"></p>
<p><span>This naturally continues with the effort of building on a pre-existing brand and indicates the heritage that comes with it. The re-launch ad “yalli deye2… feye2″ harps on the same melody – “he who has tasted… shall remember” and obviously still sticks to people who knew Cafe Daniel as opposed to a new breed of clients from a younger generation. The TVC clearly indicates this, with very few people in the cast (perhaps just one) who are not at least sexagenarians.</span></p>
<p><img src="http://www.nogarlicnoonions.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Cafe-Daniel-relaunch.jpg" alt="Cafe Daniel relaunch" width="600" height="337"></p>
<p><strong><span>The only small annoyance is that the slogan reminds me a lot of “Iza de2et 3la2et” (if you have tasted, you are hooked) which is used massively by Zeit Boulos (Cafe Daniel with “he who has tasted… shall remember” is too close for comfort in that case). But what’s with Cafe Daniel being away for such a long time I won’t play the party spoiler for the homecoming queen!</span></strong></p>

<p><iframe src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/150268848&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_artwork=true&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false" width="100%" height="166" frameborder="no" scrolling="no"></iframe>When I heard this track by 6inho, I wanted to wear a leather jacket with a skull on my back and walk down the street slow-motion. It’s such a chill, deep and trippy track that is a pleasure to listen to while driving, working or having a get-together that’s not a rave, but people still wanna move with the beats a little.</p>
<p>The Unplugged Poets were also fans, so they took the track and added some sick lyrics to it and the flow turned out awesome. Check out this version above, and check <a href="https://soundcloud.com/6inho">6inho’s SoundCloud</a> for the one without the vocals.</p>
<h2>2- Tempus Fugit (3LIAS & Jimmy Van M Remix) – Marshall White</h2>
<p><iframe src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/151652140&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_artwork=true&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false" width="100%" height="166" frameborder="no" scrolling="no"></iframe> This rework of Marshall White’s Tempus Fugit by b018 giant 3LIAS (stamina) and the hottest addition to the b018 crew Jimmy Van M, is awesome. It’s deep and dark enough, with a glitchy melody that’ll make you move. It fits perfect with the b018 spirit, with the deep, dark sound coupled with a little something to make you look up and see the roof retract to see the city lights and starry nights above the iconic club.</p>
<h2>3- Get Togetha (Original Mix) – Jade and Diamond Setter</h2>
<p><iframe src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/20420671&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_artwork=true&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false" width="100%" height="166" frameborder="no" scrolling="no"></iframe>Jade was instrumental in my electronic music education. It’s at The Basement all those years ago where my true love for House and Tech House really solidified and where I saw dozens of amazing acts week after week, making me the self-proclaimed electronic music connoisseur I like to think of myself today. This track, along with the Jade and Diamond Setter rework of Lumi’s “Banging in the Stars” are some of the most memorable originals that take me back to those happy days. So, consider this track the blast from the past of this post.</p>
<h2>4- Never Mind – Ohm Hourani vs Ronin & Nesta</h2>
<p><iframe src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/144681876&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_artwork=true&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false" width="100%" height="166" frameborder="no" scrolling="no"></iframe> It’s like you need to take an elevator underground to feel safe listening to this awesome tech house track by our beloved friends Ronin & Nesta, and our main man at Stereo in Montreal, the Jordanian-born Ohm Hourani. Love the dreamy, dark melody on this one. I can definitely see it do numbers in clubs around the world, and it has already made it to #45 on the Beatport top 100 Tech House chart! So, enjoy!</p>
<h2>5- 3000 Years (Dub Mix) – ESC ft. Marlene Jaber</h2>

<p>This summer is gonna be big. That’s what we keep hearing, and what we all hope for. But, all the big festivals’ acts seem mediocre compared to other years. The massive acts we’re used to seeing gracing Lebanese stages have shrunken down to more niche, less mainstream acts, which is of course great, but then again, it shows a somewhat lack of confidence in how great the summer will be.</p>
<p>From chart-toppers like Lana Del Rey and the Petshop Boyz, to acts from decades ago and more indie acts, there is much less star power this summer.</p>
<p>Ellie Goulding is arguably the biggest, with over 10 top hits to her name in the last couple of years, and a very versatile discography ranging from deep electronic dance music, to radio-invading pop, she’s never really sold out. Proof? Listen to her epic acoustic versions to know she does have quite the voice. Then, listen to her chart-topping collabs with folks like Tinie Tempah. And then, watch her pull off covers of indie acts every hipster in Beirut adores (I’ll admit I love them too) Alt-J and The Weeknd.</p>
<p>So, if you’re looking for the summer’s biggest concert, with an artist that’s in now, whose songs most of you can sing along to, and in a large venue like BIEL, y’all know where to be on July 23rd (and tickets are already running out). <a href="https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=626662494085948">RSVP Here</a></p>

<blockquote><p>Samir Kassir was assassinated on June 2, 2005, in Beirut, when a bomb placed under his car was detonated. The tragic death of this journalist and writer was one of many attempts to silence Lebanese free thinkers, put an end to the Independence Intifada, and prevent Beirut’s winds of liberty from spreading across the region. Samir Kassir, who wrote Beirut’s history, has therefore become a part of this history.</p>
<p>The model of intellectual renaissance embodied by Samir Kassir during his life and at the moment of his death, through his articles and academic research, has placed him at the avant-garde of Lebanese and Arab opinion leaders who have paid their life to fight tyranny and lead their country to freedom and independence.

<p>Today we remember Samir Kassir.</p>
<p>Nine years ago to this day, a car bomb exploded in Beirut. The usual confusion that followed was soon replaced with a nation-wide shock. The victim this time was none another than Samir Kassir.</p>
<p>Kassir cannot be described in a few words, so I won’t try and do so. The son of a Palestinian father and a Syrian mother, Kassir was one of the most well known intellectuals of the Arab left. He was a strong supporter of the Palestinian cause, and of Secular Democracy throughout the Middle East. His attempt to defend universal principles of equality and justice and adopt them to a Pan-Arab context made him deeply unpopular with some, leading to his death – it is usually believed that it was his opposition to the Syrian government’s presence in Lebanon and his criticism of the Baath party that killed him.</p>
<p>The following is an extract from the book “<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Being-Arab-Samir-Kassir/dp/1844672808/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1401695501&sr=8-1&keywords=being+arab" target="_blank">Being Arab</a>” in which he popularized the concept of the “Arab Malaise”:</p>
<hr><p>
</p><p>
</p><p align="left"><strong>The worst aspect of the Arabs’ malaise is their refusal to emerge from it, but, if happiness is not in sight, some form of equilibrium at least is possible</strong><strong> </strong>[Extract as it appears in <em>Making the World Legible</em>]</p>
<p align="left">Some people are driven to despair by the Arab malaise. They believe that the Arabs are so profoundly trapped that they will never be able to break free and, in so believing, they only make the deadlock worse. This is the extreme variant of modernism, propounded by liberals, disappointed nationalists and former activists of the left alike. Decline, according to this way of thinking, is so widespread that it damns the very notion of a renaissance: the nahda† did not just end in failure, but it was also by its very nature a historical anomaly, an impossibility right from the outset. Worse still, all attempts to free the Arabs from their predicament, particularly nationalism, are considered to have only made the problem worse. Some of these disappointed souls go so far as to internalize the culturalist distinctions that legitimize imperial domination. Their most affirmative thesis, echoing the American neoconservatives, is that change and democracy can only come from such domination, not realizing that all this will achieve is to aggravate frustrations, exacerbate victimhood and the culture of death, and thereby perpetuate the Arab malaise. For, if they are to overcome their malaise, the Arabs have no choice but to do it themselves.</p>
<p align="left">
Then there are those people for whom things are never better than when everything’s wrong. Obviously these are the Islamist jihadists who, as good messianists, see the Arab malaise just as a bad moment to be got through – well, not as bad as all that actually, since it can be a way to gain paradise and the forty houris while waiting for that strange revolution which, unlike its Marxist original, is not seen as a leap into the future, but as a return to an original purity lost in the mists of time.</p>
<p align="left">
As a system of thought, jihadist Islamism is far from being the dominant ideology it is often portrayed as in the Western media. Yet it is powerful, no doubt because it is the only ideology that seems to offer relief from the victim status the Arabs delight in claiming (a status that in fact Islamism, jihadist or otherwise, is only too happy to confirm). Arab victimhood goes beyond the ‘Why do they hate us?’ question, which Arabs would be as entitled to ask as the Americans were on the morning of September 11. Inflamed by the West’s attitude to the Palestinian question, it has incorporated other elements, notably the feeling of powerlessness and also a certain crime-novel vision of history.</p>
<p align="left">
The cult of the victim claims that Arabs are the West’s primary target, totally disregarding the other peoples of the world, and world history in general. No mention is made of Africa and its systematic pillaging; of the Americas and the genocide of the pre-Columbian populations, perpetuated in the continued marginalization of their cultures, of Indochina and its decimated generations.</p>
<p align="left">
Of course I am not denying what we have presupposed, that the Arabs have nothing that might compensate them for their misfortune, and that the Arab world is the only region on earth where the West has continually acted as if it were the master – and still does today, either directly or through Israel. But this doesn’t change the fact that recognizing the threat to the Arab world is not the same as condoning Arab victimhood. None of the major figures of the renaissance showed any signs of indulging such a cult, nor the ideologues or practitioners of nationalism. Victims par excellence, the Palestinians avoided it in the past, and continue in a very large degree to do so, even if their situation fosters a propensity among those who helplessly look on to claim such a status.</p>
<p align="left">
Victimhood is the price of the defeat of the universal, rather than a product of the status quo, and its cult, served by the Arab media, in particular the much-lionized Al-Jazeera, has only been able to grow because the ideology of the moment preaches a refusal of the universal. Ideology is in fact a very grand word for the current amalgam of the fossilized remains of Arab nationalism, which, because of their age, have cut themselves off from their original, universalist sources of inspiration, and an ‘Islamic nationalism’ that explicitly sets out to differentiate itself from the universal, if not supplant it. Such a nationalist mishmash is not new. It was around at the end of the nineteenth century, propounded notably by Afghani. The only difference is that Afghani was a reformer of Islam, with a perfect knowledge of, and uninhibited dealings with, Western thought. The same cannot be said of his present-day successors, who abhor nothing so much as talk of religious reform.</p>
<p align="left">
Islamic nationalism isn’t just a synonym for jihadism. It is defensive in essence, whereas jihadism can in certain lights see itself as a new conquest of the world. But the distinction between the two is nonetheless a tenuous one, and there can be no doubt that Islamic nationalism prepares the ground for jihadism. For while it may not deny the Arab malaise, as jihadism does, it nonetheless predisposes those who complain of the malaise to wallow in it, so much so that they will only replace it with something similar: the culture of death which the union of fossilized Arab nationalism and political Islam calls resistance.</p>
<p align="left">
There is undoubtedly an inherent explanation of the culture of death – not that it is an invariant of Islam or an essence of Arabness, but rather that, as a spectacle of endless bloodshed, it instils a self-perpetuating logic of blood for blood. If there can be no victory, then at least there can be the consolation of bloodletting – others’ blood, obviously, but ours as well.</p>
<p align="left">
This logic may not be an invariant of Islam, but the fact remains that a religious vision of the world is at work here, even a religious vision in the sense of a system of cruelty, as Nietzsche put it. It goes without saying that this has nothing to do with the idea of sacrifice. Sacrifice has been at the root of all human conflict since the dawn of history, for the Arabs as much as anyone else, and this is the real meaning of jihad in the martial sense (there are also peaceful forms of jihad). In the twentieth century, the Palestinian fighters called themselves fedayeen, those ready to sacrifice their lives, like the Egyptian nationalists before them who fought the British at Suez. But in the new jihadism, death has ceased to be a potential, or even probable, price to be paid. Death has become the indispensable means to a desired end, if not an actual end in itself.</p>
<p align="left">
This vision of martial jihad incarnated in the figure of the istishhadi, the one who seeks martyrdom (the kamikaze, in other words), has no real antecedent in Arab-Muslim culture apart from the – non-Arab – sect of the Assassins. In the modern era, one has to wait until the Iranian revolution for its return. Shia at first, it emerged on the frontline of the Iraq-Iran war, where unbroken waves of volunteers checked the advance of the Iraqi armoured divisions before launching themselves against the Iraqi lines at the start of 1982. It appeared next in Lebanon in the form of individual suicide attacks against Western interests and the Israeli occupying forces. It should be noted that this extreme method may have been effective against the Americans, but traditional guerrilla tactics – ambushes, explosions and so on – were more decisive against the Israelis. Nonetheless other groups, some of them secular, adopted it as a model. Hezbollah gave it up when it became the only method of resistance, but kept the symbolism of blood and the totem of the istishhadi – a symbolism that it reinforces through the observance of Ashura. Originating in Iranian Shiism before passing to Lebanon and now Iraq, the rituals of this festival of redemptive suffering resemble certain bloody celebrations of Good Friday, in Spain for instance or the Philippines.</p>
<p align="left">
In principle, an insurmountable obstacle divides the Shia and the Sunni jihadists. Radical Sunni Islamism, as the doctrinal statements that have been coming out of Iraq show, holds Shia to be heretics and rafida, people who reject the true faith. Sunni Qur’anic literalism clearly also has its intellectual origins in South Asian Islam, notably the thought of Mawdudi, which, through the conduit of the Egyptian Sayyid Qutb, has permeated its takfiri, or apostatizing, strain. None of this matters, however. The martyrdom seekers first appeared in Shia circles, with the shahids recording their last testaments on video (the price of modernity). Furthermore, of the two Palestinian groups that have practised suicide bombing, one, Islamic Jihad, is reputed to be close to Iran, while the other, Hamas, although an offshoot of the Muslim Brotherhood, is on very good terms with Lebanese Hezbollah.</p>
<p align="left">   The proliferation of the culture of death and the evening-out of differences between Shias and Sunnis cannot be explained solely by the Islamization of the fight against Israel. Over and above actual events,<br>
the media, especially Al-Jazeera, have played a key role in this process, peddling a lowest-common-denominator mix of Arab nationalism and Islamic nationalism. It was doing this before September 11, defending means, justifying ends, claiming Arab victimhood. The Arab public has been systematically primed to accept the thesis of a ‘clash of civilizations’.</p>
<p align="left">
Nonetheless, we must be able to continue rebutting Huntingdon and remembering Lévi-Strauss. If we could address the protagonists of the ‘war against terror’ or the ‘jihad against the crusaders’ in academic terms, that ought surely to be the watchword of a new universalism.</p>
<p align="left">
Nothing is harder than rebutting Huntingdon at a time when people are doing their utmost to cultivate difference. On the one hand, politicians and commentators constantly invoke an Eastern essentialism, even if, after long tirades opposing ‘us’ and ‘them’, they see fit to stress that Arabs and Muslims should not all be lumped in with the terrorists. On the other, there is a tendency to qualify, or even justify, the horrors of New York in terms of the evils of American politics, even if people are careful to preface their remarks with the disclaimer that the murder of innocent people goes against every precept of Islam.</p>
<p align="left">
We must not forget Lévi-Strauss: ‘civilization’, as he says, is not a category and hence cannot contain ‘natural’ hierarchies; and humanity is one, since it rests on a common anthropological foundation. In other words, it is as meaningless to talk of an ‘attack on civilization’ as it is to classify people according to their adherence to a faith, Muslim or otherwise. I should perhaps point out that supremacy isn’t exclusively white. Some people in Muslim societies may be drawn to radical Islam for defensive reasons, because they feel under threat, but the rhetoric used by the warlords of radical Islamism is intentionally offensive. They justify their triumphalist proselytizing by defining the ‘decadent’ civilization of the Other as inferior.</p>
<p align="left">
So it is not just the West that needs to re-examine its stance. The Arab world in particular needs to make a profound effort to eradicate the ambiguities that encourage a logic of cultural confrontation. This means first putting victimhood into perspective. We must replace Arabs’ customary assumption of victim status not by cultivating a logic of power or a spirit of revenge, but by recognizing the fact that, despite bringing defeats, the twentieth century has also brought benefits that can enable Arabs to participate in progress. Equally, we must reject the moral pragmatism lurking in the cult of the victim. If we cannot accept the powerful saying that the ends justify the means, then we can’t let the victims do so either. We must not confuse terrorism with resistance, as the West confuses resistance with terrorism.</p>
<p align="left">
But, apart from the effects and means of confrontation, if the Arab world is to reject a clash of civilizations, then we must also give up a negative Arabocentrism (or Islamocentrism) which sees world history purely as a threat to us, and as a ‘cultural’, rather than political or military, threat. By the same token, we must renounce essentialist justifications of the sort that explain the silence surrounding the long affair of the Western hostages in Lebanon in the 1980s, or the indulgent attitudes towards the fatwa against Salman Rushdie. We must accept that democratic values are now part of humanity’s shared heritage.</p>
<p align="left">
Such a re-examination could take place. The problem is that the elites that might push for it are caught between non-democratic regimes (frequently supported by the West, despite the ‘democratic crusade’ in<br>
the Middle East), on the one hand, and radical Islamism on the other. It goes without saying that the task would be easier if it was accompanied by another renaissance that had as many forms as it did inspirations, a renaissance that is still perfectly possible.</p>

<p>When I first set out to build <em>Lebanese Blogs</em>, my idea was to create a new space to read blogs without the stress of another inbox in our lives (all those unread items in google reader drove me nuts). <em>Lebanese Blogs</em>, in my mind, is much more than an RSS reader. It is a space for discovering, organizing and learning about our community.</p>
<p>That said however, I realize that some habits die hard and that not everybody has the same needs. Some people really do enjoy plowing through their feed reader every evening (heck I still do that myself for international tech and media blogs). Moreover, my ultimate objective is for our bloggers to have the widest readership possible. This is why I decided to publish RSS feeds, and make them awesome at that.</p>
<h3>The best RSS feeds on Lebanon’s internet</h3>
<p><em>Lebanese Blogs</em> now publishes a <a href="http://lebaneseblogs.com/feed">general RSS feed</a> which includes all the blog posts. But that is overkill for most of you (people who like fashion often don’t want to read about politics and vice versa), so I also published category feeds (<a href="http://lebaneseblogs.com/feed/food">food</a>, <a href="http://lebaneseblogs.com/feed/fashion">fashion</a>, <a href="http://lebaneseblogs.com/feed/politics">politics</a>, <a href="http://lebaneseblogs.com/feed/design">design</a>, <a href="http://lebaneseblogs.com/feed/columnists">columnists</a>, <a href="http://lebaneseblogs.com/feed/tech">tech</a>, <a href="http://lebaneseblogs.com/feed/society">society</a>, <a href="http://lebaneseblogs.com/feed/media">media</a>) which allow you to cherry pick what you’re interested in (be mindful though that some bloggers exist in several categories, so you might experience some duplicate items if you’re subscribed to more than one category feed).</p>
<p>Also, unlike other aggregation feeds, ours offer blogger-specific details. For example, each post suggests that you follow its author on Twitter and tries to encourage you to read the post on the blog itself.</p>
<h3>A note to bloggers and authors</h3>
<p>The articles on the feed only include your post’s image and a tiny excerpt. If readers are interested in the post, they’ll have to read it on your own site. I don’t want this feed to be an alternative to your blog.</p>
<p>I hope you really enjoy this feature and, as always, if you have further questions don’t hesitate to <a href="http://twitter.com/beirutspring">drop me a tweet</a>..<br>

<p>The floral prints continues for the summer. Be prepared to embrace your inner lady with floral print dresses, swimsuits, shoes, and even sunglasses. Like u already saw through our blog, we adore this iconic pattern !!!The next floral trend we decided to cover was the mood for something a little more feminine, like floral cocktail dresses. The light blue and white patterned dress suits very well the atmosphere of the beach season. For more elegancy, pair it with white heeled sandals and a very funky reflective sunglasses. So come on ladies, give floral prints a try this summer too  if you want a touch of beauty and romance in your wardrobe.</p>

Last week we took a closer look at <strong><a href="http://ivysays.com/2014/05/22/profiling-lebanons-next-first-lady-sethrida-geagea/">Sethrida Geagea,</a></strong> wife of presidential candidate Samir Geagea. This week, Rima Karkafi Frangieh is on our fashion radar, wife of presidential hopeful and Marada party leader Sleiman Frangieh.</p>
<p>Rima is Sleiman’s second wife and mother of his youngest child Vera. Before wedding Frangieh in 2003, Rima worked as a TV presenter at the Lebanese Broadcasting Corporation (LBC) for seven years. Prior to that Rima who hails from an Iraqi mother and Lebanese father lived and attended university in Sydney after fleeing the war in Lebanon. Rima is most known for her social activism most notably in the North where she resides and volunteers her time to various charity causes and is the President of Ehdeniyat International Festival as well as the North Autism center.</p>
<p>In spite of her husband’s somewhat bleak chances of becoming president, there’s no denying Rima’s first lady material. With her feminine style and signature hair Rima will add a dainty allure to the presidential palace. We have no doubt she’ll be able to hold her ground amongst the world’s most fashionable first ladies.</p>
<p>Take a look at Rima Frangieh’s most fashionable moments.</p>

<p>The studies <a href="http://greenresistance.wordpress.com/2014/05/30/lebanons-polluted-rivers/">conducted</a> by the Beirut Arab University and the Lebanese University researchers have shown high concentration of heavy metals, residue from olive oil production, dangerous bacteria and other toxins being illegally dumped in the Hasbani River in South Lebanon and the Lower Litani River Basin.</p>
<p>Our sea is polluted, our rivers are polluted, our crops are <a href="http://blogbaladi.com/is-this-true/">watered</a> with sewers, our cities are polluted and we’re setting forests on fire to replace them with polluting buildings and industries. It’s looking bad but it’s never too late to do something about it. Environment Minister Mohammad Machnouk said he will develop a plan of action to prevent pollution in Qaraoun Lake and the Litani River Basin so let’s hope he does it ASAP.</p>
<blockquote><p>Lebanon’s rivers are alarmingly polluted with untreated sewage and waste, posing health risks for consumers who use the water at home and for farmers who irrigate their crops with it, local scientists warned.</p>
<p>The latest findings, which confirm the results of a slew of research on river pollution over the past decade, come ahead of the government’s unveiling of a road map next week to fight the contamination of the Litani River Basin and Qaraoun Lake.</p>
<p>Two new studies by Beirut Arab University and Lebanese University researchers show high concentrations of heavy metals, residue from olive oil production, dangerous bacteria and other toxins – evidence of untreated waste and illegal dumping in the Hasbani River in South Lebanon and the Lower Litani River Basin.

<p>Stereokitchen is a new 500 sq.m restaurant/ bar that opened in building in Pasteur st., Beirut, Lebanon. Designed by architect <strong>Paul Kaloustian</strong>, the main theme while designing was basing the layout around a perfect circle, this way the restaurant will make most of the breathtaking views surrounding the buildin, spacially that it is glass all around.</p>
<p>Materials used give a very neutral appearance, focusing on exposed concrete, wood, and light colored furniture, no drama was intended with this concept. Ceiling & lighting was designed by the famous Beirut based lighting company .<a href="http://saharghazale.com//?s=PSLAB&x=0&y=0#utm_source=feed&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=feed">PSLAB</a>.</p>

<p>Here’s the thing, there are more misconceptions about being a feminist than there are about Lebanese politics. That being said, I am still a furious feminist.<br>
I don’t say it to bug people. It’s who I am and I am proud of it, despite the hatred I get for it.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span></span></p>
<p>When someone says the word “feminism,” the first thoughts that cross my mind are of the astounding forthright women who were involved in the Women’s Liberation Movement in the late 60s and 70s. It is surprising and sad, however, that this is not the picture most people envision when I say the word ‘feminist.’</p>
<p>As an activist for gender equality, I often ask myself; how has such an inspirational term transformed into a pejorative offense? The answer is in the socially constructed connotation of the word, and in what it means to be a feminist in this part of the world.</p>
<p>Last week, I was with some friends walking around Hamra when this adorable baby girl passed by; I couldn’t help but notice how cute she was. The words I heard next were wounding and uncalled for; “but you’re a feminist, how can you have that motherly feeling?” someone said. The level of disregard and impertinence that people have towards women who are outspoken and demand equality is beyond my understanding. Am I not allowed to love children because I want to be treated equally? Am I not permitted to act like the woman I am and long to be a mother because I want to abolish the pay gap? Am I not to be respected as a human being because I am opinionated and frank? There are major myths about feminism that need to debunked, now.</p>
<p>As usual with these much-contested topics, the term has a range of explanations; some virtuous, some more offensive and false. To many, it means that women and men should be considered equals in all aspects, as [not-so-simple] as it may sound. To others, it is a liberating term that allows for women to choose whatever lifestyle they please without being judged or labeled.</p>
<p>What many people do not understand is that it shouldn’t and doesn’t blindly signify a Marxist, anti-capitalist, anti-family, political movement that encourages women to leave their husbands, become lesbians, or even practice sorcery. There is nothing wrong with being all those things if you wish to be, but you don’t have to be in order to identify yourself as a feminist.</p>
<p>When I read news about young girls getting kidnapped, brutally assaulted and forced into marriage, about women getting fired for ‘asking too much,’ about females worldwide being sidelined, frequently sexualized and regularly stereotyped, I cannot help but identify as a feminist.</p>
<p>I feel that if you’re a person who can confidently say ‘I recognize injustice in the world,’ people are going to attack and depreciate you. I’ve noticed that most people find it a hell of a lot easier to say ‘you’re a feminazi’ rather than having to deal with the mere fact that perhaps our institutions are fabricated in a way that values some and oppresses others. It’s easier to dismiss a woman as a freak than to listen to her critique of society.</p>
<p>So just as a reminder, I am not a bra-burning man-hater who encourages all women to perform abortions and murder their partners. Feminism is not about combating men or femininity, but fundamentally about fighting inequality and oppression. And yes, you can possess a Y chromosome and be a feminist. If you believe women should be politically, socially, and economically equal to men, then guess what? You already are one.<br>

<p>Here is a glimpse of some of the local reactions which surfaced as the details of this huge announcement started spreading:</p>
<p>- Lebanese singers announced that they are not threatened by the new comers since “<strong>el se7a el fanniyye betse3 el kell</strong>”<br>
- A big comity of poets was formed to create weird combination of titles for the visiting singers such as “Amirat Kawakib El Ghina2″ or “Sa7ib al 7Ounjoura al Zahabiyya”<br>
- Lebanese security apparatus kicked off an intense research on the background of each performer to <strong>BAN any of them</strong> that ever sang anything that contains the word Jews or that rhymes with it like Juice or other…<br>
- Local producers started preparing the recording kit to make sure all songs are available to the public on CD and <strong>most importantly on Cassette</strong> (also written K7)<br>
- Voice Over professionals started rehearsing the line “You7yi al sahra da7ik el layl Elie Ayoub”<br>
- The Miss Lebanon comity offered the visiting singers <strong>a chance to be on the judging panel of the beauty pageant</strong> despite the fact that singing has nothing to do with beauty<br>
- Lebanese Script writers completed the work on all the lines that the International Singers should make sure to state loudly on stage such as repeatedly mispronouncing “marhaba” and making sure to thank Simon Asmar or Prince Walid Ben Talal<br>
- Arab patriots started lobbying to get the multinational stars aboard their new project: “The return of : Al 7elm Al 3Arabi”<br>
- Lebanese Embassies were instructed to include extremely tough VISA conditions which would guarantee none of the stars <strong>would stay in Lebanon illegally or marry one of the locals just to obtain citizenship</strong> (especially after the <a href="http://blogoftheboss.com/a-lebanese-american-wedding-sneak-previews-from-the-george-clooney-amal-alamuddin-nuptials/" title="George Clooney – Amal Alamuddin: My Big Fat Lebanese-American Wedding?" target="_blank">Clooney-Alameddin</a> so called love story)</p>";s:17:"post_image_height";i:500;s:16:"post_image_width";i:500;s:11:"post_visits";i:19;s:18:"post_twitterShares";i:52;s:19:"post_facebookShares";i:298;s:16:"post_totalShares";i:350;s:16:"post_socialScore";i:43;s:13:"post_virality";i:47;s:9:"blog_name";s:16:"Blog of the Boss";s:16:"blog_description";s:68:"Strong believer in social change and in the healing power of comedy.";s:8:"blog_url";s:25:"http://blogoftheboss.com/";s:11:"blog_author";s:10:"Ralph Aoun";s:28:"blog_author_twitter_username";s:9:"ralphaoun";s:13:"blog_rss_feed";s:30:"http://blogoftheboss.com/feed/";s:9:"blog_tags";s:17:"politics, society";s:2:"id";i:287;s:11:"blog_active";i:1;s:24:"blog_last_post_timestamp";i:1401669000;}i:41;O:8:"stdClass":26:{s:7:"post_id";i:30559;s:8:"post_url";s:38:"http://www.larmoiredelana.com/?p=14699";s:10:"post_title";s:37:"Tricks and Trends: I’m Blue Dabadee";s:10:"post_image";s:79:"http://www.larmoiredelana.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/1A0A6266-700px-web.jpg";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:123:"The color blue was thankfully voted the Pantone 2014 color.

I know I’ve mentioned it several times already but it’s my favorite color e-v-e-r. I believe that throughout our existences, we are always looking to achieve serenity, throughout our daily actions and the goals that we set to complete. For me, blue fully represents serenity and everything that’s soothing. It’s not a wonder that it was proven to be the best color for a bedroom in many statistics. Yes, if your room is blue, you have more chances of sleeping more! Today’s post is a tribute to this color in a hue that suits most skin, hair and eye colors. It just gives a beautiful glow to your face that will not let your outfit be unnoticed. For this summer, make sure to mix it with neutrals like white and nude or clear colors like any pastel shades. Adding a hint of exotic skin to your outfits also never hurts!</span></p>

<p>I read that the app <a href="http://www.lorientlejour.com/article/869560/un-jeune-libanais-lance-une-application-iphone-a-succes.html">reached</a> the top of the productivity apps list on the App Store but that’s for the Lebanese App store of course. Nevertheless, Ghobril’s app “Mingle” has been <a href="http://www.appannie.com/apps/ios/app/851851633/app-ranking/#daily=2014-06-01&type=ranks">performing</a> quick well worldwide as you can see in the below screenshot. It reached the #4 rank in the productivity apps list in France and #5 in the UAE.</p>
<p>Moreover, Mingle has got some pretty cool reviews from Tech Crunch and Minimal Mac and others. Sarah Perez from TechCrunch described the app as “a cleaner and less sluggish type of contacts application”. I don’t know if I would make use of such an app but it’s definitely worth a try.</p>
<p>You can download it [<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/mingle-action-based-contacts/id851851633?ls=1&mt=8">Here</a>].</p>
<blockquote><p>Mingle was built from the ground up to make connecting with your contacts faster, easier, and more enjoyable in every way!</p>
<p>Some of Mingle’s greatest features:</p>
<p>Super fast & intuitive interface<br>
Numerous actions to fit your every need, from Phone to Twitter to Fantastical interactions<br>
Custom actions, where the possibilities are endless</p></blockquote>

Well, sort of.</div><div><br></div><div>Ever since I heard the news of a <i>Boys Meets World</i> sequel coming to life (back in November 2012), I got really excited. The show was an inspirational hit when I was growing up, and one of the few ‘90s shows that I still gladly watch in reruns on a late Sunday night. So the thought of seeing Cory and Topanga on my screen in 2014 seemed like a fan-fiction dream come true.</div><div><br></div><div>With this news though, came the dread that the new show might stink. While it still hasn’t aired on the Disney Channel (June 27), the pilot was released on Disney Now and can be found online.</div><div><br></div><div>There’s definitely a sense of nostalgia while watching <i>Girl Meets World</i> - seeing Cornelius (I just love saying that) and Topanga together on screen brings back beautiful flashbacks - but the entire show screams “Disney”.</div><div><br></div><div>The horrible, horrible laugh-track plus the tacky dialogue, the wacky characters, the very bright colors, the clothes and a lot more were just too “Disney” for my taste. Obviously, it had to be because unlike <i>Boy Meets World,</i> this show is aimed more at kids under the age of 15. I can’t see it going down the same road <i>BMW</i> took (no pun intended) simply because its predecessor tackled many serious issues and was more about life lessons than this show can possibly ever become. Also, how many times do you have to say the word “world” in the first episode? That was very lame.</div><div><br></div><div>Maybe <i>BMW</i>’s entire first season was just as goofy and Disney-like as the first episode of <i>GMW</i>, so that would mean the show could possibly become a hit (although I just can’t see it going that way). Either way, little things like the character of Farkle Minkus (yes, Minkus!!) was handled hideously. He was just an annoying little kid trying to be funny, but that scene with him randomly jumping on Cory’s back was beyond frustrating.</div><div><br></div><div>It helps that the lead character, Riley Mathews (C & T’s daughter), is likeable (but only a little) and her best friend, Maya (the new Shawn), is interesting enough to give this show another chance, but I only kept watching because I wanted to see more Cory and more Topanga (seriously, where was she during the rest of the episode?).</div><div><br></div><div>Luckily, they knew how to wow us with that final cameo appearance of Mr. Feeny, a scene that was incredibly moving (and has to be for any <i>BMW</i> fan) regardless of how short it was.

<p><span><strong>I met Anas Chao first through a series of e-mails. He was a follower of this blog, and was going to be in Beirut and suggested we meet. We became fast friends and ended-up exploring the old souks of Sidon together. Anas speaks fluent Lebanese Arabic, resides in Taipei, but grew up in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, where his dad was stationed for work. He trained as a graphic designer but is  keenly interested in Lebanese cuisine. He is also a talented photographer. Watching  the locals’ delighted reaction when they would hear him address them in flawless Arabic was a sight to behold! </strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Back in Taipei, Anas started his own business, aptly called<a href="http://www.a-meal.com/"> A Meal</a>, in which he cooked private parties at his home studio for people interested in Middle-Eastern inspired cuisine.  Apparently there are no Middle-Eastern restaurants in Taipei. His business has been picking-up, as there are more people than he imagined who are amateurs of  this type of food. </strong></p>
<p><strong><span>I was really curious to see his menu, and he graciously gave me the recipe for the item that interested me the most. <em>Chicken in zaatar and tahini sauce</em>. I had to try it. Tahini sauce (tarator) and <em>zaatar</em> are not normally combined in Lebanon. What is more traditional is to mix tahini sauce with fresh parsley or cilantro. Turned out the combo is yummy! This is an easy and delicious meal. </span></strong></p>
<p><span><strong>INGREDIENTS: (slightly adapted)</strong></span></p>
<ul><li><span><strong>2 chicken breasts, cut into thumb-size</strong></span></li>
<li><span><strong>Marinade: 1 tablespoon mashed garlic, 1/2 teaspoon black pepper, salt to taste and 1 cup olive oil</strong></span></li>
<li><span><strong>1/4 cup zaatar</strong></span></li>
<li><span><strong>Tahini sauce: 1/2 cup tahini</strong></span></li>
<li><span><strong>1 large lemon, juiced</strong></span></li>
<li><span><strong>4 garlic cloves, mashed with salt</strong></span></li>
<li><span><strong>1/2 cup water or more as needed to make it smooth</strong></span></li>
<li><span><strong>2 tomatoes, sliced (or cherry tomatoes)</strong></span></li>
<li><span><strong>2 onions, sliced (or pearl onions)</strong></span></li>
</ul><p><span><strong>1. Marinate the chicken pieces overnight. The next day, drain and pan-fry the chicken (Anas baked it till done). Coat with the tahini sauce mixed with zaatar. Serve with tomatoes and onions. Anas roasted cherry tomatoes and onions in the oven, I sliced tomatoes and served them raw.  </strong></span></p>

<p>I rarely share press releases but this one is quite interesting and a major step forward for the Lebanese olive oil production. As you all know, Lebanon is renowned for its sprawling olive orchards yet hasn’t been doing well in the olive oil market mainly due to the high cost of production, its inadequate quality due to poor processing and of course the competition with cheaper non-Lebanese oils. </p>
<p>This being said, USAID and LIVCD (Lebanon Industry Value Chain Development) launched an initiative aimed at developing a seal to certify the quality and origin of Lebanese olive oil. The project “<a href="http://www.dailystar.com.lb/News/Lebanon-News/2014/May-29/258178-politics-economy-harm-lebanons-olive-oil.ashx">aims</a> to increase the productivity of olive trees by simultaneously lowering costs, standardizing milling and storage processes and creating incentives for the market to support Lebanese olive oil”. The seal will benefit the Lebanese olive oil sector by facilitating producers’ access to markets, while building consumer trust in both the quality and origin of the oil purchased. The LIVCD and IMC are expected to finalize and distribute the seal to certify producers, millers and bottlers, restaurants, and hotels in the coming months.</p>
<blockquote><p>Key actors in the olive oil sector in Lebanon gathered on May 29th, 2014 to launch an initiative to develop a seal to certify the quality and origin of Lebanese olive oil. The initiative is spearheaded by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) funded<br>
Lebanon Industry Value Chain Development (LIVCD) project in cooperation with the Mediterranean Institute of Certification (IMC). The event brought together seventy olive oil producers, mill owners, bottlers, exporters, and representatives from agricultural<br>
cooperatives. The seal will benefit the Lebanese olive oil sector by facilitating producers’ access to markets, while building consumer trust in both the quality and origin of the oil purchased. </p>
<p>In her opening words, LIVCD Chief of Party Dr. Jane Gleason explained: “Lebanese olive oil producers are facing major challenges in selling their produce and accessing local and export markets because of competition with cheaper non-Lebanese oils. Much of Lebanese oil is of<br>
inadequate quality due to poor processing. Lebanese consumers do not know for sure if they are buying oil of Lebanese origin, and if this oil is extra-virgin quality. The development and the promotion of the seal will open new opportunities for Lebanese olive oil and for<br>
extra virgin olive oil processors across Lebanon. USAID and LIVCD hope to achieve these objectives, with support from private sector investors” </p></blockquote>";s:17:"post_image_height";i:498;s:16:"post_image_width";i:780;s:11:"post_visits";i:10;s:18:"post_twitterShares";i:8;s:19:"post_facebookShares";i:22;s:16:"post_totalShares";i:30;s:16:"post_socialScore";i:24;s:13:"post_virality";i:27;s:9:"blog_name";s:11:"Blog Baladi";s:16:"blog_description";s:89:"a non-political Lebanese blog that tackles various issues related to the Lebanese society";s:8:"blog_url";s:21:"http://blogbaladi.com";s:11:"blog_author";s:11:"Najib Mitri";s:28:"blog_author_twitter_username";s:7:"LeNajib";s:13:"blog_rss_feed";s:27:"http://blogbaladi.com/feed/";s:9:"blog_tags";s:7:"society";s:2:"id";i:22;s:11:"blog_active";i:1;s:24:"blog_last_post_timestamp";i:1401739680;}i:47;O:8:"stdClass":26:{s:7:"post_id";i:30518;s:8:"post_url";s:106:"http://thepresentperfect.wordpress.com/2014/06/01/international-educator-interviews-jodie-in-buenos-aires/";s:10:"post_title";s:55:"International Educator Interviews: Jodi in Buenos Aires";s:10:"post_image";s:88:"http://thepresentperfect.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/cropped-8717690419_4a3dd75e7c_h.jpg";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:123:"Today’s interview features my dear friend Jodi whom I met during my time in Beirut.

The “Flying Burger” has been developed by a team of chefs using three different cuts of British beef — chuck, cheek and onglet.</strong></p>

<p>It will be served with a side of triple-cooked chips and a choice of relishes, and will be available on long-haul flights. BA will also serve a “Grounded Burger” in its First and Concorde lounges. It will feature a different recipe for pre-flight dining.The Flying Burger’s ingredients include 100 per cent British beef, Monterey Jack cheese, gherkins, tomato relish and a brioche bun.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nogarlicnoonions.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/ba-burger.jpg"><img src="http://www.nogarlicnoonions.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/ba-burger.jpg" alt="ba-burger" width="690" height="499"></a></p>
<p>Mark Tazzioli, BA’s chef, said: “Burgers are experiencing a renaissance right now, with pop-up burger bars and food trucks opening in all the major cities. Burgers are the ultimate tasty satisfying treat and ‘comfort food’ we crave when flying.</p>
<p>“It has taken months of trials to ensure we get the perfect texture and succulence, not just for the British palate, but for the hundreds of other nationalities that fly with us.”</p>
<p><strong>He added: “As taste buds are affected at altitude, we have created an original patty, which has proven extremely popular in taste-tests.”</strong></p>

And slthough each component in its own right is interesting and have a story to tell, it does get a little boring now and then, always these same faces and same looks. </span></div><div><span> </span><span>  </span><br><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-FERTG230qFg/U4tGm56q6OI/AAAAAAAAKqI/yg4k-zQtKqo/s1600/IMG_2471.JPG" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-FERTG230qFg/U4tGm56q6OI/AAAAAAAAKqI/yg4k-zQtKqo/s1600/IMG_2471.JPG" height="376" width="640"></a></td></tr><tr><td>Funky gear for sale</td></tr></tbody></table><span> </span><br><br><div><span>But today, on Hamra Street, I saw them all together! And they all mingled, quite nicely as well, and it looked good. </span></div><div><span>Morose teenagers in black with bad hair cuts and pimples, veiled muhajababes, grey-hair ladies that refuse to dye their hair, the alternative youngsters, the obviously well-to-do and the not-so-well-to-do, dadies in suits and daddies with kids on their necks, men pushing baby strollers, construction workers and housekeepers, bankers and bakers, ladies with short hair, ladies with tattoos and piercings and ladies with filled up lips and cheekbones, it all merged, and it had a very good feel to it. Just walking the street and seeing the crowd was a positive experience in itself. The street had good vibes, we'd say (but I do not know where you'd say that), it just sounded right. </span></div><div><span> </span></div><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ZBJ3b_wWKS0/U4tGlENKICI/AAAAAAAAKp4/Yj-hGGb1rHc/s1600/IMG_2512.JPG" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ZBJ3b_wWKS0/U4tGlENKICI/AAAAAAAAKp4/Yj-hGGb1rHc/s1600/IMG_2512.JPG" height="480" width="640"></a></td></tr><tr><td>Some good musicians</td></tr></tbody></table><div><span>It was good to see some street musicians, and people selling their home made products, whether it was honey, cookies or woven bracelets. It was also good to see they served alcohol for a change. I feel it is often the heathens like I that have to constantly adapt to the mores of a more conservative society, but it was good to see that this does not always have to be the case.  I ran into several friends, all in the same mind set. </span></div><div><span>And so overall a good and mellow ‘jauw’, as we say in Arabic.
