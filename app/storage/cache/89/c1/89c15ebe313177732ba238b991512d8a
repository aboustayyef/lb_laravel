<p>Nguyen, became a celebrity when Flappy Bird began gaining attention on iOS and Android devices and topped both platforms’ free charts. The game was downloaded 50 million times before it was removed from  the App Store for being “too addictive”.</p>
<p>Nguyen has been also reportedly working on other games.</p>

<p>The voice integration means a “smarter” conversation with the app. Smarter as in more intuitive. Hence definitely much more productive and efficient results. The process is simple, Android users are familiar with it: You just have to tap the microphone or say “Ok Google”. then you can ask questions like about upcoming sports games, the weather, or any other inquiry you might have in mind, the same way you would ask Siri.</p>
<p>Google Now has gained new cards that will surface interesting articles for your favorite topics and your favorite authors. It has also gained support for cricket sports cards (not that it really matters for us here in Lebanon).</p>

<p>When you search the web on how to hack a Facebook account, a huge list of websites will pop up and this number is on the rise.</p>
<p>Those websites might claim that they are able to get you any Facebook account credentials in minutes, some might claim to do it live in front of you, and some might claim other lies. They can be very good at misleading you and will try anything just to fool you into clicking on their websites.</p>
<p>When you visit those sites, you are exposed to many sorts of troubles:</p>
<ol><li>Those websites might claim that they have the required information but will need money so they hand it out to you. Once you send them the money, the password will still not be there and guess what, they now have your debit/credit card information.</li>
<li>Those websites might redirect you to surveys which you might end up completing and make them earn money.</li>
<li>Those websites might download and install all sorts of malwares on your PC.</li>
</ol><p>So to protect yourself, do not believe anything those websites might tell you. What is too good to be true, is in fact a lie. At Hackernewsbulletin.com they have compiled a list of those websites which you can check <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/~www.scribd.com/doc/222926730/List-of-Harmful-Websites-making-you-Fool-in-the-name-of-Facebook-Hacking" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<h3>New wifi method facilitating hackers job: Stealing ATM users PIN</h3>
<p>The best thing that a hacker can steal, and that he considers to be a jackpot is the personal identification numbers of financial accounts. Those bits of information are usually tightly secured and encrypted. And hackers are finding better techniques to steal PINs at ATM’s. Bryan Sartin, director of the team at Verizon Communications (VZ) that investigates data breaches declares:</p>
<blockquote><p>It just blows you away how sophisticated these folks are in thinking this stuff up.</p></blockquote>
<p>Banks use wireless Internet connection to monitor their ATM’s in all sorts of ways, but hackers are still able to find new ways to fetch the PINs remotely ands ultimately get hold of them. How?! Well these hackers get jobs with technical-support-companies which means they get access to the ATMs. After that, they can install malware that potentially send PIN data by email or by phone.</p>
<p>Another way is the use of chips and transmitters that enable PIN hacking, David Robertson, publisher of the Nilson Report, states that these chips are getting thinner and lighter and harder to detect. And that in many cases, hackers gear can’t be detected by the software that remotely monitors the weight of the Point of Sales.</p>
<blockquote><p>They’ve done it in a way that suggests a very serious effort to try to crack this industry.</p></blockquote>
<p>Robertson explains that U.S. consumers carry old magnetic-stripe cards (which we have in Lebanon too) which are more vulnerable to PIN capture than cards with RFID chips, which verify that the original card is present for every transaction. “There’s nothing about PINs in 2014 that’s different than PINs in 1994,” he says. “ATMs are in need of even more defence.”</p>

<h3>Facebook. Google, Twitter, as well as many other websites login protocol are hacked</h3>
<p>A security flaw in the OAuth and OpenID online login protocols could be used to steal data and redirect users to malicious websites, CNET reports.</p>
<p>This flaw, also called “Covert Redirect”, takes advantage of the fact that we use login pop-up windows most of the times, such as when you want to login to a website through Facebook, and those popups use OAUTH. Hackers take advantage of this breach on the affected site’s domain. It can’t be avoided like the phishing attack where u make sure of the websites you are visiting but “instead of using a Fake domain name, Covert Redirect flaw uses the real site address for authentication.”</p>
<p>Authorising the app will transfer your data to the attacker instead of reaching a legitimate site like Facebook or Google. Thus, personal data including email addresses, birth dates, contact lists and even control of the account could be given to hackers.</p>
<p>The one and only way for protecting yourself is closing any suspicious pop-up windows that appears demanding login credentials for your accounts.</p>
<h3>7 Surprising facts from Check Point 2014 Security Report</h3>
<ol><li>On a year-over-year basis, Check Point found that across the industrial, finance, government and telco sectors, the percentage of organizations with at least one potential data loss event is growing.</li>
<li>Fifty-eight percent of organizations downloaded malware every two hours or less.</li>
<li>Infected hosts, which become bots in a botnet, need to communicate with their command and control center to get instructions. In 2013, Check Point found that the frequency of bot communications increased, with 47 percent of communications happening at least once per hour.</li>
<li>There are multiple attack vectors used today, including buffer overflow (36% of the organizations are affected), which is a form of memory corruption.</li>
<li>Once again, Microsoft was the most attacked platform in 2013.</li>
<li>Malware can use a number of payload formats, but in 2013, Check Point found that 35 percent (the highest percentage) of unknown malware used the Adobe PDF format.</li>
<li>In addition to malware threats, misconfiguration is a significant IT risk. One-third of hosts analyzed by Check Point were not running updated software versions of Flash, Java and Internet Explorer.</li>

<h3>10 reasons today’s malware threats Require defence in-depth</h3>
<ol><li>You can’t keep safe just by running an antivirus scanner. Symantec itself acknowledges that with a fully updated antivirus, the user is only protected against half of the threats out there.</li>
<li>Employees are uninformed. Companies need to educate their employees on how to use their PC’s in a secure way. Most of the time, employees would click on phishing and dangerous websites without understanding the security issues they are putting the company through.</li>
<li>Mobile threats are on the rise. Android is now more targeted by malwares than Windows itself.</li>
<li>Security firms can’t keep up with malware distributors. They are far behind hackers, and when they find a threat to work on, chances are this threat was there for long enough to do sizeable harm. Security firms can’t be relied upon as the only line of defence.</li>
<li>The focus people place on security is wrong. When we hear massive data breach we focus on security issues that causes them, however what we don’t focus on is how we are using the Internet, how web companies are securing their servers or how can we automate security processes to dull the blow of major outbreaks.</li>
<li>More entry points: Today it is not the computer only who is the threat for security issues, but tablets, phones and ATM’s has also joined in.</li>
<li>The great assumption risk: Most of the users use their mobiles and browse online with the assumption that they are safe. If malwares on mobiles were not that hidden, users would have more interest in protecting themselves.</li>
<li>The great server conundrum: We never thought of the amount of information we should actually share with online companies. Once we share this information, it is placed on a server, with the implicit faith that they did actually and properly encrypt their data and secure it. Servers stand between our relative privacy and the prospect of having our identity stolen.</li>
<li>There’s a trust issue: People today believe that if they download an antivirus and share information on reputable sites only, they will be safe in principle. In fact hackers rely on this kind of trust to wreak havoc on unsuspecting victims.</li>
<li>We shall admit it, hackers are far better at the security games than security experts. And they just keep getting better.</li>

<h3>Orange France hacked again</h3>
<p>The personal details of 1.3 million Orange users in France have been exposed, just three months after a separate incident affected 800 000 Orange users.</p>
<p>The telecom company has confirmed that last month, on or about April 18, users of its online portal fell victim to a cyber-heist that captured first names, surnames, and sometimes, telephone numbers, dates of birth and email addresses. The hackers were able to get in via a marketing platform that Orange uses to send promotional emails and text messages to opt-in users.</p>
<p>Fortunately, no payment information or credit card numbers were stolen, but Orange has warned its French customers to beware of phishing attempts. Interestingly, according to <em>Le Monde</em>, it has waited until now to make a public admission so that it could patch the exploited flaw.</p>

<h3>63% of Firms say they can’t stop data breaches</h3>
<p>When it comes to cybersecurity, IT departments are deficient, disconnected and in the dark most of the time, according to a new survey. In fact, 63% of them believe that they would be unable to prevent data theft in the event of an attack.

<p>Many Lebanese couples would have wanted to know how their marriage will look like before becoming husband and wife, but it is irregular. An unmarried couple is not even welcomed in a hotel.</p>
<p>The society cannot still understand this phenomenon. Therefore, the girl will be considered as an adulteress regardless of her point of view or her parents’ opinion.</p>
<p><a href="http://lfadi.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/27.jpg"><img src="http://lfadi.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/27.jpg?w=788" alt="2"></a></p>
<p>Not only the old mentality prevent couples from living together, but also does the law. Cohabitation will lead to detention.</p>
<p>The humor here is in the arrest justification. “Sorry people but you were sitting together in a closed room without anyone seeing you which is against morals and may affect ethics”.</p>

<p>Adults above 18 are mature enough to be allowed to live with their partners and preventing them is more like retardation than protection. Cohabitation surely has its cons and many couples may be against it but people should at least have the right of choice.</p>

The company also stated that Google Glass is still in beta and that they want to “move to a more open beta”.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Last week we told you we’d be trying out new ways to find Explorers,” Google wrote on the Google Glass Google+ page. “Well, we weren’t kidding. We learned a lot when we opened our site a few weeks ago, so we’ve decided to move to a more open beta.

<p>Privacy advocates and Google bashers around the world are celebrating the fact that a European court has upheld the “right to be forgotten” principle in a court ruling <a href="http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702303851804579559280623224964?KEYWORDS=%22right+to+be+forgotten%22&mg=reno64-wsj">against Google</a>. This is a major ruling and could have big reverberations around the world, but what does it mean?</p>
<p>I will use a Lebanese example to explain it. Remember Jackie Chamoun (pictured), the Lebanese olympic skier who caused <a href="http://lebaneseblogs.com/?pagewanted=search&s=jackie+chamoun">a storm in Lebanon</a> for a calendar shoot? She’s a potential beneficiary of this ruling.</p>
<p>Let’s say 5 years from now, Jackie Chamoun decides to become a nun, or a sports teacher for little girls in a primary school in Europe. Before making a final decision, the school headmaster decides to do a google search for “jackie chamoun” and finds out about her photo shoot. Is it fair that she may not be hired because of something she did 5 years ago, when she was arguably a completely different person?</p>
<p>The European Union says no. According to the principle of the <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-27394751">“right to be forgotten”</a>, Jackie chamoun can now official ask Google to remove search results relating to her name, and google is forced, by law, to grant her request.</p>
<p>This is a significant ruling, and like I said, it can have reverberations all over the world. But before we all rush to celebrate, we have to remember that the issue is <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2014/05/13/what-you-need-to-know-about-the-eu-high-court-google-ruling/">rather complicated</a> and that there is a flip side to the right to be forgotten: The right to be informed. </p>
<p>Imagine for example our Lebanese politicians who have been warlords and killers in the civil war, decided to clear google search results of all traces to their violent pasts. Will we really be better of for it?</p>

<p>When I first <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/~twitter.com/beirutspring">joined Twitter</a>, I started following everything and everyone who sounded vaguely Lebanese. I also followed back everyone who followed me, as a form of courtesy and protocole. It was at a time when <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/~beirutspring.com/"><em>Beirut Spring</em></a> was about gathering little nuggets of Lebanese news here and there, and I figured at the time that twitter was a great source of offbeat news.</p>
<p>Years have passed and my thinking about twitter has developed, and I think I finally worked out a philosophy for how to use twitter effectively and efficiently. I will share it here even though I know many will find it controversial.</p>
<h3>Who you should <em>not</em> follow on Twitter</h3>
<ul><li><strong>You should not follow people because they are famous.</strong> Some celebrities post mind-numbingly boring and useless stuff. I know one celebrity who posts nothing but “good morning” and “good night” posts. Some just don’t know how to use twitter and their account are just placeholder accounts.</li>
<li><strong>You should not follow friends or family just because you know them.</strong> Some people I really like post the most useless stuff (horoscopes, 4Square check-ins, Paper.li news). We have Facebook for friends, keep Twitter for people who post stuff that are interesting to you.</li>
<li><strong>Don’t follow someone just because they follow you back.</strong> This is tricky and can risk sounding arrogant. But twitter is not about people, it’s about what they post. Some people who follow me post about topics that I don’t care about at all: Football, horoscopes (can you guess my pet peeve?) or cars. Listen, if I follow you and you’re not interested in what I post (Lebanon, politics, coding and coffee), I won’t take it personally if you don’t follow me back, honestly.</li>
<li><strong>Don’t follow news accounts or people who post all the latest news in any topic.</strong> This is useless pollution to your timeline; if a news item is interesting enough, someone will end up retweeting it and you’ll see it.</li>
<li><strong>Avoid <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/~mustapha.me/2014/04/never-ever-use-hashtags-like-this/">hashtag polluters</a></strong>. If I see a tweet with two words and 12 hashtags, I immediately unfollow the person. Hashtags are useful, but they can be abused.</li>
<li><strong>Don’t follow someone because they’re writing about a topic that is hot at the moment:</strong> Egypt is big right now but I won’t go about following every egyptian I find on twitter. A better way is to create an Egypt twitter list and put all these tweeps in it (you don’t have to follow someone to put them in a list).</li>
<li><strong>Don’t follow someone just because they’re attractive.</strong> But that doesn’t mean that you should have a prejudice against good looking people. Some of the most intelligent tweeps I follow are also quite fetching.</li>
</ul><h3>The one reason you <em>should</em> follow someone on Twitter</h3>
<p>If you read the section above carefully, you should have been able to tease out the answer . The only criteria for following someone on twitter is that, more often than not, they post things that are interesting to you. That’s it. It’s not about friendship or niceties, it’s about what people post.</p>
<p>When you want to decide if someone is worth following, go to their profile page and read their last 10 tweets (ignore conversations because they often don’t show up on your timeline), are these interesting to you? Do they post interesting links about topics you care about? Do they have a unique perspective on an issue? Are they funny? Do they write like real people (as opposed to robots)? Are their tweets unique to them?</p>
<p>Be discerning. You can’t possibly enjoy following thousands and thousands of accounts. There’s nothing wrong with following a few hundred of the best accounts. And by best I don’t mean the most famous or the ones with the most followers, but the ones you enjoy reading most. Unfollow liberally and without guilt; unfollowing someone is not the same as unfriending them. If they are upset point them to this post.</p>
<p>I understand that not everyone uses twitter the same. Some use it just to make friends and chat, and there’s nothing wrong with that. But if you want to benefit from what the platform excels at, you may find my advice useful.

<p> </p>
<p><span>A 12 year old kid can now understand that smartphones are not about SPECS!! Clearly Samsung didn’t yet. The Galaxy S5 has impressive features and it is equipped with the most advanced technology. That being said, does it matter for users to have a phone that can launch a spaceship? The Galaxy S5 design is very old and ugly, some people described it as a band aid! What’s the difference between Android based OS phones? Okay, some has more features some has less but it’s the same OS. Some might get late updates or might have a higher camera resolution “though most of them have stranded resolution” but what else? It’s the design and interface of the phone. It’s about the name as well but most of them are similar nowadays “LG, Sony Ericsson, Samsung, or HTC”. The design completes this combination and it can satisfy the customers personal image as he/she prefers. This is the main factor that Apple always use with their standard design. Apple indeed has a standard design but its working! isn’t it? So back to Samsung, yes they are using the latest hardware and features but all in vain. Localytic<span>s</span> estimates that 30% of all Android smartphones sold in the world are part of the Galaxy S series. The current leader is the Samsung Galaxy S3 on 15%. Samsung took the wrong direction and went in putting all their efforts in the software/hardware and left the design for some amatures to handle.  </span><span></span></p>

<br><span>I got quite busy lately but this was actually a good thing as it allowed me more time to tinker with the phone. By tinker I mean use it heavily and not the hack/root/flash sort of tinker (sorry if you are disappointed).</span>
<br><br><span>As I mentioned before the demo unit on display at the launch event took me by surprise and I really wanted to see if the excitement would fade away after I had used the phone for a while.</span>
<br><span>So let me break it down without going into too much of tech speak that you can find floating all over the internet.</span></p>
<h3>What Works</h3>
<ul><li>This is a slim phone, and by slim we are not talking that it’s slim-mer than others. Compared to a usual bic pen, the pen stands slightly higher than it. I believe that Huawei would have wanted to g slimmer if they didn’t want to stick to the standard sized earphone plug.</li>
<li>This is a slick phone. It’s fast and responsive and even if other reviews online have called the Emotion UI laggy I did not experience this lag even while really going at it with a vengeance. I have other issues with the UI but lag was not up there.</li>
<li>The build quality is robust and although you are tempted to treat it gently because it’s so fine and slim it does not have that wiggly feel to it that other much better known brands often display.</li>
<li>The UI offers a lot of intuitive tweaks such as notifications on battery-heavy apps, easy theme customization, a handy unlock screen, DNLA, Gloves Mode and useful management, backup/restore and update features.</li>
<li>The audio quality is very good and most of the musical pieces I tried listening to rendered extremely well is calm and busy environments. On loud outdoors it was expected to struggle a bit but this makes me appreciate a lot the quick sound profile dial-switch that helps one adapt the phone to different environments</li>
<li>The phone comes with its own earphones and a protective cover, something we don’t often see.</li>
<li>The camera worked pretty well. I like to test out the cam in a macro shot and this phone did rather well in my book.</li>
</ul><h3>What Itches</h3>
<ul><li>The grip of the phone is a bit weird, at least compared to the Moto X I’ve been using for a while. I must admit I am a fan of the slightly curved-to-fit shape on some phones. The flat,square, hard edged shape tends to be slightly irritating but overall remains more comfortable than the much heavier Nexus 4 I compared it to.</li>
<li>The keyboard is…an acquired taste. Sure, they tried to revamp things and offer a different feel and functionality but it just doesn’t cut it. 10 days into it and I still have to fight the urge to install swiftkey. I might just do that after I am done writing this post.</li>
<li>No App tray. Yes you heard me as in “no you don’t have all your apps in one place and you can drag a shortcut to the desktop”.  Anything you install goes onto the desktop  and the desktops get created as they fill up. This can be also quite annoying for people using widgets as it gets messy to keep things in order. Luckily folders are supported.</li>
<li>The icons. I am not a big fan of the round icons nor of the colors being used. Compared to the vanilla, Nexus or Google Edition phones they just make the phone feel…hmm…less serious. I think they went for a more familiar feel to people who might be transiting from other OS but iAmNotSure.</li>
<li>No release pin provided for the micro SIM and SC card in the box. At least my unit did not come with one and I know I looked well and carefully.</li>
</ul><p>When I started using this phone I went really after the proverbial “Aha!”. Being the slimmest smartphone ever created and with such a good initial impression, I felt I needed to find the chink in the armor. I was merely able to find some dents and small imperfections that any smartphone craftsman should be able to iron out.</p>
<p>I still wish the phone in came in vanilla Android flavor and hope that its successor would offer that option.
<br>
For those hardcore fans who cannot wait and don’t want the out of the box experience, well you don’t me to tell you what to do.</p>
<p>I might not have given up yet on my current main handset as I sat down writing this post but the P6 has definitely earned its hype and its place as the wing-man for my local and travel usage.
<br>
In short the Ascend P6 is a keeper and definitely an indicator of many good things to come from Huawei.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="http://beirutspring.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/which-one.jpg"><br><span>Decisions decisions</span></p>
<p>When I first <a href="http://twitter.com/beirutspring">joined Twitter</a>, I started following everything and everyone who sounded vaguely Lebanese. I also followed back everyone who followed me, as a form of courtesy and protocole. It was at a time when <a href="http://beirutspring.com/"><em>Beirut Spring</em></a> was about gathering little nuggets of Lebanese news here and there, and I figured at the time that twitter was a great source of offbeat news.</p>
<p>Years have passed and my thinking about twitter has developed, and I think I finally worked out a philosophy for how to use twitter effectively and efficiently. I will share it here even though I know many will find it controversial.</p>
<h2>Who you should <em>not</em> follow on Twitter</h2>
<ul><li><strong>You should not follow people because they are famous.</strong> Some celebrities post mind-numbingly boring and useless stuff. I know one celebrity who posts nothing but “good morning” and “good night” posts. Some just don’t know how to use twitter and their account are just placeholder accounts.</li>
<li><strong>You should not follow friends or family just because you know them.</strong> Some people I really like post the most useless stuff (horoscopes, 4Square check-ins, Paper.li news). We have Facebook for friends, keep Twitter for people who post stuff that are interesting to you.</li>
<li><strong>Don’t follow someone just because they follow you back.</strong> This is tricky and can risk sounding arrogant. But twitter is not about people, it’s about what they post. Some people who follow me post  about topics that I don’t care about at all: Football, horoscopes (can you guess my pet peeve?) or cars. Listen, if I follow you and you’re not interested in what I post (Lebanon,  politics, coding and coffee), I won’t take it personally if you don’t follow me back, honestly.</li>
<li><strong>Don’t follow news accounts or people who post all the latest news in any topic.</strong> This is useless pollution to your timeline; if a news item is interesting enough, someone will end up retweeting it and you’ll see it.</li>
<li><strong>Avoid <a href="http://mustapha.me/2014/04/never-ever-use-hashtags-like-this/">hashtag polluters</a></strong>. If I see a tweet with two words and 12 hashtags, I immediately unfollow the person. Hashtags are useful, but they can be abused.</li>
<li><strong>Don’t follow someone because they’re writing about a topic that is hot at the moment:</strong> Egypt is big right now but I won’t go about following every egyptian I find on twitter. A better way is to create an Egypt twitter list and put all these tweeps in it (you don’t have to follow someone to put them in a list).</li>
<li><strong>Don’t follow someone just because they’re attractive.</strong> But that doesn’t mean that you should have a prejudice against good looking people. Some of the most intelligent tweeps I follow are also quite fetching.</li>
</ul><h2>The one reason you <em>should</em> follow someone on Twitter</h2>
<p>If you read the section above carefully, you should have been able to tease out the answer . The only criteria for following someone on twitter is that, more often than not, they post things that are interesting to you. That’s it. It’s not about friendship or niceties, it’s about what people post.</p>
<p>When you want to decide if someone is worth following, go to their profile page and read their last 10 tweets (ignore conversations because they often don’t show up on your timeline), are these interesting to you? Do they post interesting links about topics you care about? Do they have a unique perspective on an issue? Are they funny? Do they write like real people (as opposed to robots)? Are their tweets unique to them?</p>
<p>Be discerning. You can’t possibly enjoy following thousands and thousands of accounts. There’s nothing wrong with following a few hundred of the best accounts. And by best I don’t mean the most famous or the ones with the most followers, but the ones you enjoy reading most. Unfollow liberally and without guilt; unfollowing someone is not the same as unfriending them. If they are upset point them to this post.</p>
<p>I understand that not everyone uses twitter the same. Some use it just to make friends and chat, and there’s nothing wrong with that. But if you want to benefit from what the platform excels at,  you may find my advice useful. Oh, and if you do think that what I say is interesting, do follow me on <a href="http://twitter.com/beirutspring">twitter</a>.</p>

<p>Since 2011, there has been a pronounced increase in the promulgation of legislation governing the rights of Internet users in the Arab region and in Iran. The laws affect digital rights both directly, through specific mention of online channels in penal codes and press and publications and media laws, as well as indirectly, in anti-terrorism and anti-cybercrime laws. More often than not, the laws are formulated without any input from either technical experts, the private sector, or civil society and are rapidly pushed through without even being released in draft or debated. In addition, the new legislation has also precipitated a corresponding increase in the detention and prosecution of Internet users for exercising their rights to free speech, assembly, and privacy.</p>
<p>As a result, determined advocates are challenging detentions and the passage of bad laws, as well as proactively advocating for better laws related to privacy, data protection, censorship, surveillance, freedom of speech, and Internet infrastructure. As their campaigns evolve, however, organizers are identifying a lack of readily available resources, including the laws themselves, which is affecting their ability to exploit weak points as they design efforts to secure and protect their digital rights and, consequently, sustain the enabling environment they need to conduct more advocacy.</p>
<p>With this precarious situation in mind, this year SMEX—with support from the <a href="http://igmena.org/index.php?p=99">Hivos IGMENA</a> team and researchers in seven countries—aggregated legislation governing digital rights in Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, Tunisia, and Iran. We’ve published this research, meant to be a first step in a longer pursuit of identifying patterns of application and eventually influencing legislation, in an <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/smex.org/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AnWbR3Dqb8t3dGpuT0c5eS1lTHRwR2NXVF9SQWttWFE&usp=drive_web#gid=0">open spreadsheet anyone can access</a> and download. Documents referenced include constitutions, penal codes, laws and their amendments, and executive decrees—often in Arabic and English—and can be sorted by country, year, and type of law. We will continue to update the spreadsheet as part of our ongoing research into the legal framework for online media in the region and greatly appreciate additions and corrections.</p>

<p>This research aims to be a first step in closing the gaps activists are facing in being able to conceptualize the broader legal framework for digital rights in Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, Tunisia, and Iran. (Introduction by Jessica Dheere)</p>
<p>The research comprises two documents:</p>
<ol><li>A country-by-country brief of the legal framework for digital rights (below), and</li>
<li>A related <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/smex.org/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AnWbR3Dqb8t3dGpuT0c5eS1lTHRwR2NXVF9SQWttWFE&usp=drive_web#gid=0">spreadsheet, sortable by country, year, and type of law</a>, that lists the related laws, dates of passage, and links to original-language, and where possible alternative-language (English or French), versions.</li>
</ol><p>we will continue to update the spreadsheet, as we learn about new developments.</p>

By tinker I mean use it heavily and not the hack/root/flash sort of tinker (sorry if you are disappointed).<br><br>As I mentioned before the demo unit on display at the launch event took me by surprise and I really wanted to see if the excitement would fade away after I had used the phone for a while.<br>So let me break it down without going into too much of tech speak that you can find floating all over the internet.<br><br><b>What Works</b><br><br><br><ul><li>This is a slim phone, and by slim we are not talking that it's slim-mer than others. Compared to a usual bic pen, the pen stands slightly higher than it. I believe that Huawei would have wanted to g slimmer if they didn't want to stick to the standard sized earphone plug.<br></li><li>This is a slick phone. It's fast and responsive and even if other reviews online have called the Emotion UI laggy I did not experience this lag even while really going at it with a vengeance. I have other issues with the UI but lag was not up there.<br></li><li>The build quality is robust and although you are tempted to treat it gently because it's so fine and slim it does not have that wiggly feel to it that other much better known brands often display.<br></li><li>The UI offers a lot of intuitive tweaks such as notifications on battery-heavy apps, easy theme customization, a handy unlock screen, DNLA, Gloves Mode and useful management, backup/restore and update features.<br></li><li>The audio quality is very good and most of the musical pieces I tried listening to rendered extremely well is calm and busy environments. On loud outdoors it was expected to struggle a bit but this makes me appreciate a lot the quick sound profile dial-switch that helps one adapt the phone to different environments<br></li><li>The phone comes with its own earphones and a protective cover, something we don't often see.<br></li><li>The camera worked pretty well. I like to test out the cam in a macro shot and this phone did rather well in my book.</li></ul><br><br><b>What Itches</b><br><b><br></b> <br><ul><li>The grip of the phone is a bit weird, at least compared to the Moto X I've been using for a while. I must admit I am a fan of the slightly curved-to-fit shape on some phones. The flat,square, hard edged shape tends to be slightly irritating but overall remains more comfortable than the much heavier Nexus 4 I compared it to.<br></li><li>The keyboard is...an acquired taste. Sure, they tried to revamp things and offer a different feel and functionality but it just doesn't cut it. 10 days into it and I still have to fight the urge to install swiftkey. I might just do that after I am done writing this post.<br></li><li>No App tray. Yes you heard me as in "no you don't have all your apps in one place and you can drag a shortcut to the desktop".  Anything you install goes onto the desktop  and the desktops get created as they fill up. This can be also quite annoying for people using widgets as it gets messy to keep things in order. Luckily folders are supported.<br></li><li>The icons. I am not a big fan of the round icons nor of the colors being used. Compared to the vanilla, Nexus or Google Edition phones they just make the phone feel...hmm...less serious. I think they went for a more familiar feel to people who might be transiting from other OS but iAmNotSure.<br></li><li>No release pin provided for the micro SIM and SC card in the box.

<p>As the Wired story illustrates, Threes was a game that took an entire year of painstaking development with continuous iteration and loving care of little details that gave the game its personality. When it was released, it was only available for iOS and it cost $1.99;</p>
<p>Then something predictable happened: Someone made a free copycat in a couple of afternoons. <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/~https://itunes.apple.com/en/app/2048/id840919914?mt=8"><em>2048</em></a> didn’t have an original idea. It had none of the details and the extra care of <em>Threes</em>, but, crucially it was free and available on Android. Needless to say, <em>2048</em>, the copycat, became much more popular than <em>Threes</em>.</p>
<p>This is a story we have seen on and on: Mac Vs PC, iPhone Vs Android, Instapaper Vs Read it Later (now Pocket)… What is more valuable to us: An original, well executed idea, or a good-enough one that is more accessible? This is a war that will continue to rage, because it often doesn’t result in decisive victories (usually it’s profit vs market share), and I guess it’s more a matter of beliefs and professional ethics of the makers of these products.</p>
<p>Personally, I tried both <em>Threes</em> and <em>2048</em> and I’m sticking with Threes like I stuck with my iPhone and my Mac before it… But I’m not a hopeless case for those who favor universal access: I did switch from <em>Instapaper</em> to <em>Pocket</em> for exactly that reason…</p>
