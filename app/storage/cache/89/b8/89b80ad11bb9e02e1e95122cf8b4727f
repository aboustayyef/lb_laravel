<p><span><strong>It’s simple: you have never seen a movie like <em>Boyhood </em>before, and you likely never will again. Shot over a 12-year period with the same cast, Richard Linklater’s latest is the definition of a masterpiece, and it’s hands down the best movie of the year, and one of the most memorable cinematic experiences you will ever have. </strong></span></p>
<p><span>I’m honestly not even sure how I’m supposed to describe the plot, because it genuinely feels like you’re watching real life unfold before your very eyes. The film’s protagonist, Mason (Ellar Coltane) literally grows up on screen, and we watch him deal with life, one moment at a time. It’s mind-blowingly impressive from a technical perspective, but it’s also extremely real and deceptively simple. Again, it’s like watching real life. I’m just going to leave it at that.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://ageeksblogdotcom1.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/boyhood2.jpg"><img src="http://ageeksblogdotcom1.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/boyhood2.jpg?w=650&h=455" alt="boyhood2"></a></p>
<p><span>For one, director Richard Linklater deserves heaps of praise for this meticulously crafted piece of art. Never in my life have I experienced something like this, and it truly is an <em>experience. </em>The performances he manages to get out of these actors, particularly Ellar Coltrane and Lorelei Linklater (who plays Mason’s sister, Samantha) are incredible. They’ve really matured into solid actors.</span></p>
<p><span>I fell in love with how time progresses in <em>Boyhood. </em>Whether it’s a perfectly timed musical cue, pop culture reference, or a shot of one of the young actors now looking a bit older, it just works. The soundtrack is also brilliant and consists of some of my favorite bands, so that’s also a huge plus.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://ageeksblogdotcom1.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/boyhood-4.png"><img src="http://ageeksblogdotcom1.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/boyhood-4.png?w=650&h=349" alt="Boyhood-4"></a></p>
<p><span>Patricia Arquette and Ethan Hawke are perfect as Mason and Samantha’s parents, and their relationship with their kids is a big part of why this film succeeds. You forget that you’re watching a movie and start believing that they’re their actual parents, which comes as a result of Linklater’s amazing 12-year effort to bring this story to life. </span></p>
<p><span>But the movie is so much more than just a sprawling epic that spans half a decade; it’s an extremely personal tale of a young boy finding himself and learning about life. Mason goes from a wide-eyed five-year-old kid to this pensive, often gloomy teenager, and I for one couldn’t help but relate to him and his struggles. In fact, everyone can relate to some part of his life, which makes this movie so damn resonant.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://ageeksblogdotcom1.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/75.jpg"><img src="http://ageeksblogdotcom1.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/75.jpg?w=650&h=455" alt="75"></a></p>
<p><span><em>Boyhood</em> is also extremely funny, and it feels so effortless thanks to the incredible writing and flawless performances. There’s also some great tension, and whenever you think you know where the story is going, it goes in a completely different direction. The film is almost three hours long, yet not one single scene felt unnecessary or indulgent. In fact, I could have easily sat there for another five hours.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>The Verdict:</strong></span></p>
<p><span><em>Boyhood</em> is one of the greatest cinematic achievements of our generation, but don’t take my word for it, experience it for yourself. You’ll be happy you did. It’s a masterpiece in every sense of the word.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Numerical Score: 10/10</strong></span></p>

The pi&egrave;ce de r&eacute;sistance was without doubt a vigorous, almost rock-like &ldquo;Jawaz al-Safar&rdquo; (&ldquo;Passport&rdquo;), featuring a standing, show-stealing piano solo from Marcel&rsquo;s son, Rami, that had a woman of no fewer than 70 years dancing like a teenager up and down one of the aisles.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A couple of veteran Marcel fans felt there were one or two more guest solo singers than was perhaps necessary (I counted four).

It took about a couple of hours before the new Airbnb logo would become the ridicule of the design community - much has been read into it: A phallic symobl, check, a widened vagina, check, boobs, check, and the list goes. The fact that is resembles closely two other logos (N3twork and Automation Anywhere) does not help.<br>
Note that this is not the first time a new logo gets a desatrous welcome - Gap suffered major backlash upon releasing theirs, heck, the whole country of Poland also had to retract a new redesigned logo, and (lest we forget) the <a href="http://beirutntsc.blogspot.com/2011/03/are-we-getting-too-carried-away.html">Saudi Arilines</a>.<br>
