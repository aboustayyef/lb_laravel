Iraq today has reached a momentous moment of reckoning for the weaknesses of modern Arab statehood and governance. External factors certainly played their roles, such as the Anglo-American war on  Iraq in 2003, decades of Israeli meddling in Arab conditions, and Iran’s growing influence in the region. </p><p>These external factors, however, could only impact on conditions in  Iraq because of the underlying structural problems whose consequences are now playing out before us every day. These underlying Arab-made structural problems include corrupt and incompetent governance, weak citizenship, brittle statehood, and a severe lack of cohesion among different ethnic and sectarian groups within countries.</p><p>The news that many locals have not resisted, and even often welcomed, the arrival of ISIS should clarify the intense problems that existed between the government and mostly Sunni local communities in northwest Iraq. Air attacks by the Iraqi government or military moves by foreign powers such as Iran  or the United States will momentarily delay the expansion of ISIS-controlled areas. But military power in the long run remains helpless in the face of determined moves by disgruntled citizens to regain what they see as dignity, freedom and rights.</p><p>The best proof of this is the steady expansion in the numbers and capabilities of extremist Salafist-takfiri militant groups such as Al-Qaeda, ISIS, the Nusra Front  and dozens of other groups that have been repeatedly targeted by military strikes by local governments and the American armed forces. So, military attacks against ISIS and its local allies in  Iraq would momentarily pause the current trajectory of the group’s expansion, but will not stop it in the long run. </p><p>The fact that some Iraqis would consider life under the draconian rules of ISIS preferable to the conditions they had endured under previous elected Iraqi governments shows how severe are the grievances of ordinary citizens under the rule of Arab tyrants. Most disgruntled Arab citizens would not join groups such as ISIS or Al-Qaeda, but rather would seek reforms of their mismanaged states through gradual change, or the revolution some of them experienced in the last three years. </p><p>So the only lasting antidote to the problems we are witnessing in  Syria and Iraq, and in less intense forms in Bahrain, Libya, Egypt and Yemen, requires many years to take shape. That antidote is more democratic and inclusive government coupled with growing economies. Even just one of these two imperatives would give citizens the sense of hope that they and their children might enjoy a better future. </p><p>When citizens suffer both police state-style governments with stagnant economies that mostly favor a small number of families close to the ruling regimes, we end up with situations like the ones in  Syria and Iraq. Citizens who have grown frustrated because of their mistreatment by their own governments desperately turn to groups such as ISIS to give them an alternative lifestyle. There can be no greater indictment than that of the sickness, criminality and rot that have defined most Arab governance systems in recent decades. </p><p>Making the transition from this desperate condition to a more democratic and economically developing society takes a long time. But ordinary Arab citizens who pay the price today – including millions of refugees, such as the half-million who fled the city of  Mosul in two days earlier this week – have no practical options but to keep exploring ways of transforming their failing autocratic systems into more coherent and satisfying ones that are based on participation, pluralism and accountability. </p><p>The rapid expansion of ISIS in  Iraq is not a sign of the future, because these extremists have no base of support in the region. They only gain territory by force and in conditions of chaos. In more normal conditions, they have never had any serious support in Arab countries.</p><p>ISIS is frightening, to be sure, but not because it portends our future; it is frightening because it reminds us of the criminal incompetence of ruling Arab regimes during the past half-century, and as such it clarifies what must be done to bring Arab societies back to some semblance of normal life. This will be a long and hard struggle, but we have no other options.</p><p>Rami G. Khouri  is published twice weekly by THE DAILY STAR.

When Al-Mawarid Bank and local startup Presella jointly announced the bank’s equity participation in the company yesterday, it had been almost a year since Banque du Liban (BDL) created the funding mechanism that would support this type of deal. Mawarid’s investment in Presella was the first to be approved by the central bank under this system, whereby the company will be receiving $200,000 from the bank for an equity stake of just under 21 percent. This suggests the shareholders value the company at around $1 million.</p>
<p>The key element behind the deal is <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.executive-magazine.com%2Fbusiness-finance%2Fbusiness%2Fin-need-of-nurture&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNG6Kyyogca13hc2OqGDuuJTXCxhBA" target="_blank">Circular 331</a>, which was passed by the central bank in August of last year. Under this circular, the central bank subsidizes 75 percent of an equity investment by commercial banks into a startup company under an arrangement that allows commercial banks to buy treasury bills and sell them back to the central bank at a discounted rate.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fpresella.com%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNGkH_YB0fkJqBL6NambeiQoKx_xTQ" target="_blank">Presella</a> is an online ticketing platform that seeks to help event organizers reduce the financial risk of throwing events. The company offers normal services such as selling tickets, but also has a crowdfunding option whereby anyone organizing an event can set the minimum number of tickets that need to be sold for the event to take place. In about one and a half years, the startup has sold over $650,000 worth of tickets between hundreds of small and medium sized events, primarily in Beirut, followed by rollouts in Dubai and events in Cyprus and Turkey.</p>
<p><strong>Start from the bottom</strong></p>
<p>The company has certainly grown since its 2012 debut. Presella was one of the eight startups that graduated from <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.executive-magazine.com%2Fbusiness-finance%2Fbusiness%2Fmoney-for-ideas&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNHEBqT_Q-NKTV_zQrhWjgUlhflUbg" target="_blank">former acceleration program Seeqnce</a>, which provided its first round of funding of $76,500, split between cash and in-kind services such as office space and an internet connection.</p>
<p>It was through a pitching session held by Seeqnce in 2013 that Presella first caught the eye of <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.executive-magazine.com%2Fbusiness-finance%2Fbusiness%2Fmarwan-kheireddine-investing-in-local-startups&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNGSuRQ0CzbMZZg5fOwGDUYX10fNCQ" target="_blank">Marwan Kheireddine</a>, chair and general manager of Mawarid, major shareholder in Virgin Megastore in Lebanon and Saudi Arabia, and a former minister in the 2011–2014 government of Najib Mikati. Kheireddine had been invited to the pitching event as an angel investor. Earmarking them for investment, Kheireddine pushed forward when Circular 331 was promulgated.</p>
<p>Mawarid’s investment is part of Presella’s $300,000 second round of funding. In addition to the bank’s $200,000, the startup will receive $100,000 from a handful of Lebanese angel investors. The company plans on using the money to expand in the Emirati, Qatari and Saudi markets. “We are aiming to be a success story, to inspire entrepreneurs in Lebanon,” says cofounder Walid Singer.</p>
<p>The current shareholders include cofounders Singer and Louay Kadri, as well as a group shareholding that originated in the Seeqnce accelerator program. After the second funding round, Presella’s shareholders will include six new members, says Singer.</p>
<p>And Mawarid is letting them drive. The bank will take a board seat, but they will not engage with them as advisors, according to Kheireddine. “Being a bank on their board gives them credibility wherever they go, so we can open doors for them,” he says. “It is a relatively well structured board. Had we gone into another investment that was really brand new, right off the drawing board, the chances are we would position ourselves to play a bigger role in that company.”</p>
<p>According to Kheireddine, Mawarid is planning on exiting the company in five years, although the circular gives them up to seven years.</p>
<p><strong>Blazing the trail</strong></p>
<p>When Circular 331 was passed, it generated a lot of hype over the maximum of approximately $400 million that could be injected into the startup economy. But while the rate of investment has not been promising thus far, such deals may see an uptick now that the first bank has taken the plunge.</p>
<p>The central bank is currently looking through the documents of a total of five startups, but is aware of approximately 25–30 more in the process of applying, according to Marianne Hoayek, head of the Executive Office at BDL.</p>
<p>A handful of banks are actively looking for deals to invest in. For his part, Kheireddine plans to have Mawarid invest in at least 30 companies. The bank is in the process of looking at three other investments, one of which it has already applied to the central bank for, according to Kheireddine.</p>
<p>As far as diversification goes, Mawarid can invest up to $3 million into startup companies, according to the terms of the circular which limit the amount of investment a bank can make into startup companies to 3 percent of a bank’s tier 1 capital. In Mawarid’s case, this capital stands at around $100 million, according to the chair. It is also limited to investments of $300,000 or less, since the circular defines that a bank can only invest a tenth of the 3 percent into any one company.</p>
<p>While it is difficult to project how many startups will see investment over the next couple of years, Kheireddine was adamant that conservative banks in Lebanon need to change their culture in terms of how they perceive startups and begin to understand how to invest in them (see <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.executive-magazine.com%2Fbusiness-finance%2Fbusiness%2Fmarwan-kheireddine-investing-in-local-startups&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNGSuRQ0CzbMZZg5fOwGDUYX10fNCQ" target="_blank">Q&A with Marwan Kheireddine</a>).</p>
<p>Mawarid’s investment certainly creates a stronger potential for other banks to follow suit, now that a precedent is set. “We knew that Circular 331 had to be ironed out,” says Kheireddine. “There were a lot of things that needed clarification internally within the central bank and within each bank. So we went through that first investment with the intention of paving the way for other investments to come.”</p>
<p>To apply for central bank funding, the startup and the commercial bank have to sign a term sheet, which is sent to the central bank along with other documentation such as the business plan. The central bank makes sure that the company is compliant with Circular 331, and then advances 75 percent of the funds through the treasury bill mechanism while the bank comes up with the other 25 percent.</p>
<p>If the investment is profitable, the commercial bank has to split gains from dividends or the sale of the shares 50–50 with the central bank.</p>
<p>“Success will come; the question is whether it’s going to be huge or small,” says Kheireddine. “I think that we will end up investing in at least a few hundred companies, utilizing a few million dollars of the $400 million, and making some money on some of the companies. But that’s the least that I would like to see.”</p>

He was involved in pushing <a href="http://www.bdl.gov.lb/circulars/intermediary/5/37/0/Intermediate-Circulars.html" target="_blank">Circular 331</a> in coordination with former Minister of Telecommunications Nicolas Sehnaoui. Executive sat with him to talk about Mawarid’s recent investment in local startup Presella.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>So are you Presella’s number one fan?</strong></p>
<p>Does it really matter? I don’t think so. What is important is that they get to work, and prove that their business plan is achievable, and that they can create jobs and make returns.</p>
<p> </p>
<div><p>I think that at most we will be financing semi-crazy ideas.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>You actually have some entrepreneurial and investment experience. Are you nervous that other banks who are directly investing into startups don’t have this kind of knowledge?</strong></p>
<p>No, I think that the challenge banks will have, which we will also have as a bank, is changing their mentality from lenders to investors. Because the two things are totally different. When you lend someone money, you’re lending them with the intention and you’re taking all the required precautions to ensure that they will pay you back the principal amount that they borrowed plus all interest and charges and what have you. Now if you are investing, you’re taking a totally different approach, you’re looking at the business model, you’re looking at the management capabilities, you’re looking at the opportunity of success. But then you may lose money. And bankers are not designed — their DNA does not really work well with losing money. So there is a culture shift that needs to take place in banks in order to move them from great lenders and knowing exactly how to lend, to great investors and thinking how to invest.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>But even with a culture shift, isn’t this a very risky venture for banks who have no past experience in investing, and who are notoriously conservative?</strong></p>
<p>I honestly think that not all banks are going to take this opportunity. It was very wise by the central bank to force banks to provide 25 percent [of any investment]. Because had this not been there, the market would have probably seen a lot of lousy investments. But the fact that banks have to put up 25 percent of any investment from their own money, means basically that there is not going to be an investment that is not well analyzed and not well looked at. So that will protect the system, basically.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Do you thinks banks will look into these ventures as genuine profit making opportunities or do you think it’s going to start more as a corporate social responsibility (CSR) policy by banks who want to show that they’re dynamic players in the ecosystem?</strong></p>
<p>I think a few banks will use that as a CSR initiative. And you know what? That’s fine. Big deal. At the end of the day, they are taking a risk in investing in companies. They are going to lose 25 percent of their investment if they choose badly, and if they don’t do enough investments as a policy, the chances of them losing all their investment is huge.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Isn’t it also risky for the central bank?</strong></p>
<p>When the central bank [decided] this, we assumed 1 out of 10, or 1 out of 15 [startups] would make it.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Aren’t these figures a global rule of thumb? How do we know if it will apply to Lebanon?</strong></p>
<p>We don’t know. But I think we will perform slightly better than the average international performance, mostly because the investment decision will be taken by banks that are conservative in nature. So in my mind, we’re not going to be financing crazy ideas. I think that at most we will be financing semi-crazy ideas.</p>
<p>But if you end up investing in a few thousand companies, by sheer application of the statistics, the central bank should be benefiting. I think Armageddon for all of us is if we only invest in a few companies, and then don’t find anything else. Then the chances are we are losing all of our investments — but then it’s not the 400 million, it’s a very small amount. So statistically speaking, the probability of success should be higher than what we have seen internationally, only because banks are more conservative in their decisionmaking. Irrespective of how entrepreneurial you are going to push them to be, they will still be conservative.</p>

ISIS is a vanguard, to which various Sunni-dominated groups, including onetime Baathists, have attached themselves, all fighting the Shiite-dominated government of Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If so, this can tell us a great deal about the pitfalls of Iran&rsquo;s approach to the Arab world, particularly its seeming refusal to push for conciliation with Sunnis in Iraq or Syria.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>For years, Maliki has embarked on a reckless path of marginalizing Iraqi Sunnis, generating the rancor that has greatly facilitated the ISIS campaign. Maliki began by alienating the Sunni Arab Awakening that American forces had put in place in Anbar province to fight Al-Qaeda in Iraq. He then had an arrest warrant issued against Tareq al-Hashemi, the deputy prime minister and most senior Sunni official, who later fled Iraq. And finally, Maliki used force to break up a months-long protest in Anbar where Sunnis had gathered to denounce the government&rsquo;s mistreatment of their community.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Iran, which has considerable influence over Iraq, and over Maliki in particular, apparently did nothing to dissuade him from pursuing his Shiite-centric policies. Today it is paying the price, with reports suggesting that Qassem Soleimani, the head of the Quds Force in Iran&rsquo;s Revolutionary Guard and someone often described, rightly or wrongly, as Iran&rsquo;s proconsul in Iraq, is feverishly working to contain the debacle.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Iran&rsquo;s strategy in the Arab world is, to a great extent, based precisely on the type of behavior that led to catastrophe in Iraq. In Iraq and Syria in the past three years, where their allies have not had a realistic chance of co-opting enraged Sunni communities, Iran has encouraged fragmentation. It has done so on the assumption that the Islamic Republic is better able to exert its influence in divided, conflictual Arab societies than in ones that are unified and can stand up to Iranian hegemony.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In Iraq, this has meant that Iran accepts Maliki&rsquo;s divisive policies and supports him in his sectarian standoffs. In Syria, it has led to the consolidation of President Bashar al-Assad&rsquo;s control over Damascus, the border area with Lebanon, the Syrian coast, and communication lines in between. Outside those areas the regime and Iran haven&rsquo;t the manpower or the wherewithal to recapture and hold territory. This essentially means Iran has helped harden Syria&rsquo;s sectarian partition lines.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In Lebanon the situation is somewhat different. Because its Hezbollah allies have been able to play a dominant role in the institutions of the Lebanese state, Iran has not sought fragmentation. Instead, Hezbollah has resorted to the language and practice of consensus, backed by the occasional threat or use of violence, in such a way as to neutralize its adversaries.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Everywhere, Iranian behavior is based on a careful reading of the balance of forces &ndash; of what Iran&rsquo;s allies can impose on those who disagree with them, no matter how contentious. Almost nowhere (Lebanon sometimes being an exception, due to its complicated sectarian makeup and Hezbollah&rsquo;s need to preserve key political alliances) has there been a sustained effort by Iranian-backed officials or parties to engage in the politics of compromise with disgruntled Sunni communities.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We are now witnessing a counter-reaction to this inflexible approach in Iraq, while in Syria Assad&rsquo;s policies have virtually ensured that he may never rule over a united country again. Arab divisions may benefit Iran, but that&rsquo;s assuming the Islamic Republic can indefinitely contain the potentially devastating consequences of the policies it abets, which is not guaranteed.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The problem with the Iranian strategy is that its reliance on &ldquo;creative Arab chaos&rdquo; makes it difficult for Tehran to build something durable through its alliances. And yet, historically, Iran is a nation of institutions, and has succeeded remarkably in some cases &ndash; for example in its creation of Hezbollah in Lebanon. But in Syria and Iraq, its partners have been brutal or irresponsible abusers of institutions, emptying them of their meaning and turning them into bulwarks of personal power.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The Iranians must think long and hard about the Iraqi lesson. ISIS is simply a symptom of the fire spreading through the drywood of Sunni regional discontent. That&rsquo;s why Tehran may have no choice but to consider a different approach to the region&rsquo;s Sunnis, or face sectarian blowback everywhere.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Potentially, this realization can open valuable doors for cooperation with Saudi Arabia, especially as both have an interest in defeating ISIS. However, it may also require an overhaul of Iranian thinking on the Arab world, as well as a modest understanding that power plays in the region cannot long succeed when directed against the Sunni majority.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The collapse in Iraq has been a setback for the United States, which spent a trillion dollars on the country, lost thousands of lives, and trained Iraq&rsquo;s army. But it is, above all, a reversal for Iran, whose ally Nouri al-Maliki pushed the Sunnis over the edge, which now threatens Iran&rsquo;s vital interests. To calm the furies, Tehran will have to reexamine its methods, and decide whether sectarian brinksmanship is the way to keep going.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Michael Young is opinion editor of The Daily Star newspaper.

<p>Answers to this question circulated across social circles and media platforms, compounded by speculation on whether the national television station Tele Liban will be airing the games or not, to such an extent that many hospitality venue owners and everyday people are waiting until the last possible minute to commit to a subscription model while many home viewers are still confused as to how they can watch the World Cup.</p>
<p>The short and simple answer is that the World Cup can be watched through beIN Sports, previously known as Al Jazeera Sports, which purchased the distribution and exclusive broadcasting rights from world football body FIFA for the MENA region in 2009.</p>
<p>The channel also bought the rights to broadcast other sporting events such as Formula 1 races, European football championships and US basketball games, to only cite a few, making it a one-stop provider for sports fans.</p>
<p><strong>Fighting pirated feeds</strong></p>
<p>Such a bouquet of sporting events does not come cheap — beIN <a href="http://www.thenational.ae/business/media/al-jazeera-wins-middle-east-tv-rights-to-world-cups" target="_blank">reportedly spent $1 billion</a> for a package of sports content rights, including the 2010 and 2014 World Cups, an investment that it wants to ensure pays off. In Lebanon, this could prove especially challenging given the high rate of unlicensed cable feeds. For months now, the company has been attempting to catalog legitimate users, asking them to register their smart card’s ID number and receiver number on the beIN website, thereby linking them together and identifying their owner. Registration is only allowed for particular receivers and card models; if the receiver is not on the approved list — and only two models are — then the subscriber must purchase another beIN-secured receiver. Otherwise, the beIN feed is cut off.</p>
<p>This move is one that the company has been implementing to control pirated viewing. Since June 1, 2014, all receivers and smart cards that are not registered have their access to beIN channels blocked. This has made the flood of unlicensed and unencrypted receivers unusable to directly watch the brand’s channels. Also, since each receiver is linked to one smart card, the chances for splitting the cable have been lowered. To sweeten the deal for paying subscribers, beIN made PC and mobile viewing possible through the brand’s website by providing one’s unique smart card number.</p>
<p>The efforts seem to be bearing results: even some neighborhood cable distributors — who usually find ways around such technological measures — say the only way to watch the games this year is through a secured receiver.</p>
<p><strong>Then, how to watch the games?</strong></p>
<p>In Lebanon, one can so far get beIN Sports through two main dealers, according to the brand’s website: MK Electronics-Echosat, which has the distribution rights for both home and commercial viewing by satellite through beIN receivers, and Sama, which has the same rights in addition to rebroadcasting by land and by Internet Protocol Television.</p>
<p>Both main dealers refuse to disclose the exact amount they paid beIN for rights, but Hassan Zein, the Executive Director of Sama, says it is in the hundreds of thousands of dollars. The two dealers say beIN invested into and shared with them the technology to block or detect pirated viewing. They also claimed that they would take legal action against anyone who shows the games by unlicensed means.</p>
<p>So what of the numerous other providers? Mohamad Al Khatib, CEO of MK Group, explains that the remaining 36 dealers listed on <a href="http://www.en.beinsports.net/dealers" target="_blank">beIN’s website</a> for Lebanon are subdealers for either Sama or MK Electronics, selling the pair’s satellite receivers and smart cards in exchange for a percentage of the profits. “It is good for us because it allows us to be close to and cover all areas of Lebanon since some clients might not want to come all the way to our offices in Beirut just to [be able to watch the] World Cup,” says Khatib.</p>
<p>MK Electronics offers World Cup home viewing through beIN secure direct satellite receivers which they broadcast across three satellites: Qatari Es’hailSat, Egyptian Nilesat and Saudi Arabsat. This costs $46 for the receiver and $130 for a three month subscription.</p>
<p>Sama broadcasts the World Cup for home viewing through cable to a beIN receiver, which Zein says they’re asking subdealers to loan, free of charge, to their trusted clients during the World Cup month, and a smart card that costs $110 per month.</p>
<p>So it is left up to the viewer to decide if they want to choose MK Electronics and pay around $50 dollars extra for a longer viewing period — which would then include replays and summaries as well as whatever else is going on in the world of sports until their three month subscriptions ends in August — or opt for the one month option of Sama which will stop directly at the end of the World Cup.</p>
<p>While these prices may seem reasonable to some, many Lebanese simply cannot afford to pay extra fees to enjoy the football matches — not to mention additional fees piled on by some subdealers. This is why Tele Liban is attempting to secure last minute broadcasting rights from beIN so it may then air the games for free on its channel. As this article went to publication, the outcome was still uncertain, though hopes for a last minute surprise were still alive with the Qatari Prime Minister promising Lebanon’s Interior Minister he will help secure the rights for TL.</p>
<p><strong>A different deal for venues</strong></p>
<p>Even if TL does manage to show the games for free, hospitality venues such as cafés and bars are bound by an annual commercial viewing contract and cannot broadcast from TL or from cable. Khatib, who has the rights to sell commercial viewing, explains that the criteria for pricing differs for each venue and is based on guidelines set by beIN, which has the final decision in setting the price. The contract is signed directly with beIN — which gets the majority of the profits.</p>
<p>The criteria used to price commercial viewing are: venue category, determined by the number of stars of hotels or the quality and pricing of restaurants; venue location — whether it’s in a high traffic area or not; the venue’s seating capacity; and whether it is part of a restaurant chain or not. Annual subscriptions for commercial viewing cost from $3,000 to $20,000 per year, according to Khatib.</p>
<p>For Lebanese unwilling to shell out the cash to watch the games at home, hopes will be pinned on local venues showing the matches to crowds of football loving customers. And after all, isn’t the World Cup about bring people together?</p>

<p>In reality, all this is merely a Lebanese way of preparing for the World Cup and showing support for people’s favorite teams. The fact that the national team has never qualified for the World Cup does not appear to have affected people’s enthusiasm for the event, instead bolstering their loyalty to other popular teams. This loyalty is widely demonstrated during each international event through the display of some country’s flag, and the bigger the better.</p>
<p><strong>Nationalism and internationalism</strong></p>
<p>So where do these flags come from? Lebanese wholesalers of Chinese manufactured seasonal novelty games and gift items begin ordering flags directly from China at least four months in advance to ensure timely delivery, according to Hanna Daouk of Khalil Ismail Establishment, a Lebanese wholesaler that was commonly cited among the shop owners Executive spoke to.</p>
<p>Many of the smaller traders buy their flags from such wholesalers and resell them at a higher price to make a profit. Aside from Khalil Ismail Establishment, Safawi Establishment and Hannoun were other frequently mentioned names. “We order around two large crates of flags, so we have approximately a hundred flags for each country we order, aside from the various gadgets, and we manage to sell all our stock to various shop owners in Lebanon,” says Daouk.</p>
<p>Wholesalers and smaller vendors alike are careful to invest mainly in the most popular countries in Lebanon or the ones with the strongest teams, lest they be left with too many unsold flags. “In general, we finish our stocks of Brazil and Germany’s flags first as they are the most popular teams in Lebanon. Next come the Italian and Argentine flags, and we don’t even bother getting the other flags,” says Zaynab El Hassan, manager of the toys purchasing section at Karout Grand Stores. She adds that with experience, they can now get almost the exact number of flags they need — around a hundred for each of the main countries — and not be left with any surplus.</p>
<p>Vendors are also careful not to invest in too many flags in case a team experiences an unexpected loss from the onset of the world cup and the rest goes into stock until the next international event. “You have to know football and make your calculations when you are buying flags or you will not make up for what you spent,” says Ramzi Aswad, an automobile accessories shop owner who also sells flags and novelty items during the World Cup season.</p>
<p>Despite their best efforts, most vendors end up with leftover flags after the championship, an outcome which most don’t mind as they say they can always resell them during the next World Cup or any international sporting event as “flags don’t change,” says Aswad. </p><div><a href="http://www.executive-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Flags-1.jpg"><img src="http://www.executive-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Flags-1.jpg" alt="World Cup flags" width="580" height="386"></a><span><a href="http://www.executive-magazine.com/author/greg-demarque">Greg Demarque</a> | Executive</span></div>
<p><strong>Competition around a competition</strong></p>
<p>Still, the desire to sell the biggest amount possible leads to an ‘early bird gets the worm’ situation with shop windows displaying all varieties of flags and memorabilia about a month and a half before the World Cup. “You have to be the first in your neighborhood to show your flags because people buy them only once in the season … and also because your display will then stick to their minds when they decide to buy a flag later on,” explains Saleh Jummaa, an owner of a grocery shop in Qoreitem which sells flags year-round but only promotes them during international events.</p>
<p>Flag prices vary according to the size and the country. The flags of the more widely available countries are sold at a lower price. In general, prices range from a dollar for a 50 centimeter flag from a street vendor up to $50 for a 3 meter German flag.</p>
<p>Fans of uncommonly supported countries such as Ghana or Uruguay will have to dish out extra cash and put more effort into finding the flag of the country they support. Jummaa, who has flags of all participating countries, explains he sells a meter long flag of Uruguay for $6 while he would sell the same sized flag of Brazil for half the price. “It is rare so of course it is more expensive,” he says, adding that he can custom make any flag requested for an extra charge.</p>
<p>Luckily for Lebanese optimists, the cedar flag should be in plentiful supply for years to come.</p>

With ISIS controlling the Syria- Iraq border, able to shift its men between either country, and living off oil resources in Syria, we are seeing the consolidation of a territory controlled by no state, one that may prove far more destabilizing than Afghanistan  after Osama bin Laden moved there from Sudan. </p><p>In a speech at West Point  in May, President Barack Obama  observed, “For the foreseeable future, the most direct threat to America, at home and abroad, remains terrorism, but a strategy that involves invading every country that harbors terrorist networks is naïve and unsustainable.”</p><p>No one disagrees with the straw man Obama set up. Yet the president must admit one thing: Any solution to the ISIS problem must come from both  Iraq and Syria. Obama is learning why a Syrian conflict he once recklessly qualified as “someone else’s civil war” has turned into a regional danger. </p><p>As the former U.S. envoy in Syria, Robert Ford, wrote this week in the New York Times, “We don’t have good choices on  Syria anymore. But some are clearly worse than others. More hesitation and unwillingness to commit to enabling the moderate opposition fighters to fight more effectively both the jihadists and the regime simply hasten the day when American forces will have to intervene against Al-Qaeda  in Syria.”</p><p>Ford is right. The Obama administration’s staying out of  Syria at all costs has effectively meant it allowed a situation to fester that may impose its intervention at a later stage. It’s funny how the lessons of the West’s abandonment of  Afghanistan after the Soviet withdrawal were ignored. This led to the consolidation of an unruly territory that allowed the perpetrators of 9/11 to plot their crime. But in Obama’s Washington memories are short, while the refusal to consider intervention is rarely measured against the negative consequences of such a choice. </p><p>At West Point, Obama also declared: “I believe we must shift our counterterrorism strategy, drawing on the successes and shortcomings of our experience in  Iraq and Afghanistan, to more effectively partner with countries where terrorist networks seek a foothold.” Indeed, but what is the president’s plan in Iraq, a country which he has largely ignored in the past five years, despite the high cost in American lives and money?</p><p>And what are Obama’s intentions in Syria? There are reports that the U.S. intends to train Syrian rebels, apparently to fight  Al-Qaeda groups as well as President Bashar Assad’s regime. According to David Ignatius, writing on this page, the plan is to train some 9,600 rebels by the end of this year. </p><p>The only problem is that it remains unclear how realistic are American aims. If the goal is to transform Syria’s rebels into an American proxy to fight ISIS and the Nusra Front, the brains in Washington may quickly realize that the Syrians have other priorities. Their aim is, above all, to overthrow the Syrian regime, whereas the Obama administration still clings to a policy of forcing Assad to the negotiating table. This implicitly means denying the rebels an opportunity to defeat him. </p><p>Assad knows this all too well. His regime initially gave ISIS the leeway and leverage it needed to expand, knowing full well that this would so agitate Western states that they would hesitate to arm and assist the Syrian rebels. And yet Obama still refuses to dislodge a Syrian regime that will continue to defend itself by exporting instability through groups such as ISIS.</p><p>Unless the U.S. devises a strategy that encompasses both  Iraq and Syria, and that addresses the complex, multifaceted nature of the Syrian and Iraqi crises, failure is probable. This is a test for Obama, one that will have a bearing on his commitments elsewhere, above all in Afghanistan. It will also be a test for ties with Iran on the region. While obstacles to a nuclear deal remain, when it comes to Iraq, the U.S. and the Islamic Republic appear to be, objectively at least, on the same side. </p><p>The problem is that the Obama administration always seems to be the last to pick up on dynamics in the Arab world. The ISIS challenge is a complicated one, involving several regional states and feeding off intricate, contending domestic ambitions inside  Iraq and Syria. This is not a headache that Obama can resolve with his usual urbane detachment. He has made fighting terrorism a priority, and combating ISIS will involve a political and military commitment, even without deploying U.S. forces, that will have to be measured in years not months.</p><p>During his election campaign, Obama claimed that  Al-Qaeda had been “decimated” under his watch. What is intriguing about ISIS is not so much that it has proven Obama’s statement wrong; it’s that its leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, seems to be challenging Al-Qaeda’s Ayman al-Zawahri for the top spot. The ISIS push into  Mosul was as much part of an internal struggle over leadership of the jihadist international as anything else.</p><p>By taking over Mosul, ISIS may have compelled the United States  to overhaul its  Syria policy. But nothing in Obama’s record makes us hopeful about his reaction.  Iraq and  Syria require American time and effort, which the president has been consistently unwilling to give the Middle East. The only bitter satisfaction is that a region he arrogantly thought he could ignore has just bitten a big chunk out of his leg. </p><p>Michael Young is opinion editor of THE DAILY STAR.

By and large, Western states have defended the status quo in the Arab world, even urging their Kurdish allies to remain a part of an Iraqi federal state.</p><p>Only in the Israeli-Palestinian context has there been a project to create a new Palestinian state, while the establishment of South Sudan in 2011 merely formalised a longstanding rift between Khartoum and Sudan&#x2019;s south.</p><p>The fear of fragmentation in the region derives from an understanding not that its states were created by Western colonial powers, but from the fact that they have become more contested by their own citizens. This has been true of Syria, Iraq, Libya and even Lebanon, which yet remained one country despite a terrible civil war.</p><p>This dysfunctional nature of the Arab state is the consequence mainly of social contracts that promise citizens only intimidation and repression, usually under the eye of a brutal ruling class, with little by way of rights or economic and human development.</p><p>Syria has been a prime example of this pattern. Other than the prospect of ending the violence, little encourages Syrians to return to the sordid state in place before 2011. At the same time, the incentive to see Syria divided into mini-states, constructed around sectarian or ethnic identities, is no stronger. Both sides in the conflict seek to defeat the other and win all of Syria.</p><p>But is that true of everyone? President Bashar Al Assad&#x2019;s staunchest ally, Iran, appears to have a different agenda, at least in the medium term: to consolidate the Syrian regime&#x2019;s hold over &#x201c;vital Syria&#x201d; &#x2013; Damascus, the border with Lebanon, the Syrian coast, and communication lines in between, through the city and province of Homs. Outside those areas, Iran has neither the manpower nor the incentive to help Mr Al Assad recapture territory and hold it for an extended period.</p><p>The implications are very serious. Unable to impose its allies&#x2019; control over large swathes of Sunni-dominated areas in Syria and Iraq, a hegemonic Tehran may prefer fragmentation, allowing it to dominate digestible components of disintegrating Arab states.</p><p>Nor can Mr Al Assad challenge this, given his dependency on Iran and its Lebanese and Iraqi Shia clients for his own political survival. But whether Syria&#x2019;s divided territories consolidate into lasting entities is a question that remains unresolved.</p><p>The possibility of a parting of the ways between Mr Al Assad and Iran is improbable, but possible. The Syrian president has not sought to build up an Alawite mini-state in northeast Syria, while he has done his utmost to maintain a grip on &#xad;Damascus.</p><p>Perhaps he feels that a resort to a blatantly sectarian project would not only undermine the idea of Al Assad rule over all of Syria, it could destroy the family&#x2019;s standing among Alawites. In the past half-century the story of the Alawites has been one of expansion outside their traditional areas and integration into the Syrian state. To be forced back into the mountain now could prompt them to turn against Mr Al Assad&#x2019;s rule.</p><p>The Syrian state as we knew it is not likely to return in the foreseeable future, if ever. But if anything helps achieve this it&#x2019;s the efforts of regional powers to accelerate the breakup of Syria &#x2013; or Iraq, for that matter &#x2013; in order to better exploit the aftermath.</p><p>Colonial-era borders in the Arab world have proven far more resilient than critics of colonialism will admit. But post-colonial Arab regimes, by presiding over failing states, have made the task that much easier for countries gaining from their divisions.</p><p>Michael Young is opinion editor of The Daily Star newspaper in Beirut.</p><p>On Twitter @BeirutCalling </p>";s:17:"post_image_height";i:0;s:16:"post_image_width";i:0;s:11:"post_visits";i:9;s:18:"post_twitterShares";i:26;s:19:"post_facebookShares";i:41;s:16:"post_totalShares";i:67;s:16:"post_socialScore";i:26;s:13:"post_virality";i:34;s:9:"blog_name";N;s:16:"blog_description";N;s:8:"blog_url";N;s:11:"blog_author";N;s:28:"blog_author_twitter_username";N;s:13:"blog_rss_feed";N;s:9:"blog_tags";N;s:2:"id";N;s:11:"blog_active";N;s:24:"blog_last_post_timestamp";N;s:6:"col_id";i:7;s:8:"col_name";s:29:"Michael Young at The National";s:16:"col_media_source";s:12:"The National";s:13:"col_home_page";s:109:"http://www.thenational.ae/apps/pbcs.dll/search?q=*&NavigatorFilter=[Byline:Michael%20Young]&BuildNavigators=1";s:13:"col_shorthand";s:8:"myoungtn";s:26:"col_media_source_shorthand";s:12:"the_national";s:27:"col_author_twitter_username";s:13:"beirutcalling";s:8:"col_tags";s:20:"columnists, politics";s:15:"col_description";s:50:"Michael Young is opinion editor of THE DAILY STAR.";s:23:"col_last_post_timestamp";i:1404314164;}i:8;O:8:"stdClass":36:{s:7:"post_id";i:31068;s:8:"post_url";s:104:"http://dailystar.com.lb/Opinion/Columnist/2014/Jun-11/259624-abandon-the-diplomacy-of-lies-and-fear.ashx";s:10:"post_title";s:38:"Abandon the diplomacy of lies and fear";s:10:"post_image";N;s:12:"post_excerpt";s:290:"A juxtaposition of recent and current tensions between a major Gulf state and the Western powers highlights yet again one of the most significant recurring themes that have defined aspects of the war-filled modern history of the Middle East.

The issue from the past is the Anglo-American war on Iraq  in 2003, which is in the news again because likely U.S.  presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, in her just-published book of memoirs, mildly apologizes for her vote to authorize that war when she was a  U.S. senator.</p><p>The common thread here is the total lack of accountability or restraint in how global, mostly Western, powers focus on an issue related to a powerful Middle Eastern country, and then take action, from sanctions to warfare and regime change, to achieve the goals they set. Clinton writes that she thought she had acted “in good faith and made the best decision I could with the information I had. And I wasn’t alone in getting it wrong. But I still got it wrong.” </p><p>And with that mild public admission of her mistake, we are asked to wipe clean the slate of moral accountability and open the way for Clinton to seek the American presidency. The immense and continuing dark consequences of the 2003 war on  Iraq are not relevant, according to this approach. We are supposed to forget the trillions of wasted dollars, the hundreds of thousands of people who have died, the millions displaced, and the continuing aftershocks of the war in the form of lawless zones that have given rise to a flourishing expansion of Salafist-takfiri Islamist militants in  Iraq and Syria. </p><p>That American intelligence agencies largely missed the truth about Iraq’s alleged weapons of mass destruction capabilities and its links with Al-Qaeda, and American and British politicians rode that wave of misinformation right into the savage war of 2003, is all supposed to be a matter for historians now. Nobody is to be held accountable for their actions or their mistakes, because the rules of power in London and Washington  assume that these Western nations can act as they wish in the Middle East, regardless of the consequences. This is the colonial way of centuries past, which persists to this day.</p><p>Middle Eastern leaders, however, are subjected to different rules of accountability. If Western powers deem them to misbehave – or merely suspect them of misbehaving, or get the cue from pro-Israel  zealots in  Washington that Arabs or Iranians have the potential to consider misbehaving in the future – then these local leaders or countries are immediately sanctioned, threatened, accused of war crimes or attacked. </p><p>The  Iran situation today continues this bitter legacy. The accusations against Iran, like those against  Iraq over a decade ago, are based largely on highly dubious evidence that has been exaggerated by a parallel streak of Israeli or neoconservative American ideological extremism. The factual basis and credibility of evidence in the case of the accusations that  Iran is planning to develop nuclear weapons remain consistently thin. </p><p>Recent advances in the negotiations with  Iran reflect a newfound desire by all concerned to explore if a satisfactory agreement can be reached. The evidence to date suggests that this is likely, and direct talks in Geneva this week wisely aim to hasten this eventuality. The lesson I draw from the past year is that direct talks to equitably implement existing international principles and rules for all sides can succeed. But if the aim is to impose Western preconceptions and fears on Middle Eastern powers based on unproven evidence and use military force to impose such dynamics, we should expect failure and likely violence.</p><p>The important element in the current case of  Iran that was missing in the  Iraq situation a decade ago is the parallel political and technical tracks. Experts in the U.S., Europe and  Iran have consistently offered proposals that can bridge the gaps in the quantities, treatment, storage and use of uranium and plutonium to fuel Iran’s nuclear reactors. Every legitimate concern expressed by the P5+1 is being addressed, yet  Iran and others fear that the real issue is not technical, but political – involving the ability of Western powers and  Israel to define who uses nuclear technology in the Middle East  and who does not. </p><p>Just this week we have learned of a new proposal by Princeton University researchers (published in the journal Arms Control Today) that suggests ways to solve the contested issue of Iran’s uranium-enrichment capacity. Conclusion: Better to deal with facts and negotiate honestly, than to bang the drums of war on the basis of predominantly American-Israeli lies and fears.</p><p>Rami G.

In the big picture of Lebanese banking, the classic performance parameters are rather well behaved this year. Assets of commercial banks stood at $166.5 billion at the end of March according to Banque du Liban (BDL), Lebanon’s central bank — up by $1.68 billion from the end of 2013 and up by 7.1 percent year on year. Private sector deposits, which started 2014 with outflows after an atypically high inflow of more than $3 billion in December, returned to a more regularly paced increase of $840 million in March and ended the first quarter at $136.6 billion. This represented 6.6 percent growth when compared with the end of Q1 2013.</p>
<p>When widening the view over the previous 12 months, sector data were not staging any alarming deviations from their long-term growth trajectories either, as proven by the full-year data for 2013. In simple terms, growth of banking assets, deposits and loans did not go AWOL in the otherwise growth-averse economy of 2013.</p>
<p><strong>The banks’ good health </strong></p>
<div><p>“2014 is not going to be a year of profitability for the banking sector”</p>
</div>
<p>Economists of Lebanon’s top banks corroborated the story told by the numbers, describing banking sector growth up to the first quarter of 2014 as satisfactory overall. “The sector has been resilient to regional turmoil, and specifically Syrian turmoil, in terms of growth and financial soundness,” said Marwan Barakat, head of research at Bank Audi, citing growth of deposits in 2013 as 8.5 percent, or $13 billion.</p>
<p>This rate of growth was sufficient to meet the needs of Lebanon’s public and private sector borrowing, Barakat explained. “We need for our deposits to grow 5 percent [annually] in order to be able to provide loans to the public and private sector and thus meet the financing needs of the entire domestic economy. Despite the crisis that affected Lebanon for the past three years, deposits growth was above that mark and thus banks have been able to finance the economy while keeping liquidity at a good level.”</p>
<p>Not only was deposits growth commensurate with the nation’s financing needs, the lending activity of Lebanese banks was also good, said Marwan Mikhael, head of research at BLOM Bank. Total lending to the private sector at the end of February 2014 stood at $47 billion, up around 9 percent year on year and representing 28.5 percent of total banking assets, he said, putting the ratio into perspective of the domestic economy by enthusing, “It is not that we are not lending; our lending is at around 100 percent of GDP.”</p>
<p>Loan to deposits ratios (LDRs) of Lebanese banks, which stand around 35 percent for the sector according to Mikhael, often appear extra slim in comparison to most countries where LDRs of 80 to 100 percent are common. However, Lebanese bankers do not tire in explaining that this is only because the banking sector’s deposit base is more than three times GDP, meaning that the sector’s theoretical full lending power is too large for the size of the domestic economy.</p>
<p>Nassib Ghobril, chief economist of Byblos Bank, confirmed the positive sentiment in difficult economic terrain and summarized the state of Lebanese banks in 2014 as being still “very solid, very liquid, highly capitalized and very well managed.”</p>
<p>From a perspective of financial investments via the securities market, banking stocks look better than real estate, said the head of research at FFA Private Bank, Nadim Kabbara. “We as FFA Research currently favor the banking sector over the real estate sector. If someone told me, ‘I want to put money into the Lebanese capital markets,’ I would guide them more to the banking sector than to the real estate sector,” he said, explaining that “while real estate sector shares, namely Solidere, can be interesting to the patient, long-term investor, the economy has not been doing so well there. In the banking sector, at least we are seeing some growth of their balance sheets.”</p>
<p><strong>A wrench in the works</strong></p>
<div><p>the new taxation would be detrimental to the Lebanese economy and … could go as far as turning investors away from contributing to banks’ capitals because of lower return prospects</p>
</div>
<p>Noting the quiet nature of Lebanon’s stock market and given that the banking sector has, in the words of BLOM’s Mikhael, “been shielded to an extent from the slowdown in the Lebanese economy since 2011,” and is overall “the most stable sector in the entire economy,” this year’s banking narrative by Executive could have been less than engaging to most audiences.</p>
<p>But the sector’s story has developed an explosive potential in the past few weeks, ever since banks were targeted as a potential fount of revenue in filling the state’s gap in financing the salaries of Lebanese public servants (see “<a href="http://www.executive-magazine.com/opinion/leaders/dont-kill-banks" target="_blank">Don’t kill the banks</a>“). The fiscal desire to tap into banking profits to the tune of an extra $250 to $300 million via inventive taxation measures is the stuff for a great debate between <a href="http://www.executive-magazine.com/opinion/comment/banks-pay-yes" target="_blank">proponents</a> and <a href="http://www.executive-magazine.com/opinion/comment/banks-pay" target="_blank">opponents</a> of the plans.</p>
<p>Another bit of relevant news is the fact that FATCA, the US tax administration’s tentacle reaching out to American citizens around the world to ensure that they pay their dues back home, is scheduled to affect Lebanese banks beginning next month (see “<a href="http://www.executive-magazine.com/business-finance/finance/lebanon-financial-sector-braces-for-fatca" target="_blank">Lebanon’s financial sector braces for FATCA</a>“).</p>
<p>In terms of profit outlooks, compliance with an ever increasing number of international demands will cost banks a pretty penny, which comes on top of the taxation challenge which bankers perceive as discriminatory. In the opinions of every last banking insider queried by Executive in the past two months, the new taxation would be detrimental to the Lebanese economy and in the view of some experts could go as far as turning investors away from contributing to banks’ capitals because of lower return prospects. Some go so far as to argue the new measures might even discourage entrepreneurs in general because of the perceived injustice and unpredictability of tax innovations.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.executive-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/20140609-bank-profit-equity.png"><img src="http://www.executive-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/20140609-bank-profit-equity.png" alt="20140609-bank-profit-equity" width="580" height="275"></a></p>
<p><strong>Expectations for 2014</strong></p>
<p>These concerns notwithstanding, the banking sector’s outlook for 2014 is not hugely different from what was seen in the first quarter and in 2013 before that. “2014 is not going to be a year of profitability for the banking sector,” said Bank Audi’s Barakat, pointing out that net profits in the first two months of 2014 registered a 17 percent decline. He added that he does not expect this decline to continue but also does not expect an increase for full-year profits relative to 2013.</p>
<p>From Mikhael’s perspective, the Lebanese banking sector is stable and it is unlikely that there will be shocks affecting the sector in 2014. “There could be an uptick in the sector if there is stability that favors the economic performance of the whole country,” he said, adding that prospects for lending growth do exist but will depend on political stability and security. “Otherwise it will continue more or less like 2013.”</p>
<div><p>“It is not that we are not lending; our lending is at around 100 percent of GDP.”</p>
</div>
<p>Byblos’ Ghobril expects prospects for lending to be impacted by the complicated political schedule. He said, “If we ask where lending opportunities to the private sector will come from this year, you firstly don’t have many new major projects or greenfield foreign direct investment projects. The public private partnership law is on hold and Lebanon faces a whole series of political deadlines starting with the presidential elections that has to be followed by government formation, and then by parliamentary elections in November and yet another government formation,” adding that “these political deadlines tend to put businesses into wait-and-see mode.”</p>
<p>In his view, for new growth to occur it does not suffice that the past three years had been marked by weakening indicators on many fronts. “Some people have a theory that the current situation will favor growth from a very low base but I don’t subscribe to that,” he emphasized. “According to the latest surveys for the Bank Byblos/American University of Beirut Consumer Confidence Index, there was a small pickup in confidence levels in Q1 of 2014 but the current levels are still not sufficient.”</p>
<p><strong>Enough profitability?</strong></p>
<p>That leaves the question of expectations for profitability. FFA’s Kabbara voiced concern that stalling of economic growth in the past year has resulted in behavior of banks that was not perfectly conducive for higher profitability. “We are not seeing much growth in the balance sheets of banks in Lebanon from domestic activity, but we are seeing more competition that is putting pressure on interest margins because banks are competing to originate loans or obtain deposits. My concern is not so much on the funding side but more on the allocation side of that capital. Banks here are very conservative in nature and that has helped Lebanon during the past financial crisis, but we are also seeing a lot of the capital being deployed into short-term liquidity such as interbank placements or deposits and reserves at BDL. This is understandable but has impacted the bottom line of banks,” he said.</p>
<div><p>The chances for a groundbreaking change in Lebanese realities may be ultra-thin, but cannot be dismissed — and the banking sector cannot discount the possibility of positive change.</p>
</div>
<p>According to FFA research notes, which only cover the three largest Lebanese banks, Audi, BLOM and Byblos, first-quarter net profits of Audi and BLOM in year-on-year comparison were flat at $86 million and $88 million while Byblos net profits went down 11 percent year on year to $31 million. The three banks’ return on equity (RoE) ratios under a trailing twelve months methodology was estimated by FFA to be 9.2 percent for Byblos, around 11.1 percent for Audi and 15 percent for BLOM.</p>
<p>RoE ratios are watched by investors checking on the performance of their investments and are important for the Lebanese banking sector because RoE and similar ratios such as return on assets as well as asset quality measures such as the non-performing loans ratio are more indicative than headline growth figures on assets and deposits when it comes to assessing the profitability and health of a bank or listed company.</p>
<p>According to Barakat, the RoE ratios of the Lebanese banking sector, recently at 12 to 12.5 percent, have been “satisfactory but not high” when compared with emerging market and regional peers. Provisions for doubtful loans have gone up, “but not significantly,” he added. “The asset quality is still good with a non-performing loans ratio of 3.3 percent.”</p>
<p>Bank Audi’s economist nonetheless warned that the fall of RoE ratios over the past three years is cause for concern. “We need to maintain capitalization levels and to do so, we have to attract shareholders. If capitalization of banks is affected, the attractiveness for deposits could be affected, and deposits are important to have the financial means to finance the deficit,” Barakat explained.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.executive-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/20140609-bank-assets-loans-deposits.png"><img src="http://www.executive-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/20140609-bank-assets-loans-deposits.png" alt="20140609-bank-assets-loans-deposits" width="580" height="275"></a></p>
<p><strong>Impact of Fed’s new rates</strong></p>
<p>The Lebanese profitability ratios have been impacted by factors that include the cost of maintaining high liquidity in an international interest rate environment that has been kept low by the policy of the US Federal Reserve for more than five years. As this scenario will likely start to change in 2015 based on the Fed’s recent announcements, Barakat said he expects the environment of increasing interest rates to allow Lebanon’s banks to hike their profitability. “We are going to improve our yield on assets while our cost of funding, which is what we are paying on our deposits, will increase, but not at the same pace. Accordingly we will be able to improve our interest margins and spreads starting in 2015,” he said.</p>
<div><p>“Since 2008 the international interest rate environment was not very favorable for our banks to place liquidity in international markets because interest rates are near zero”</p>
</div>
<p>Ghobril concurred that Lebanese banks are on the lookout for interest rates to start moving up. But he noted also that the Fed’s anticipated changes in interest rate policies take on a different and potentially much riskier dimension under a macroeconomic angle. “Since 2008 the international interest rate environment was not very favorable for our banks to place liquidity in international markets because interest rates are near zero, but this environment was favorable for managing Lebanon’s public finances,” he said.</p>
<p>“If the Fed starts increasing interest rates as planned sometime in 2015, the increase first of all appears set to be very gradual and there will be no direct effect on liquidity placements of local banks and there also will be a time lag between the rise of interest rates in the US and the arrival of higher rates in Lebanon. But we have to be ready. The years of near-zero interest rates will soon be over and we have to be prepared for it,” Ghobril cautioned (see “<a href="http://www.executive-magazine.com/opinion/leaders/fiscal-flood" target="_blank">Fiscal flood</a>“).</p>
<p>In the opinion of BLOM’s Mikhael, the scenario for Lebanon’s economy in the short term does not extend to a recession. He told Executive that “around one percent” of real GDP growth in 2014 is his worst-case expectation if the security and political situation do not make progress. A benign environment of domestic stability could in the best case generate 2.5 to 3 percent growth this year and 4 to 5 percent growth in 2015, he said, because even under a positive scenario of domestic political improvements and reforms in public finance, growth will take some time to materialize.</p>
<p><strong>Web of dependencies</strong></p>
<p>The chances for a groundbreaking change in Lebanese realities may be ultra-thin, but cannot be dismissed — and the banking sector cannot discount the possibility of positive change. Rebuilding in Syria, if peace were possible in 2015, would generate new opportunities for the banking sector and the economy in general.</p>
<p>In long-term context of the banking sector’s evolution, 2013 and the year to date reflect that the sector exists in a web of double cross-dependencies with opposing aspects. On the one hand, the sector’s need for a stable domestic operating environment and monetary stability mandates careful management of the relationship with the Lebanese state and its financing needs. On the other hand, the need to act internationally becomes more critical each year, from having to attract both capitalization and deposits to the survival necessities of deploying assets into profitable foreign operations and to being able to interact with the global banking system even in the presence of growing compliance demands.</p>
<p>The costs of both dependencies are significant and the entire sector is feeling them more strongly in 2014 than perhaps in some previous periods. But this is the price that will not disappear.</p>

Siniora is of the belief that the wage hike, as proposed by the Union Coordination Committee (UCC), would be catastrophic for public finances and the national economy. He also denies the existence of any favorable way to secure new funds by adopting a fiscal program that threatens to push away investors.</p><p>Berri didn’t reject Siniora’s concerns completely, the story adds, but he indicated that the issue has become a national matter. The parliament speaker asked the former prime minister for a way to bring a majority of lawmakers to reject the grades and salaries scale, as referred [by the previous government], in order for him to help out.</p><p>According to the same story, Siniora, head of the Future Movement parliamentary bloc, asserted to Berri that all March 14 Forces, as well as the parliamentary blocs of former Prime Minister Najib Mikati and Walid Jumblat, agreed with him. He also revealed that MP Michel Aoun promised former Prime Minister Saad Hariri to cooperate and to avoid any confrontation.</p><p>For Siniora, the involvement of Berri’s bloc would pave the way to an inclusive national aspect for covering an already disturbed discussion about the demands raised by public sector employees. He pledged that the Future Movement would be at the forefront of this mission.</p><p>Berri, Siniora and Aoun neither confirm nor deny the story. Curiously, after these meetings took place, the parliament was crippled which blocked the ratification of the grades and salaries scale. Meanwhile, Hezbollah now seems to be waging this battle alone, only backed by a few independent deputies.</p><p>Seeking to avoid broad confrontation whether inside or outside parliament, Hezbollah decided to stand by its position and back the UCC, pledging to continue to raise its voice against those blocking the pay hike, while stressing that it will hold a dialogue with its allies in the March 8 alliance and the Free Patriotic Movement to ratify the grades and salaries scale in a way that serves all parties.</p><p>Although these discussions took place a while back, nothing much has changed so far.</p><p>As Secretary General of Hezbollah Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah said a few days ago, parliamentary, political and economic forces opposing the pay hike have been recently intensely attempting to put public employees demanding their rights face to face with regular citizens. </p><p>Such a threat is expected to escalate further, amid fears that Education Minister Elias Abu Saab would resort to a “private apparel” to solve the problem raised by the official exams, even though yesterday he strongly rejected [the notion] that what he had in mind would lead to the privatization of these exams.</p><p>Granted, the education minister bears the responsibility to ensure that the official exams actually take place, and he ought to find scientific, legal and constitutional means that would lead to holding the exams without undermining the public sector, the country and the rights of citizens.</p><p>If he had been acting this way, we wouldn’t have heard voices warning that the minister’s actions will set a precedent which would eventually end the services of public sector teachers in writing, surveilling and correcting the exams, thus raising legitimate fears of privatizing this annual event.</p><p>The [education] minister’s responsibility is to support the UCC; he ought to stand against all attempts to water down its cause or to besiege it.”</p><p>But is the minister’s responsibility and that of the Change and Reform Bloc restricted to holding the exams?</p><p>Of course not! Their main responsibility is to acknowledge - and not just through statements and positions - the rights of public sector employees and teachers, and to seek to ratify these rights. In fact, General Aoun’s bloc is aware more than any other party of the focal points of theft and squandering that deprive the state’s treasury from enough returns to develop many sectors.</p><p>Hence, the minister’s responsibility is to support the UCC; he ought to stand against all attempts to water down its cause or to besiege it. He is to prohibit disarming it from its legitimate weapons, even if this leads to a crisis, known as the official exams</p><p>Meanwhile, everyone knows that the state can afford to postpone the exams till after the World Cup competition. Past experiences have proven that such exams can be prepared, held and corrected in a short period of time, which will no doubt happen if the teachers’ demands are granted.</p><p>Therefore, it is not true that holding the exams is more important than the teaches’ demands. If some in the country are willing to continue playing the blackmailing game, then it’s the responsibility of General Aoun’s bloc and Minister Abu Saab to not play along.</p><p>On the contrary, the minister is expected to warn about the risks of not approving the grades and salaries scale, not announcing that the state can manage without the teachers and do whatever it pleases, even if the issue concerns the official exams which affect tens of thousands of families.</p><p>Such pressure shouldn’t force us to cope with killers and thieves who don’t want to meet the legitimate and rightful demands of the people.</p><p>Following Sayyed Nasrallah’s call last Friday, we can honestly say that Speaker Berri and General Aoun bear a big responsibility. If they choose to give priority to the grades and salaries scale, then it would be possible to push others in different parliamentary blocs to cooperate in order to achieve this target.</p><p>Today, no other priority should come before the UCC’s rights and demands!</p><p>This article is an edited translation from the Arabic Edition.</p>";s:17:"post_image_height";i:498;s:16:"post_image_width";i:780;s:11:"post_visits";i:8;s:18:"post_twitterShares";i:0;s:19:"post_facebookShares";i:2;s:16:"post_totalShares";i:2;s:16:"post_socialScore";i:11;s:13:"post_virality";i:6;s:9:"blog_name";N;s:16:"blog_description";N;s:8:"blog_url";N;s:11:"blog_author";N;s:28:"blog_author_twitter_username";N;s:13:"blog_rss_feed";N;s:9:"blog_tags";N;s:2:"id";N;s:11:"blog_active";N;s:24:"blog_last_post_timestamp";N;s:6:"col_id";i:5;s:8:"col_name";s:36:"Ibrahim al-Amin at Al-Akhbar English";s:16:"col_media_source";s:17:"Al-Akhbar English";s:13:"col_home_page";s:37:"http://english.al-akhbar.com/node/125";s:13:"col_shorthand";s:8:"iaminakh";s:26:"col_media_source_shorthand";s:9:"al_akhbar";s:27:"col_author_twitter_username";N;s:8:"col_tags";s:20:"columnists, politics";s:15:"col_description";s:51:"Ibrahim al-Amin is the Editor in Chief of Al-Akhbar";s:23:"col_last_post_timestamp";i:1403780933;}i:12;O:8:"stdClass":36:{s:7:"post_id";i:30971;s:8:"post_url";s:78:"http://www.executive-magazine.com/business-finance/finance/banking-future-iraq";s:10:"post_title";s:29:"Banking on the future of Iraq";s:10:"post_image";s:73:"http://www.executive-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/ATM-Iraq.jpg";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:123:"Lebanese banks have enjoyed a long history of Iraqi businessmen coming to the country and banking here, or so boasts Mak...";s:7:"blog_id";s:20:"livia-murray-execmag";s:14:"post_timestamp";i:1402317300;s:12:"post_content";s:11722:"<img width="640" height="360" src="http://www.executive-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/ATM-Iraq-640x360.jpg" alt="A user withdraws money from the Iraqi Warka Bank ATM (automatic teller machine) in Ghelan Square in central Baghdad on August 18, 2008.

Now it is the banks that are taking their businesses to Iraq. But while the banks see a lot of promise in the Iraqi market, their small investment to date reflects the major difficulties of operating a commercial bank in Iraq.</p>
<div><p>Iraq is still one of the most under-banked countries in the MENA region, with estimates that 80 percent of the population does not have a bank account.</p>
</div>
<p>With seven Lebanese banks operating 14 branches in Iraq, and giants BLOM Bank and Bank Audi set to enter the market within the year, more than half of Lebanon’s alpha group banks will be represented. These banks see potential in the Iraqi market as it undergoes modernization and revitalization of both physical and financial infrastructure. Though they already make up half of the total foreign banks present in Iraq, excluding representative offices, Lebanese banks’ investment in Iraq is still “light” compared to their capital base, according to Sader, and their activities are still limited.</p>
<p><b>Room for growth</b></p>
<p><a href="http://www.executive-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/20140609-tourist-arrivals.png"><img src="http://www.executive-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/20140609-tourist-arrivals.png" alt="20140609-tourist-arrivals" width="600" height="285"></a></p>
<p> </p>
<p>After a slight drop between 2008 and 2009, Iraq’s nominal GDP has consistently grown from its 2009 level of $111.7 billion to $215.8 billion in 2012, <a href="http://databank.worldbank.org/data/views/reports/tableview.aspx#" target="_blank">according to the World Bank</a>. Domestic credit to the private sector as a percent of GDP has been rising steadily, from 3.8 percent in 2009 to 6 percent in 2012. While still small compared to the regional average — at 23.6 percent of GDP in 2012 for MENA minus the GCC and Israel — the increase in lending as a percentage of GDP is a positive and promising trend.</p>
<p>According to a <a href="http://www.iraq-businessnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Sansar-Capital-Iraq-Bank-Sector-Report-May-June-2013.pdf" target="_blank">2013 report by Singapore-based but Iraq-focused Sansar Capital</a>, Iraq is still one of the most under-banked countries in the MENA region, with estimates that 80 percent of the population does not have a bank account. According to the World Bank, the country had 5.4 commercial bank branches per 100,000 people in 2012. By comparison, Lebanon had 29.3 branches per 100,000 people.</p>
<p>The lack of ATMs — two for every 100,000 inhabitants — is exacerbated by the fact that most ATMs are not connected to a national switch and thus customers from one bank cannot use the ATM of another bank to make transactions, creating more barriers to consumer banking. These pose both opportunities and constraints for Lebanese banks moving into the country.</p>
<p>However, several reform efforts appear promising. Two projects to facilitate retail banking are in the pipeline. The first is the implementation of a national switch that would connect ATMs of various banks. The second is the Iraq Interoperable Mobile Payments System (IIMPS), which could dramatically increase the penetration of banking among the cash-oriented population. Both projects are due to begin pilot testing this summer.</p>
<div><p>Despite minimal interference from an Iraqi controller, it’s not easy being a commercial bank in Iraq, where state owned banks dominate the field and enjoy several privileges over their commercial counterparts.</p>
</div>
<p>Another encouraging development is the government’s efforts to develop the country’s infrastructure, which could lead to an increase in economic output triggering an increase in demand for banking services. In 2013 the Iraqi Ministry of Planning <a href="http://www.iraq-businessnews.com/2013/09/18/new-357bn-national-development-plan/" target="_blank">launched Iraq’s second National Development Plan</a>, which laid out a roadmap for the country’s economic recovery between 2013 and 2017. The plan consists of a $357 billion investment in infrastructure in various sectors of the Iraqi economy. If carried out, it could have a massive effect on the economy: in general, the World Bank estimates a 1 percent increase in economic output for every 10 percent increase in infrastructure allocation. Iraq’s total national budget in 2013 was $118 billion.</p>
<p>These projects could increase both lending and deposits at banks. According to <a href="http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTMENA/Resources/QuickNote44.pdf" target="_blank">a 2011 World Bank report</a>, Iraq’s asset-to-GDP ratio was 73 percent after adjusting for certain state owned banks’ overstated asset valuations — compared to 130 percent for the MENA region.</p>
<p>Such numbers appeal to Lebanese banks, which are putting their faith in the growth of Iraq’s economy and banking sector. “With time, I believe the banking industry will grow, and quickly,” says Fahim Mo’dad, advisor to the chairman at BLOM Bank and the individual responsible for the bank’s expansion into Iraq. BLOM is planning to open two branches within the year, one in Erbil and one in Baghdad, according to Mo’dad.</p>
<p><strong><span>R</span>egulation and restriction</strong></p>
<p>Lebanese banks in Iraq are subject to <a href="http://www.cbi.iq/documents/banking_law_f.pdf" target="_blank">the country’s 2003 Banking Law</a>, as well as the same international regulations they are following elsewhere. Licenses for a foreign-owned bank in Iraq are issued by the Central Bank of Iraq (CBI), and require compliance monitoring from the country where the parent bank’s head office is located. They also require the Lebanese central bank’s approval. Sader explains that the Lebanese Banking Control Commission signed an agreement with its Iraqi counterpart that would make BDL control their activities in Iraq. “[The CBI] doesn’t have the human resources to control … [BDL] is helping them to control our maximum,” says Sader.</p>
<div><p>The lack of ATMs — two for every 100,000 inhabitants — is exacerbated by the fact that most ATMs are not connected to a national switch … creating more barriers to consumer banking.</p>
</div>
<p>Despite minimal interference from an Iraqi controller, it’s not easy being a commercial bank in Iraq, where state owned banks dominate the field and enjoy several privileges over their commercial counterparts. State owned banks have a monopoly on transactions involving the government and government owned companies. In a country where the government controls the oil sector, which accounts for three fifths of the economy, and where the public sector and state owned enterprises <a href="http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/COUNTRIES/MENAEXT/IRAQEXTN/0,,menuPK:313115~pagePK:141132~piPK:141107~theSitePK:313105,00.html" target="_blank">employ about half the labor force</a>, this places severe limits on the business of commercial banks.</p>
<p>Government entities and state owned enterprises cannot, for instance, place deposits with commercial banks, and payments to the government (such as taxes) cannot be drawn from commercial banks. Likewise, <a href="http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTMENA/Resources/QuickNote44.pdf" target="_blank">state-owned agencies cannot receive loans from commercial banks</a>.</p>
<p>This has led to the disproportionate size of state owned banks compared to commercial banks in Iraq. According to Abdul Aziz Hassoun, executive director of the Iraqi Private Banks League, the seven state-owned banks account for more than half of all bank capital with IQD 14 trillion ($12 billion) out of a total IQD 25 trillion ($21.4 billion).</p>
<p>According to Hassoun, Lebanese banks are under the same constraints as any commercial bank in Iraq. The only transactions Lebanese banks can do in Iraq with government accounts or government owned entities is issuing letters of guarantees (LGs). They cannot, for instance, take deposits, make transfers or issue letters of credit (LCs) from these entities. This was confirmed by Elias Achkar, head of the research department at ABL. However, Sader claims that Lebanese banks are trying to work out a deal where they would be able to make transactions with the government and government owned companies.</p>
<p><strong><span>S</span>tarting small</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.executive-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/20140609-iraq-banks-map.png"><img src="http://www.executive-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/20140609-iraq-banks-map.png" alt="20140609-iraq-banks-map" width="300" height="300"></a></p>
<p>Despite the room for growth in lending to the Iraqi market and the competitive edge of Lebanese banks with superior technical infrastructure and internal processes, it is not the lending ceiling that is imposed on every Lebanese bank abroad by the BDL that is crippling their activities. In fact, lending activity only accounts for a small margin of their profits.</p>
<p>According to Sader, the primary activity of Lebanese banks in Iraq is trade finance, with their primary source of revenue coming from LCs and LGs. They also make margins off foreign currency auctions, whereby they buy foreign currency from the Central Bank of Iraq at the daily currency auction — the only way to convert the Iraqi dinar — and then sell it to their clients with a certain margin of profit allowed by the CBI, according to Mo’dad.</p>
<p>Their smaller lending activities are mostly geared toward their Lebanese clients, according to Hassoun, who claims it is normal for a foreign bank to first capitalize on these business relations. “When Standard Chartered came to the country, they were only covering the needs of British companies working in construction and oil,” he says.</p>
<p>Focusing on Lebanese clients is also less risky for the bank. “The institutional environment in Iraq is lacking. If we want to lend money to a client, they don’t have a ‘centrale des risques’, they don’t have a clearing house,” says Sader, “They will start with Lebanese clients, which is easier because they might have information on them for Lebanon,” says Mo’dad.</p>
<p>Despite these setbacks, Sader claims that the Iraqi banking sector is working on modernizing its infrastructure, something the Lebanese banking sector is well poised to assist them with. In April, the Iraqi-Lebanese Banking Conference was held in Beirut which highlighted a common interest of both sectors in improving the banking environment in Iraq’s recovering economy. With time and the right developments, the hope is that Lebanese banks’ strategy of early entry into Iraq will pay off handsomely.</p>

Index movements in nine of the twelve markets during the week were by less than two percent — except for a renewed hike in the EGX 30 and corrections in Qatar and Abu Dhabi, which were all between three and four percent. Besides Egypt’s 3.1 percent gain, seven markets moved up, but for six of them, the range of advance was between 0.1 and 1 percent. Beirut and Casablanca joined Abu Dhabi and Doha in moving down.</p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.executive-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/20140609-indices-week-23.png"><img src="http://www.executive-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/20140609-indices-week-23.png" alt="Index performance" width="300" height="522"></a></span></p>
<p><strong>Emerging players</strong></p>
<p>The impact of the transition of the United Arab Emirates and Qatar <a href="http://www.executive-magazine.com/business-finance/finance/msci-announcement-drives-markets" target="_blank">from frontier to emerging markets status in the MSCI</a> once again — but possibly for the last time for some while — was the most visible driver of index developments in the Gulf Cooperation Council.</p>
<p>The QE General Index closed the week 3.4 percent lower, but when compared with its intraday all-time peak of 13,909 points on May 29, the gauge dropped nearly 5 percent in a week. Abu Dhabi — which closed last month very near to a multi-year record, also achieved intraday on May 29 — fell by almost 4 percent. Dubai, on the other hand, was not quite as ebullient in the last week of May and eked out a 0.3 percent gain.</p>
<p>With MSCI EM-tracking passive funds entering the three markets at the end of May and in the first few days of June, the volumes of trade on all three were significantly above average in the first two to three sessions of the new month, but tapered out toward the end of the trading week. According to reports by two UAE newspapers, <a href="http://gulfnews.com/business/markets/dfm-drops-2-51-adx-falls-1-14-1.1344639" target="_blank">Gulf News</a> and <a href="http://www.thenational.ae/business/industry-insights/markets/uae-stock-markets-buzz-with-activity-on-day-one-of-msci-upgrade" target="_blank">The National</a>, local market participation during the week was characterized on one hand by investor caution in the aftermath of recent hyperactive trading, but on the other hand also saw many new and inexperienced day traders come onto the scene in search of wins.</p>
<p><strong>Expanding frontiers</strong></p>
<p>A fourth GCC market that was affected by MSCI’s reshuffle of its Frontier and Emerging Markets index compositions is Kuwait. It remains part of the Frontier Markets index, but the representation of Kuwaiti stocks in the FM Investable Markets Index — which MSCI stated as 16.45 percent in the index’s May 30 factsheet — was set to expand by about six percentage points after the index’s rebalancing due to the reclassification of Qatari and Emirati stocks which had been part of the FM IMI. Reports on GCC markets said that the KSE could see increased funds inflows due to the KSE’s enlarged role in the Frontier Markets indices.</p>
<p>However, impact of the increased MSCI weightings of KSE-listed stocks on their share prices did not jump last week out either in terms of the KSE Index performance or via price changes of the stocks with the highest FM IMI weightings, which according to the May 30 factsheet were National Bank of Kuwait (NBK), telecommunications group Zain and Kuwait Finance House (KFH).</p>
<p>The KSE Index fluctuated by not more than 2 percent and subdued trade volumes on the KSE were in no way comparable to the May 29 and June 1 surges of activity seen in the UAE and Qatar. According to market statistics by Kuwait Financial Center Markaz, the share prices of NBK, Zain and KFH dropped by 1 percent, 1.16 percent and 1.22 percent respectively in the first week of June. Trade volumes of NBK, Zain and Agility, another large cap KSE company in the FM index, were elevated but not radically so. Agility, a logistics company, was the only large cap Kuwaiti company that recorded a substantial price gain in the week, moving up by 4.9 percent.</p>
<p>Overall, local factors such as the perceived lack of transparency, as well as disclosure practices marred by time delays and alleged information leaks seemed to remain much stronger influences on the KSE than the country’s inconclusive position of being a major frontier market.</p>
<p>Saudi Arabia’s Tadawul, the largest securities market in the MENA, progressed to a new post-financial crisis high on June 1. While the TASI closed the week only with a small gain, this further supported the bourse’s overall impression as having a stable upward trajectory. The index action on the Bahrain Bourse was unremarkable for yet another week. The Muscat Securities Market continued a rise that started on May 28 and was the GCC’s strongest gainer in the week.</p>
<p>In the context of market valuations and long-term performances, the Omani and Bahraini markets are positioned having the GCC’s lowest price to earnings ratios at 10.5 and 11.7 respectively at the end of May, according to Markaz. Tadawul is more costly with a P/E ratio of 17.1, but although it has gained 17 percent in the year to date, it is still is almost 11,000 points below its historic pre-crisis peak. Consequently, the TASI has the room to gain almost 110 percent — more than any other GCC market — before it would reach another all time index record.</p>
<p><strong>North Africa & the Levant</strong></p>
<p>In the North African markets, the Tunisian Stock Exchange showed some micro-volatility, but the Tunindex moved sideways, closing yet another week of flat performance. The MASI’s performance reflected a week of almost daily drops on the Casablanca Stock Exchange; the market recorded a close below 9,400 points for the first time since the end of February. In the context of the past 12 months, however, the MASI remains on middle ground. With a 3.1 percent gain, the Egyptian market recouped part of the territory lost in the previous, rather volatile <a href="http://www.executive-magazine.com/business-finance/finance/market-presidential-plummet" target="_blank">election week</a>. Before climbing 150 points on Wednesday, June 4, and more than 380 points on June 5, the EGX 30 had finished two of the week’s sessions below 8,000 points.</p>
<p>The Amman Stock Exchange continued an upward momentum that started in the previous week and gained 1 percent in the ASE Index. The BLOM Index for the Beirut Stock Exchange saw about half of its gain from the previous week wither away, dropping 0.9 percent in the week.</p>

According to the airline&#x2019;s website no financial statements have been released for 2013, but in 2012 it posted a net profit of US$58 million in an increase of 44 per cent on the meagre $40.4m it made in 2011. I say &#x201c;meagre&#x201d; because in 2009, arguably Lebanon&#x2019;s best year since the end of the civil war in 1975, MEA racked up a net profit of $118.1m, before it dipped to $90.6m in 2010. Then Syria happened.</p><p>The chairman Mohamad El Hout, appointed by the airline&#x2019;s owners the Central Bank in 1998, has proved his doubters wrong by restructuring the once-pioneering airline, buying new aircraft and making it profitable. Throw in MEA&#x2019;s relatively high prices and it should be the region&#x2019;s boutique carrier. But despite a healthy bottom line, the performance of the brand, and in particular the level of service, has never matched that of the balance sheet. The only glamour MEA projects is that of an ageing film star still trying to convince the world she&#x2019;s still got what it takes.</p><p>I say all this because last week I flew to Beirut from London on MEA and the experience was anything but boutique. In fact it made easyJet, the low-cost carrier I flew with to France a week earlier, look like Etihad Airways in comparison. At least easyJet made no bones about what it was and did it well. The staff were cheery and efficient and brooked no nonsense or antisocial behaviour. You&#x2019;d have to clip electrodes to my nether regions and flick the switch before I would say the same about the cabin crew on ME 202.</p><p>The flight, which was full and with a higher than usual compliment of small children, all of whom appeared to be in the grip of a massive sugar rush, was forced to sit on the tarmac for more than an hour before take-off. Lebanese parents are not famed for their discipline and the mother on the row of seats across the aisle from me did nothing to stop her two bored kids trying to dismantle the in-flight entertainment system before deciding it might be a wheeze to continuously open and then snap shut the seatbelt clasps. The stewardess walked by on more than one occasion and did nothing.</p><p>When we did get going, the cabin crew appeared to make up for lost time by practically throwing the dinner trays at the passengers. There was also an inexplicable departure from convention, not to mention logic, when the food trolley preceded the drinks trolley, leaving passengers with two options: wait for a drink and let the food go cold or tuck in and run the risk of finishing dinner before the drinks trolley arrived.</p><p>Am I nitpicking? When I am paying nigh on $1,000 for a ticket on a four-hour flight I expect the basics to be done well. So when I pointed out to the stewardess that I didn&#x2019;t really want a drink any more as I had finished my meal, she shrugged at my apparent ingratitude, said it was a &#x201c;full flight&#x201d; and moved on.</p><p>It&#x2019;s not the first time I have seen MEA&#x2019;s veneer of polish crumble under a bit of pressure. The cabin crew could have been plucked from central casting. They were all very pretty and magnificently groomed, but all this counts for nought if they don&#x2019;t smile. It&#x2019;s their job to be enthusiastic.</p><p>I wanted this to be more than just a rant about a bad flight. MEA is another example of unfulfilled Lebanese potential. It should be more than just an overpriced taxi service for expats who use it because they can behave how they like and staffed by defeated young ladies, many of whom I doubt are imbued with a genuine love for the job. The money is there, the fleet is new and the pilots are among the best trained in the region. With better service, a positive attitude and the will to control the cabin, MEA can be a powerful ambassador and a reflection of Lebanon&#x2019;s colourful diversity and generosity of spirit.</p><p>Michael Karam is a freelance writer based in Beirut </p><p></p><p>Follow us on Twitter @Ind_Insights</p>";s:17:"post_image_height";i:0;s:16:"post_image_width";i:0;s:11:"post_visits";i:21;s:18:"post_twitterShares";i:7;s:19:"post_facebookShares";i:140;s:16:"post_totalShares";i:147;s:16:"post_socialScore";i:41;s:13:"post_virality";i:40;s:9:"blog_name";N;s:16:"blog_description";N;s:8:"blog_url";N;s:11:"blog_author";N;s:28:"blog_author_twitter_username";N;s:13:"blog_rss_feed";N;s:9:"blog_tags";N;s:2:"id";N;s:11:"blog_active";N;s:24:"blog_last_post_timestamp";N;s:6:"col_id";i:6;s:8:"col_name";s:29:"Michael Karam at The National";s:16:"col_media_source";s:12:"The National";s:13:"col_home_page";s:109:"http://www.thenational.ae/apps/pbcs.dll/search?q=*&NavigatorFilter=[Byline:Michael%20Karam]&BuildNavigators=1";s:13:"col_shorthand";s:8:"mkaramtn";s:26:"col_media_source_shorthand";s:12:"the_national";s:27:"col_author_twitter_username";s:15:"Lebanesewineman";s:8:"col_tags";s:20:"columnists, politics";s:15:"col_description";s:40:"Michael Karam is a writer and journalist";s:23:"col_last_post_timestamp";i:1404727872;}i:15;O:8:"stdClass":36:{s:7:"post_id";i:30865;s:8:"post_url";s:105:"http://dailystar.com.lb/Opinion/Columnist/2014/Jun-07/259203-blame-the-state-for-sham-arab-democracy.ashx";s:10:"post_title";s:39:"Blame the state for sham Arab democracy";s:10:"post_image";N;s:12:"post_excerpt";s:304:"The recent string of “elections” across the Arab world raises profound questions about the Arab world’s apparent difficulty in adopting institutions and practices of liberal pluralistic democracies.But is the problem really about the ability of Arab social values to accommodate democracy, or is...";s:7:"blog_id";N;s:14:"post_timestamp";i:1402121191;s:12:"post_content";s:5090:"<p>The recent string of “elections” across the Arab world raises profound questions about the Arab world’s apparent difficulty in adopting institutions and practices of liberal pluralistic democracies.</p><p>But is the problem really about the ability of Arab social values to accommodate democracy, or is there a deeper problem related to the clumsy nature of statehood that has emerged in this region during the past century? </p><p>The “elections” I refer to include spectacles in Algeria, Egypt, Syria, Iraq, and the Lebanese presidential election-selection that was not even held on time due to political bickering among the country’s sectarian leaders. The Egyptian, Syrian and Algerian cases repeat the ugly legacy of the modern Arab tradition of family-run security states and dictatorships that put on a show of voting to secure approval ratings of 87 or 93 or 97 percent, complete with adoring crowds of supporters of the “Great Leader.”</p><p>Why do Arab autocrats try to legitimize their life-long rule, despite the total lack of credibility of the “elections” they hold? Nowhere in the normal world do elections result in victories of such magnitude as routinely occur in Arab “elections.” But parliaments in these lands have little substance, because real power is vested in the family or soldiers who run the country. (The only comparable unnatural phenomenon I know of is the almost unanimous support for pro-Israel  resolutions in the U.S.  Congress, which probably reflects a similar dynamic at play, in other words you vote “yes” for the Arab president or the pro- Israel resolution, or you lose your seat.)</p><p>The Lebanese and Iraqi cases are different, but equally problematic. Iraq’s elections resulted in a more natural distribution of gains among the competing political parties. The problem here is that the electoral system initiated by the U.S.-run transitional authority after the Anglo-American war on Iraq  in 2003 has been built on a foundation of deep sectarianism, so the election results in parliament mirror the sectarian tensions, mistrust and cleavages in Iraq. Consequently, the Iraqi parliament and government as a whole have been largely dysfunctional institutions that have struggled for the past decade to provide services and security throughout the country, often without success.</p><p>The Lebanese case is also a fascinating example of electoral institutions that allow citizen participation in governance, but do not, in fact, impact deeply on decision-making. The sectarian-based Lebanese system has operated for some years now on the principle that a broad national consensus must be reached on major policy decisions, and a simple majority in parliament is not enough. Such consensus is usually generated at late-night dinners at the homes of sectarian leaders who also head political groupings in parliament. </p><p>This is a modernized version of traditional tribal councils that have defined collective decision-making in the Middle East for thousands of years. Tribal leaders engage informally to iron out their differences, do some horse-trading, and finally achieve a consensus, which citizens dutifully applaud. If there is no consensus, one or more parties would usually boycott governance institutions and send the whole system into hibernation, as happens in Lebanon routinely, when the country lacks a cabinet, a president, a functioning parliament or some other vital institution. Yet life goes on more or less normally, because real power is not vested in these institutions, but rather in the informal meetings of heads of sects (or of tribes in places such as Jordan, Yemen or Libya).</p><p>So it is simple enough for most of us to just ignore the elections taking place in the region. Yet we have had glimpses of democratic transitions that include more credible elements, such as the Tunisian elections in recent years, or the 2012 Egyptian presidential election that saw one candidate win by just a few percentage points. </p><p>We also see credible elections taking place all over the region in professional associations or student groups. So the idea that Arabs cannot behave democratically and electorally is nonsense. </p><p>What is the problem, then? The continuing insult of Arab presidential elections such as we have recently witnessed in Algeria, Egypt  and Syria  suggest to me that the problem is squarely in the nature of state configuration and the exercise of power. When citizens have no say in how to shape and define their state and its institutions of decision-making, power remains almost exclusively in the hands of a family or elite at the top that controls the state budget and enjoys the support of the armed forces, in other words that controls the guns and the money. </p><p>Citizens across the Arab world have risen up in revolt against this pattern of rule, which nevertheless has endured in Syria, Bahrain, Egypt, Sudan  and Algeria, among others. </p><p>Rami G.

<p><strong><a href="http://www.girnaas.com/#" target="_blank">Girnaas</a></strong></p>
<p>Founded: 2013</p>
<p>Country: Qatar</p>
<p>Cofounders: Munera Al-Dosari, Fatima Al-Kuwari and Faraj Abdulla</p>
<p><strong>The idea: </strong>Girnaas is a game making and publishing studio that strives to bring new stories into the fast world of gaming, which has a high rate of recycling old titles. Many popular games come out with a second, a third — even a sixth version. And characters such as Aladdin, one of the many characters in famous collection of Middle Eastern folk tales “One Thousand and One Nights,” are constantly being recycled, while other lesser known characters remain in the shadows. It is the stories of these lesser known characters that Girnaas is trying to tell through their games.</p>
<p><strong>Traction:</strong> Thus far Girnaas has published three games and reached 350,000 downloads, according to the team. The games are free, with the company focusing on building traction. The team plans to eventually license their ideas and characters to generate revenue.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.aidbits.com/" target="_blank">AidBits</a></strong></p>
<p>Founded: 2013</p>
<p>Country: Palestine</p>
<p>Cofounders: Feras Nasr and Ibrahim Abu Kteish</p>
<p><strong>The idea:</strong> To alleviate the chaos of multiple spreadsheets and databases, AidBits devised a platform to help NGOs manage and track the reams of data they sometimes collect. NGOs can go into the program, customize their indicators and set targets. The platform enables them to gather data throughout the life of a project in one place, also giving them a dashboard that displays the progression of the data — something that can be used to impress donors. The data is stored on a cloud, but there is an offline version that NGO officers can use when working in places without an internet connection, which can later be synced with the cloud.</p>
<p><strong>Traction:</strong> AidBits is used by the Palestine branches of the NGOs <a href="http://www.pu-ami.org/" target="_blank">Première Urgence</a> and <a href="http://www.care-international.org/" target="_blank">Care International</a>, who are their paying clients, as well as several other NGOs who are still in the free trial mode. Première Urgence liked the product so much that they wanted the rest of their offices to start using the platform. The company charges a yearly fee for their software.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.theblackbox.me/" target="_blank">BlackBox</a></strong></p>
<p>Founded: 2013</p>
<p>Country: Lebanon</p>
<p>Cofounders: Christine Dwairi and George Eid</p>
<p><strong>The idea:</strong> BlackBox prints photos at events that attendees upload on Instagram with the event’s hashtag. It prints old school polaroid-like photos, which gives partygoers a memory of the event, all the while promoting the brand hosting the event by its active presence over social media. The BlackBox team rents the equipment to the hosts of the event, and provides them with support services. At the end of the event, BlackBox also presents a report with an analysis of the likes, comments, impressions and context of the social media content.</p>
<p><strong>Traction:</strong> BlackBox’s first event was in November 2013 in Beirut at the <a href="http://www.redbull.com/mea/en/music/stories/1331621766738/mashrou-leila-clashed-with-who-killed-bruce-lee" target="_blank">Red Bull Soundclash</a> between Lebanese bands Mashrou’ Leila and Who Killed Bruce Lee. Besides Red Bull,  their clients include Absolute Vodka and Time Out. They’ve done events in Beirut, Dubai, Doha and New York.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://enigmedia.es/en/" target="_blank">Enigmedia</a></strong></p>
<p>Founded in: 2011</p>
<p>Country: Spain</p>
<p>Founder: Gerard Vidal</p>
<p><strong>The idea</strong>: Enigmedia encrypts information in real time using a technology that improves transmission by using less bandwidth, making the information sent of better quality. It is well adapted to high definition real time video transmission — for instance getting rid of pixelation. Its complexity also makes it more difficult to hack in a world where the increase in communication over digital media is paired with a concomitant increase in security issues. The technology uses an algorithm that was developed by founder Gerard Vidal while writing his doctoral thesis.</p>
<p><strong>Traction: </strong>Enigmedia’s clients include Deloitte Barcelona, Football Club Barcelona and La Caixa bank. They charge a monthly fee for the software, which can be used either through an app or through Enigmedia’s television platform.</p>

Walid Jumblatt, surveying the changes all around him, decided to effect his own reconciliation with Assad, reversing course only when the uprising in Syria began.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This was all par for the course in a country where the political class is either unwilling or unable to behave autonomously. In such shifting sands, what chance did Samir Kassir&rsquo;s fate have to leave an enduring mark on justice in Lebanon, and to change the way the country functioned politically? None at all.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Kassir understood well the interconnectedness of Arab dissatisfaction and solidarity. Only six years after his death, this would be demonstrated in a succession of Arab uprisings feeding off each other. These were dynamics which Kassir would well have understood, given his tendency to consider the Arab world as an integrated whole. For him, there was something intimately linking the Lebanese desire for freedom from Syria to the Syrian people&rsquo;s longing for liberty at home. And the Palestinians&rsquo; yearning for a state seemed no different in his mind from the Iraqis&rsquo; pursuit of political self-determination after 2003. Kassir was no defender of the Bush administration&rsquo;s invasion of Iraq, but he was also not as willing as many of his contemporaries to dismiss the advantages to Iraqis of finally being freed from a pathological, homicidal regime.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Had Kassir been alive, what would he have told us about the situation in Syria? Some 160,000 people have been killed there, yet the individual most responsible for this butchery is still in power and has just organized his own fraudulent re-election. Kassir would have surely been one of the most biting commentators on this outrage and a vocal defender of the opposition, but also one of its most lucid critics.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Kassir would have been pitiless in condemning the West&rsquo;s pathetic response in Syria. Though he always warned of the dangers of Western intervention in the Middle East, Kassir also grasped its liberalizing potential. That&rsquo;s why he told me in an interview a year almost to the day before his murder, &ldquo;[T]he West must accept that the strategic importance of the Middle East must not justify denying its peoples the right to self-determination, and that means, particularly, the Palestinians.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>One can imagine the disdain he would have felt for Western countries, above all the United States, who have behaved with almost surrealistic indifference and incompetence in Syria. Twenty years after the Rwandan genocide, with Western officials regretting their inaction at the time, another killing field is in place, its horrors multiplying daily, unabated. Is that the way it has to be? Permitting a slaughter to continue, only to regret it two decades hence, when guilt matters not at all?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Kassir&rsquo;s last book Considerations sue le Malheur Arabe (with the far less evocative English title of Being Arab) received many plaudits after his assassination. Its main theme is that the Arabs can plot a path toward national revival through a reconsideration of their own rich history, one that could help them do away with the &ldquo;perennial powerlessness&rdquo; [that] &ldquo;annulled the possibility of a new reawakening.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>There was much of the author&rsquo;s optimism and exuberance in the book. Its tragedy was that this singular intellectual&rsquo;s effort to try to see through the region&rsquo;s miasma toward the possibility of a sunnier future was cut short by the reality of the Arab world&rsquo;s violent present. That present is still with us, more offensive and vicious than ever. And the hope that Kassir&rsquo;s senseless murder would somehow alter this situation proved illusory.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Like the Cheshire Cat in Alice in Wonderland, all that is left of Samir is his grin. It appears to be a grin both humorous and provocative. March 14, perhaps understandably, made a plaster saint of him, when he never had the slightest intention of being something so dull. Instead, he was all life, and it is that which defined his outlook on his country and the Middle East.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Nine years later the grin is still there, but we&rsquo;re not sure if it is an expression of satisfaction or a grimace of displeasure for what he has been turned into. All we can say with every passing year is that Samir Kassir becomes more relevant, his absence more oppressive. His writings brought order to the chaos of a region that eats its children. What a waste his death has been.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Michael Young is opinion editor of The Daily Star newspaper.

Supporters in the Beqaa and in Tripoli&rsquo;s Alawite-populated Jabal Mohsen, as well as in Beirut&rsquo;s southern suburbs, celebrated Assad&rsquo;s victory as their own. You&rsquo;d think Imam Mahdi had finally appeared, or that Israel had been wiped off the map.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It was a significant show of power, dominance, and entitlement, as if to say, &ldquo;We are here, we are everywhere, we have weapons, and we will use them anytime we want. You &ndash; the insignificant others &ndash; cannot do anything.&rdquo; It was a sign of the power that had forced many Syrians to vote[MG1]&nbsp; for an incumbent president who had wreaked havoc on their nation. And that&rsquo;s the only thing that matters. Victory is about the ability to stay in power, no matter what the consequences are.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Drunk with power and triumph, Hezbollah and its supporters will now look further down on anyone in disagreement with them, and even more so if you are a Shiite. Whoever you are, you&rsquo;ll be a traitor, a symbol of betrayal to the Resistance and all the sacredness it carries. But if you&rsquo;re a Shiite, your betrayal is more striking because, simply, this fight is about your identity and the community&rsquo;s sense of power and righteousness. The Resistance tolerates no resisting, especially not from Shiites. The Resistance is about dominance.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>What is it like to be a Shiite today?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>At best, you are a Shiite first and a Lebanese second. You are the daughter &ndash; or son &ndash; of the Resistance, not a Lebanese citizen. Your land, your family, your home, and your life are not yours. They belong to the Resistance. All you are and all you have are a price to be paid at the altar of the Resistance, because liberation &ndash; supposedly a calling &ndash; turned out to be a very costly endeavor, for which you have to pay everything and cease to live.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you disagree with Iran&rsquo;s policy in the region, it means you&rsquo;ve betrayed all the Ahl El Beit, from Imam Hussein to Sayyeda Zeinab, and attempted to destroy the collective history of Karbala. If you don&rsquo;t like what Hezbollah is doing in Syria, you better stay silent, or pretend to be happy and celebrate Assad&rsquo;s victory, like many others.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>You have no say in anything. Your ideas and way of life are not yours to shape or decide. You&rsquo;ve been occupied, conquered, and branded. You have no choice but to accept your destiny, and the omen of domination and power of those in charge of your life.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Resistance is a way of life.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It is a commitment and an identity. You are brought up to believe that without the Resistance, you would have been and will be defeated. Resistance is your family. You are not a person. You are a small part of a bigger picture, and you are not supposed to understand all the details. Leave that to the leadership. All you have to do is believe. You are nothing if you don&rsquo;t believe. Resistance defines you and makes you who you are. And it will take care of you; it will provide you with everything you need. All you have to do is give up, and give in.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Give in to Wilayat Al-Faqih. Give in to the death tornado in Lebanon, Syria, and Iraq. Give in to the wretchedness of everyone around you and question nothing &ndash; it&rsquo;s smoother that way. Rejoice in the signs of dominance. Rejoice in the victories &ndash; in Qusayr, Yabroud and Homs. Rejoice in death and blood, and you will be victorious.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Don&rsquo;t you crave the glory you&rsquo;ve heard about during every single Ashura since you were born? You will be given that glory, but it requires acquiescence. Stop asking questions. Forget about those bloody pictures of dead innocent Syrian children. Why don&rsquo;t you stop watching TV and reading papers altogether? Watch Al Manar TV and you will get the truth &ndash; the truth they need you to know &ndash; so that you can relax.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Forget about the small definitions of resistance. Think about the bigger picture: the dominance of the Shiites. Isn&rsquo;t that a glorious cause? Resistance is no more about Hezbollah&rsquo;s army fighting Israeli occupation. Forget about borders and states; these are details. Lebanon is not your ultimate homeland. Your community and your family are much bigger than that. Think of the Resistance as a longer and broader fight against everyone who wants to defeat you as a Shiite. Then you will understand that it is a fight for you, for your family and your community.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The Resistance is about the ultimate victory. You will have to accept the sacrifices, the death of friends and relatives. What is an individual death compared to the glory of the community? If you die for the bigger cause you will be called a hero, a martyr, and a champion. Yes, you will be forgotten after a few days and your family will suffer indefinitely, but that&rsquo;s okay, because you are nothing. You are a small but necessary sacrifice, and you should rejoice.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In the name of the Resistance, you must rejoice. Keep your fears and pains to yourself. Ignore those passing feelings of sympathy for the dead children of Syria. In the name of the Resistance, you should stop feeling. Think of yourself as a victim - a victim of a grand conspiracy theory that aims to kill all the Shiites in the world. Believe in the Resistance as your identity and way of life. Believe everything it tells you. Forget you are a thinking, feeling human being. It is easier that way.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As a Shiite, you are to believe that you are one of the chosen people. Believe, or you will be a traitor. It is not a choice. You are not free. Surrender your freedom. Surrender your life, and rejoice.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Hanin Ghaddar is the Managing Editor of NOW.

Usually the real challenge in most markets is that the investors don’t have their act together, the investors don’t take risks and the investors don’t know how to build their own ecosystems.”</p>
<p>Hearty applause followed these words, spoken by <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2F500hats.com%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNFPf5tKFNKDXXL99FXIVj2lE014vA" target="_blank">Dave McClure</a> in his keynote speech at <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.executive-magazine.com%2Fbuzz%2Farabnet-dubai-the-next-step&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNEhzs72M3n-cg3dlXmhb99PZWTbGQ" target="_blank">ArabNet’s Digital Summit in Dubai</a>. But he quickly added a caveat: “Investors aren’t the only ones to blame; entrepreneurs screw a lot of things up, too.”</p>
<p>McClure is an entrepreneur, angel investor and founding partner of global seed-stage venture capital fund and accelerator <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2F500.co%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNGSITNR7fBbWROl-S0FQQRBLhu_hA" target="_blank">500 Startups</a>. He is also behind the initiative <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fgeeksonaplane.com%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNE-m7Oci2q4pqDxml2fG_iFeurgyA" target="_blank">Geeks on a Plane</a>, which organizes international tours for startups, investors and executives to learn about and visit high-growth technology markets around the world.</p>
<p>McClure’s balanced statements pin investors and entrepreneurs as having equally important responsibilities to work toward the success of a company. But risk-averse investors need to play their game right — in his keynote, he went on to stress that a successful ecosystem requires early access to capital and early investor optimism.</p>
<p>He points to Estonia as a prime example, where early investors in Skype took a large risk very early. Though investing early does not always garner the same success across the board, McClure cites early optimism as a key factor that breeds trust in an ecosystem.</p>
<p>In the MENA, this optimism will likely have to come from regional investors. Panelists at ArabNet’s “What’s Hot in Web and Mobile” discussion agreed that foreign investors were somewhat skeptical of investing in regional internet companies because the region has yet to see a breakout hit. They were also doubtful of the companies’ ability to scale internationally, since many regional startups are copies of international counterparts. While this might attract regional venture capital because of startups’ proven business models, it limits their potential for international growth. VCs therefore need to encourage entrepreneurs to think globally. “Not just a blanket for this region, but something that will make fundamental global change,” said panelist Ben Parr of VC firm <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fangel.co%2Fdominatefund&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNHSWVKCyz2dAe3aIyWq8ucYRAFueA" target="_blank">DominateFund</a>.</p>
<p>Early optimism, however, appears to be lacking among MENA investors. And while there is a lot of money, regional investors are still too shy to take the kind of risks that could result in explosive success.</p>
<p>The dearth of optimism ends up killing both sides. Too little money for an entrepreneur, paired with large stakes of equity for a cautious and controlling investor can end up stifling a business rather than giving it space to flourish. “If you squeeze the entrepreneur out of equity, he will be demotivated and the [venture capital firm] becomes the owner, which lessens [the entrepreneur’s] chance to make a profit,” said Hervé Cuviliez, CEO of digital media company <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fcorp.diwanee.com%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNGoCFv4Ah5h54UL8Qs6RSlxSO_xkg" target="_blank">Diwanee</a>.</p>
<p>It seems that the region’s best option is to establish good practices among local investors. At a panel on “The Rise of the Big VC,” Habib Haddad, serial entrepreneur and CEO of <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.wamda.com&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNHBxhSzVohx5ll4jvxRM6mQ9Yi05Q" target="_blank">Wamda</a>, recognized some qualities that make for good investors. “A great VC invests and keeps injecting capital in the long run,” he said. VCs should make sure the financial needs of the entrepreneurs are met, such as finding follow-on funding, while leaving the entrepreneurs do their thing, he said, “not to own the entrepreneur.”</p>
