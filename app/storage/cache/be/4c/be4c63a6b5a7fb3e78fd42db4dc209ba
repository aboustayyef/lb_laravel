You know why? Cuz I met you, that’s why I’m OK.”</span></i></div><div><br></div><div><span><span><b>Review by Megora </b></span></span><br>To anyone familiar with Zooey Deschanel’s movie or music career, <i>New Girl </i>would at first appear to be purely a showcase for Deschanel’s quirkiness, especially with her signing up as producer from the get-go. But it soon turns out to be much more than that, mostly thanks to a talented cast that has great chemistry together (Deschanel, Jake Johnson, Max Greenfield, Lamorne Morris, Hannah Simone, and recently Damon Wayans Jr.), and the leadership of <i>New Girl</i>’s show-runner Elizabeth Meriwether, who openly admits that a lot of the inspiration behind the show’s storylines comes from her own personal life. The show’s premise may seem corny, especially with Deschanel playing a character that is decidedly her, but good execution and surprisingly great performances by the relatively unknown men of the show raise it to a whole other level. If Zooey was initially the hook for me to see the show, it is definitely the entire group that keeps me coming back.</div><div><br></div><div><span><b>Season 1</b></span></div><div>Instead of a New York café, a Los Angeles loft is where <i>New Girl</i> sets its scene and where Jessica “Jess” Day, just out of a long-term relationship, moves in with the three male occupants: “Schmidt”, the metrosexual ladies-man, still dealing with the insecurities of his former fat self; Winston Bishop, the former pro basketball player back from Latvia and trying to regain his bearings; and Nick Miller, the law school dropout, current bartender, wannabe writer, and resident cynic. A bonus addition also joins: Cece, Jess’s long-time best friend, a model, and almost her opposite in every way. The season basically served as an introduction to the characters, while building several plots around their professional and personal lives (Jess’s exploration of a new love life, Schmidt and Cece’s on-again off-again relationship, Nick’s cancer scare and him finally escaping the hold of his ex-girlfriend Caroline), and all the while drawing a realistic portrayal of modern-day people in their early thirties, struggling through love, friendships, careers, and growing up in general. But ultimately it all boiled down to the simple day-to-day interactions of the roommates, most notably between Jess and Nick, and that was largely due to their contradicting personalities: Jess always bubbly and emotional, Nick grouchy, untrusting, and simply angry about everything. This naturally led to lots of tension (some of it sexual) and lots of laughs. With a promising start, the outlook was bright for what the gang and their show-runner would do next.</div><div><br></div><div><b><span>Favorite Episode: Injured</span></b></div><div>Episode 15 of the season had the roommates bonding more than ever around Nick during his cancer scare, and with Jake Johnson going all out to expose a more vulnerable side to Nick himself as he evaluated his life so far.</div><div><br></div><div><b><span>Honorable Mentions: </span></b><br>Cece Crashes, The 23rd, The Landlord, Tomatoes, See Ya.</div><div><br><b><span>Megora Rating</span></b><br><span><b><span>B+</span></b></span></div><div><br></div><div><span><b>Season 2</b></span></div><div>If season one had covered a lot of ground around multiple characters and numerous guest stars, season two was definitely Jess/Nick-centric. Not many shows address the sexual tension between their leads so early in the game (fear of the <i>Moonlighting</i> curse has often been cited as a factor), but Liz Meriwether’s gamble to do just that throughout this season seemed to have paid off. Nick and Jess’s growing attraction and the chemistry between the two actors, brought some hilarious, endearing, and downright sexy moments to the show (who knew a visit to the hardware store could act as an aphrodisiac?), thoroughly satisfying ‘Ness’ shippers and making all other storylines pale in comparison. The ‘will they, won’t they’ back and forth culminated in the season finale, when Nick and Jess ended the not-yet-started relationship between them, then minutes later decided to take a chance on it anyway, despite the complications of their living arrangements and the fact that they’re both generally “scaredy cats” when it comes to serious commitments. The last scene of them driving away would definitely have been the ‘happily ever after’ ending in any other movie, but this is a TV series, which means the repercussions of the night’s decisions would have to be dealt with in the morning.</div><div><br></div><div><span><b>Favorite Episode: Cooler</b></span></div><div>Nick in a women’s trench-coat, Jess as a ‘cooler’, Schmidt playing the Cece-card to get with a girl, a game of Strip True American, a melon-face Nick mannequin, getting stuck behind an iron curtain, climbing out a fourth-story window, and the kiss heard around the world. You can’t beat that.</div><div><span><b><br></b></span></div><div><span><b>Honorable Mention:</b></span><br>Fluffer, Cabin, Pepperwood, Quick Hardening Caulk, Chicago, First Date, Virgins.</div><div><br><b><span>Megora Rating</span></b><br><span><b><span>A</span></b></span></div><br><div><b><span>Season 3</span></b></div><div>I won’t say it was the <i>Moonlighting</i> curse, but something definitely disrupted the flow of this show by the time the third season rolled in. I can’t tell if it was the disoriented feel behind Nick and Jess’s characters now that they were together, the downright “douchiness” of Schmidt after losing both his women and then just floundering about, or the exponentially-increasing craziness of Winston whom the writers still didn’t know what to do with. The only saving grace of the season was the return of Damon Wayans Jr.’s Coach (who had previously appeared in the pilot but had to depart because of his commitment to the now-cancelled <i>Happy Endings</i>), and is, as a Wayans, simply born to be funny. The season wrapped with Nick and Jess broken up, and what seemed like a full reset of the show (no cliffhangers, no pending storylines). This leaves plenty of room for Meriwether and her band of writers to reinvent themselves and bring the show back to its previous potential.</div><div><br></div><div><b><span>Favorite Episode: Prince</span></b></div><div>Words of wisdom, and a song, from Prince himself, need I say more?</div><div><br></div><div><span><b>Honorable Mentions: </b></span><br><span><b> </b></span>The Box, Coach, Clavado En Un Bar, Birthday, Exes.</div><div><br><span><b>Megora Rating</b></span><br><span><span><b>C+</b></span></span></div></div>";s:17:"post_image_height";i:900;s:16:"post_image_width";i:1600;s:11:"post_visits";i:9;s:18:"post_twitterShares";i:4;s:19:"post_facebookShares";i:12;s:16:"post_totalShares";i:16;s:16:"post_socialScore";i:20;s:13:"post_virality";i:22;s:9:"blog_name";s:13:"Nad's Reviews";s:16:"blog_description";s:72:"Nad's Reviews specializes in TV reviews as well as films and restaurants";s:8:"blog_url";s:27:"http://www.nadsreviews.com/";s:11:"blog_author";s:3:"Nad";s:28:"blog_author_twitter_username";s:11:"NadsReviews";s:13:"blog_rss_feed";s:54:"http://www.nadsreviews.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss";s:9:"blog_tags";s:18:"tv, culture, media";s:2:"id";i:162;s:11:"blog_active";i:1;s:24:"blog_last_post_timestamp";i:1405593540;s:6:"col_id";N;s:8:"col_name";N;s:16:"col_media_source";N;s:13:"col_home_page";N;s:13:"col_shorthand";N;s:26:"col_media_source_shorthand";N;s:27:"col_author_twitter_username";N;s:8:"col_tags";N;s:15:"col_description";N;s:23:"col_last_post_timestamp";N;}i:2;O:8:"stdClass":36:{s:7:"post_id";i:32677;s:8:"post_url";s:78:"http://www.nadsreviews.com/2014/07/a-snows-movie-review-dawn-of-planet-of.html";s:10:"post_title";s:54:"A.

Survive. Future.”</i></span></div><div><span><span><b><br></b></span></span></div><div><span><span><b>Review by A. Snow</b></span></span><br>The sequel to 2011’s <b>Rise of the Planet of the Apes</b>, <i>Dawn</i> begins after a decade has passed since its predecessor. The audience is immediately thrown into the apes’ daily lives – hunting, gathering, learning – living peacefully within the Muir woods. Caesar, still in command, is also now a father of two sons: Blue Eyes, and a newborn. Koba stands as Caesar’s second in command and is also one of the film’s antagonists.</div><div><br></div><div>Matt Reeves, the film’s director, does a wonderful job weaving together the complex narrative, all the while giving the audience a range of beautiful visual sequences. I for one have missed films that intermix stylistic techniques within a narrative without losing sight of either. Reeves uses two long takes (a rarity in current films) and they are both astounding; one is more complex seeing as how it is a 360 degree long take that spins around three times during a single battle sequence. Like I said, I am in awe!</div><div><br></div><div>The film’s motion capture work is just mind-blowing. The level that this technology has progressed to is frightening. Usually the main complaint in regards to motion-capture and CGI animation is the lack of emotions when it comes to the eyes…well ladies and gentlemen <i>Dawn</i>’s Apes emoted to the point of bringing me to tears. We must give credit (and hope for an eventual Oscar Nomination) to the brilliant actors that portrayed the apes in the film. From Caesar to Maurice to Blue Eyes to Koba, they were all fantastic. </div><div><br></div><div>The film would be nothing without its story. I must commend the writers for continuing this re-telling in less of a sci-fi way, and with a more realistic and genuine approach. Compared to the first film, the humans were <b>much</b> more layered. Every character had a purpose and they each delivered. Running almost two hours and fifteen minutes, I personally loved every minute that passed. <span><b>SPOILERS</b></span> - The parallels between Caesar and Koba’s relationship to that of Julius Caesar and Brutus was one of my favorite aspects of the storyline. The moment where Caesar looked at Koba before the betrayal was perfection<b> - </b><span><b>SPOILERS</b></span></div><div><br></div><div><span><b>Conclusion</b></span></div><div>With beautiful mise-en-scene, cinematography, sound, and editing, I am so beyond satisfied with this film and cannot wait for the final act.  I hope <i>Dawn </i>gets the nominations it deserves once the Oscars come around. </div><div><br></div><div><span><b>A.Snow Rating</b></span></div><div><span><span><b>A+</b></span></span></div></div></div>";s:17:"post_image_height";i:635;s:16:"post_image_width";i:1238;s:11:"post_visits";i:3;s:18:"post_twitterShares";i:0;s:19:"post_facebookShares";i:3;s:16:"post_totalShares";i:3;s:16:"post_socialScore";i:8;s:13:"post_virality";i:9;s:9:"blog_name";s:13:"Nad's Reviews";s:16:"blog_description";s:72:"Nad's Reviews specializes in TV reviews as well as films and restaurants";s:8:"blog_url";s:27:"http://www.nadsreviews.com/";s:11:"blog_author";s:3:"Nad";s:28:"blog_author_twitter_username";s:11:"NadsReviews";s:13:"blog_rss_feed";s:54:"http://www.nadsreviews.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss";s:9:"blog_tags";s:18:"tv, culture, media";s:2:"id";i:162;s:11:"blog_active";i:1;s:24:"blog_last_post_timestamp";i:1405593540;s:6:"col_id";N;s:8:"col_name";N;s:16:"col_media_source";N;s:13:"col_home_page";N;s:13:"col_shorthand";N;s:26:"col_media_source_shorthand";N;s:27:"col_author_twitter_username";N;s:8:"col_tags";N;s:15:"col_description";N;s:23:"col_last_post_timestamp";N;}i:3;O:8:"stdClass":36:{s:7:"post_id";i:32658;s:8:"post_url";s:84:"http://speaktheblues.blogspot.com/2014/07/blues-with-soul-trouble-blues-charles.html";s:10:"post_title";s:48:"Blues With Soul: 'Trouble Blues' - Charles Brown";s:10:"post_image";s:101:"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-caxLqhsenaY/UrBXg0ietGI/AAAAAAAAJHw/tNcarb2XG8k/s1600/charles-brown-jpg.jpg";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:123:"Charles Brown was a blues ballad singer and pianist, and was a key transitional figure between 1940's cool jazz-influenc...";s:7:"blog_id";s:13:"speaktheblues";s:14:"post_timestamp";i:1405237560;s:12:"post_content";s:1247:"<br><div><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-caxLqhsenaY/UrBXg0ietGI/AAAAAAAAJHw/tNcarb2XG8k/s1600/charles-brown-jpg.jpg" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-caxLqhsenaY/UrBXg0ietGI/AAAAAAAAJHw/tNcarb2XG8k/s1600/charles-brown-jpg.jpg" height="400" width="322"></a></div><br><br><div>Charles Brown was a blues ballad singer and pianist, and was a key transitional figure between 1940's cool jazz-influenced R&B and rock 'n' roll. </div><div><br></div><div>He performed almost non-stop from the 40's up until his death in 1999; his music was also featured many times in the Billboard R&B charts.

<p><strong><span>When <em>Rise of the Planet of the Apes </em>came out in 2011, no one was actually expecting it to be any good. Boy were we wrong.<i> </i>The film was not only good; it was brilliant. Thanks to state-of-the-art motion capture technology, as well as a compelling narrative with something to say about society, the <em>Planet of the Apes </em>universe was given a new lease on life. But we all know how challenging it can be to craft a good sequel, let alone a superior one, which is why I was completely blown away by <em>Dawn of the Planet of the Apes.</em> Not only is it a spectacular science fiction film, it’s one of the greatest and most impressive sequels I have ever had the privilege of witnessing. </span></strong></p>
<p><span>It’s been ten years since the deadly Gen-Sys virus was unleashed, and humanity is on the brink of extinction. Meanwhile, Caesar (Andy Serkis) and his trusted band of apes have been flourishing. It’s been years since they’ve crossed a human, and they’ve taken that opportunity to develop their own society and way of life. They have their rules, and Caesar makes sure they’re abided by. When a small band of humans accidentally stumbles upon the apes’ forest home, the peace that Caesar has fought so hard to maintain becomes increasingly fragile, especially when his trusted friend Koba (Toby Kebbell) begins to take matters into his own hands.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://ageeksblogdotcom1.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/1280-dawn-planet-apes.jpg"><img src="http://ageeksblogdotcom1.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/1280-dawn-planet-apes.jpg?w=650&h=364" alt="1280-dawn-planet-apes"></a></p>
<p><span>I was completely floored by <em>Dawn of the Planet of the Apes </em>from beginning to end. For one, Andy Serkis is simply flawless as Caesar. Seriously, where’s this man’s Academy Award? The way he inhabits the role of Caesar and makes the audience care for him more than they do for humanity is miraculous, to say the least. But it’d be a disservice to every other motion capture performer to only highlight Serkis’ amazing work. Toby Kebbell is equally brilliant as Koba, and serves as one of the film’s most interesting characters, with legitimate motivations for his actions. Karin Konoval is great as the lovable Maurice, my personal favorite ape, and I wish I could tear through the screen and give that CGI ape a big cuddly hug. Seriously, props to every single mo-cap performer for their amazing work.</span></p>
<p><span>That mo-cap would mean zilch if it weren’t for Weta Digital’s picture-perfect visual effects work, and they are more impressive than ever this time around. There are more apes on screen at once than ever before, and they all look incredible and unique. It’s the kind of visual effects work that continuously impresses you as the film goes on, and not once did I come close to feeling jaded. The Academy Award for best visual effects is already in the bag.</span></p>
<p><span><a href="https://ageeksblogdotcom1.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/dawn-of-the-planet-of-the-apes-1.jpg"><img src="http://ageeksblogdotcom1.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/dawn-of-the-planet-of-the-apes-1.jpg?w=650&h=345" alt="Dawn-of-the-Planet-of-the-Apes-1"></a> </span></p>
<p><span>It would be easy to simply recommend the film based on its technical achievements, but it’s so much more than just pretty effects. Director Matt Reeves, who stepped into the director’s chair after Rupert Wyatt left the project, was the perfect choice to helm this sequel. This is a much darker story than the previous one, and although it doesn’t have the same allegorical aspirations that <em>Rise </em>had, it has a lot to say about human nature, and more importantly, knowing who to trust, even if it’s the unpopular choice. </span></p>
<p><span>The film’s action sequences are some of the most impressive I’ve seen in years; they’re violent, often scary, and extremely visceral. There’s one continuous shot in particular that involves a tank, and it’s hauntingly beautiful. Reeves has really outdone himself here. The film’s score is equally haunting and brilliant, and makes the film even more awe-inspiring than it already is.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://ageeksblogdotcom1.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/dawn-of-the-planet-of-the-apes-pics-6.jpg"><img src="http://ageeksblogdotcom1.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/dawn-of-the-planet-of-the-apes-pics-6.jpg?w=650&h=340" alt="XXX DAWN-PLANET-APES-MOV-JY-3806-.JPG A ENT"></a></p>
<p><span>My one complaint about the film would be that the human characters are a bit one-dimensional. It’s not a major issue, but it does stand out, especially when the apes have been so well fleshed-out. Still, Jason Clarke and Gary Oldman’s characters manage to shine as leaders with polar-opposite views, and they’re the only human characters that really register. Keri Russell, I’m sad to say, is wasted in a thinly written role. But don’t fret, the film’s focus is largely on the apes, and it’s immensely immersive and satisfying.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>The Verdict:</span></strong></p>
<p><span><em>Dawn of the Planet of the Apes </em>is hands down one of the greatest sequels I have ever watched. It’s an emotional and visually breathtaking ride that will you leave you in awe and clamoring for more. Go watch it. Don’t make me beg.</span></p>

I couldn’t be more surprised to be honest. After 7 movies and Tim Burton’s crappy remake, the series has been milked hard, it’s a wonder there’s still room for surprises. Anyway, what I’m saying is that “Dawn”made a monkey out of me. I was certain it would suck. Instead, the movie rises and offers an incredible visual experience in glorious 3D. No more guys squeezed into monkey suits. Performance-capture makes everything seem fresh. To watch what actor Andy Serkis does as Caesar, the lead ape from “Rise of the Planet of the Apes”, is to witness a kind of miracle. In fact, Serkis gives by far one of the best performances in the movie, and he is right there on set, acting alongside Jason Clarke, Kerri Russell and the great Gary Oldman. Caesar’s tribe now lives in the woods, a decade after the events of the previous movie. Humans have been wiped out as a result of the deadly virus. Except they haven’t, at least not entirely. When a group of humans enters the woods, hoping to restart the power plant for a community of survivors living in the abandoned city, their leader (Clarke) manages to convince Caesar that they mean them no harm. Things eventually go wrong, as they should, but to reveal more would be unthinkable. And yet, none of this would matter if the apes, chimps and gorillas weren’t so incredibly convincing. These performance-capture roles are remarkable and they are the backbone of the story. Whine all you want about the cheesy acting of the humans, the shameless tearjerking in the script by Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver, and the predictable storyline. Solid points for sure. Just wait. As soon as Caesar appears onscreen, you’ll be hooked. Credit director Matt Reeves for making the most of this opportunity and scoring an absolute bull’s-eye. Still, the real story of this film is written in Caesar’s eyes. The images of him as a leader are iconic, and Serkis makes the idea of yet another sequel seem promising, instead of dreadful. I’d follow this ape anywhere.</p>

The R-rated comedy hit added an additional 5,276 admissions and cracked the 30K mark, reaching 30,513 total admissions so far. It only dropped by 18% compared to last weekend. </span></strong></p>
<p><span><em><span><a href="https://ageeksblog.com/2014/06/02/movie-review-maleficent-2014/">Maleficent</a></span> </em>also held tight in second place, selling 3,900 tickets for a mind-bending tally of 74,557 admissions. That’s pretty much twice as many tickets sold as <em>X:Men Days of Future Past.</em> Who’d have thunk it?</span></p>
<p><span><em><span><a href="https://ageeksblog.com/2014/06/23/movie-review-think-like-a-man-too-2014/">Think Like a Man Too</a></span> </em>actually climbed to the third spot this week with 2,852 admissions. That’s a slim 21% drop from last weekend, and suggests that the film is receiving some positive word-of-mouth, despite middling reviews. </span></p>
<p><span>In fourth place, <em><span><a href="https://ageeksblog.com/2014/06/08/movie-review-the-fault-in-our-stars-2014/">The Fault in Our Stars</a> </span></em>continued its impressive box office run, and sold 2,605 tickets over the weekend to raise its total to 33,400 admissions after four weeks. </span></p>
<p><span>New horror release <em><span><a href="http://tlkabtmovies.com/2014/07/03/deliver-us-from-evil-2014/">Deliver Us From Evil</a> </span></em>failed to get much traction from a relatively wide release, and landed in fifth place with 2,478 admissions. The film’s director, Scott Derrickson, has been tapped to direct Marvel’s upcoming adaptation of Dr. Strange.</span></p>
<p><span>Two other new releases opened outside of the top ten, but were released in only a handful of theaters. <em>Gladiator of Rome </em>managed to sell 486 tickets out of six theaters, while <em>The Raid 2 </em>pulled in 254 moviegoers out of just three.</span></p>

If you ask me, the light's winning."</span></i></div><div><br></div><div><i>True Detective</i> isn't feel good television, but it's an undoubtedly necessary and powerful piece of filmmaking. The show's first season is a dark and deeply disturbing tale that spans the course of eight episodes with a clear end and beginning. The fact that the show possesses an anthology format (much like <i>American Horror Story</i>), means it can tell a self-contained story every year with a new premise and a fresh set of characters. You'd think this approach would lend itself well to easy viewing, but <i>True Detective</i> is far from an "easy show" to watch. It's uncompromising and ominous, yet it's also packed with first rate production and performances that make it highly recommended. </div><div><br></div><div>The most intriguing aspect of <i>True Detective</i> is the fact that it utilizes two separate time-frames while unraveling two detectives and their hunt for a serial killer in Louisiana across seventeen years. Beginning with a gruesome murder in the pilot, <i>Detective</i> doesn't let up all the way through the finale, tackling a number of complex themes (the nature of man, religion, and the universe) in the process. The series  received widespread critical acclaim over the past few months and it's easy to see why; the show is not only impeccably written and cast, it's gorgeously shot against the backdrop of Louisiana's lush landscapes. </div><div><br></div><div>The show's greatest success is most certainly Matthew McConaughey's astounding performance. As Detective Rust Cohle, Matthew assumes the role of the lifetime, and he's every bit up for the challenge. His character operates in a sort of perpetual existential crisis, and Matthew knocks every one of Rust's memorable monologues out of the park. The detective's offbeat view of the world is often perplexing but consistently thought-provoking, and his journey eventually culminates in one heck of an award-worthy speech (one of the finest moments of TV I've watched all year). </div><div><br></div><div>Less effective is Woody Harrelson as Detective Marty Hart. I found the character unlikeable for a great deal of the time, and Harrelson never really felt like he was elevating the material the way McConaughey was. Nevertheless, Marty's dynamic with Rust provided a strong backbone for the show, and evolved in a realistic and organic manner. As for the rest of the cast, Michelle Monaghan was a definite standout as Marty's frustrated wife. Although her role became less integral as the show progressed, she continued to provide a compelling counterbalance to the show's grislier moments.</div><div><br><span><b>Rust Remarks</b></span><br><br>Rust: Maybe the honorable thing for our species to do is deny our programming, stop reproducing, walk hand in hand into extinction, one last midnight - brothers and sisters opting out of a raw deal.<br><br>Rust: People incapable of guilt, usually do have a good time.<br><br>Ruse: I can't say the job made me this way. More like me being this way made me right for the job.<br><br>Rust: I know who I am. And after all these years, there’s a victory in that.<br><br>Rust: If you get the opportunity, you should kill yourself.<br><br>Rust: All the dick swagger you roll, you can't spot crazy pussy? <br><br>Rust: Get on out of here, you're classin' the place up. <br><br>Rust: If the only thing keeping a person decent, is the expectation of divine reward, then, brother, that person is a piece of shit. <br><br>Rust: This place is like somebody's memory of a town, and the memory is fading. It's like there was never anything here but jungle.<br>Martin Hart: Stop saying shit like that. It's unprofessional. <br><br>Rust: The world needs bad men. We keep the other bad men from the door.<br><br>Rust: Life's barely long enough to get good at one thing. So be careful what you get good at.<br><br></div><div><span><b>Conclusion</b></span></div><div><i>True Detective</i> is an unsettling, atmostpheric, and remarkably absorbing series.</div><div><span><b>Nad Rating</b></span></div><div><span><span><b>A</b></span></span></div></div>";s:17:"post_image_height";i:900;s:16:"post_image_width";i:1600;s:11:"post_visits";i:7;s:18:"post_twitterShares";i:1;s:19:"post_facebookShares";i:13;s:16:"post_totalShares";i:14;s:16:"post_socialScore";i:18;s:13:"post_virality";i:21;s:9:"blog_name";s:13:"Nad's Reviews";s:16:"blog_description";s:72:"Nad's Reviews specializes in TV reviews as well as films and restaurants";s:8:"blog_url";s:27:"http://www.nadsreviews.com/";s:11:"blog_author";s:3:"Nad";s:28:"blog_author_twitter_username";s:11:"NadsReviews";s:13:"blog_rss_feed";s:54:"http://www.nadsreviews.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss";s:9:"blog_tags";s:18:"tv, culture, media";s:2:"id";i:162;s:11:"blog_active";i:1;s:24:"blog_last_post_timestamp";i:1405593540;s:6:"col_id";N;s:8:"col_name";N;s:16:"col_media_source";N;s:13:"col_home_page";N;s:13:"col_shorthand";N;s:26:"col_media_source_shorthand";N;s:27:"col_author_twitter_username";N;s:8:"col_tags";N;s:15:"col_description";N;s:23:"col_last_post_timestamp";N;}i:10;O:8:"stdClass":36:{s:7:"post_id";i:32500;s:8:"post_url";s:86:"http://monkyseemonkydo.com/2014/07/09/•the-head-and-the-heart•rivers-and-roads•/";s:10:"post_title";s:47:"•The Head and the Heart•Rivers and Roads•";s:10:"post_image";s:76:"http://monkyseemonkydo.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/noise_theheadtheheart.jpg";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:123:" Filed under: I breathe music Tagged: Beirut, dubai, Indie, middle east, music, music blog, rivers and roads, song of t...";s:7:"blog_id";s:15:"monkyseemonkydo";s:14:"post_timestamp";i:1404901140;s:12:"post_content";s:325:" Filed under: I breathe music Tagged: Beirut, dubai, Indie, middle east, music, music blog, rivers and roads, song of the day, The Head and the Heart, UAE, USA<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=monkyseemonkydo.com&blog=36366745&post=3217&subd=monkyseemonkydo&ref=&feed=1" width="1" height="1">";s:17:"post_image_height";i:386;s:16:"post_image_width";i:570;s:11:"post_visits";i:3;s:18:"post_twitterShares";i:0;s:19:"post_facebookShares";i:0;s:16:"post_totalShares";i:0;s:16:"post_socialScore";i:4;s:13:"post_virality";i:2;s:9:"blog_name";s:15:"monkyseemonkydo";s:16:"blog_description";s:243:"Dietitian and Enthusiast from Lebanon living in Dubai..

<p>A month ago on Project Revolver, Rani The First wrote a piece entitled “<strong><a href="http://projectrevolver.org/2014/05/24/5-badass-jazz-tracks-thatll-rock-hard-2/">5 Badass Jazz Tracks That’ll Rock You Hard”.</a></strong></p>
<p>In a sort of a friendly rivalry response, I present to you the acoustic version!</p>
<p>As the well planned pun in title, the jazz genre ‘hard bop’ is what it sounds like; music meant for you to bop your head e tito! Hard bop, the successor to the bebop genre (which was mostly associated with Charlie “Bird” Parker and Dizzy Gillespie) was rooted more in the Blues, and the chord changes were made simpler and had more emphasis on the vamp or the main ‘riff’.</p>
<p>This jazz movement was mostly prevailent from the early 1950’s to the mid 1960’s, with its champions being Art Blakey, Hank Mobley, Miles Davis, Horace Silver, and many more. The legendary jazz label Blue Note Records was the home of hard bop for many years.</p>
<p>So here we go, bop it!</p>

I thought I smelled special."</span></i></div><div><br></div><div>It's funny - I've been begging <i>True Blood </i>to kill off characters for years now, and while the writers seem to have gotten all trigger-happy this season, I'm still not satisfied. I guess the show's problems are bigger than I thought.</div><div><br></div><div>Alcide was always a void. It boggles my mind that he's been with the show since the third season and he's still <b>so</b> devoid of a personality. The writers failed to make him a relevant character at every turn; instead, he always felt like a plot contrivance that could be conveniently inserted into the story whenever needed. Even his relationship with Sookie was mismanaged, as their coupling mostly happened off-screen and thus garnered very little emotional investment from the audience. All of these reasons contributed to his death being a tremendously unemotional and vacant affair. I literally rolled my eyes as Joe Manganiello's final scene unfolded, and I doubt that's what the writers were going for. </div><div><br></div><div>Much more successful was the return of Sarah Newlin, one of <i>True Blood'</i>s greatest villains. I've always adored Anna Camp's performance on the show, and bringing her back for the final season is definitely a decision I can root for. In addition, making her a target of the Yakimono corporation  effectively brings the show full circle, as the fashabcks revealed that the Tru Blood manufacturers targeted Eric in the past. I wasn't exactly on the edge of my seat as Mr. Northman was faced with the decision of saving either Pam or Sylvie's life, but it's always good when Alexander Skarsgard gets some screentime, particularly when he gets to bond with Kristin Bauer (Pam). More of these two please.<br><br>And finally, it must be reiterated that Sookie is still a horrible, <b>horrible</b> protagonist. I can't remember the last time a show had such an unlikeable and idiotic lead character. I hate to say it, but it really is time for <i>True Blood </i>to come to an end. What's left of its legacy depends on it.<br><br></div><div><span><b>Bloody Bits</b></span></div><div><br></div><div>- Always awesome to see Nan Flanagan again. She reminds me of the show's glory days.</div><div><br></div><div>- Funny moment: Sookie's "I have a boyfriend" to Bill while sucking his blood.</div><div><br></div><div>- Does anyone care about LaFayette and James' budding relationship? Didn't think so. </div><div><br></div><div>- Honestly I was more shocked by Miss Fortenberry's death than Alcide's demise. I'll surely miss her more because she was consistently funny in all her appearances. Thanks for nothing Violet. But hey, at least Hoyt's mama got to shoot Jessica before getting her heart ripped out. </div><div><br></div><div>- Painfully boring scene with the Reverend and Willa. Why do these two even have a storyline?<br><br></div><div>- How fantastic was it to see Eric regain his drive after Pam revealed Sarah Newlin was alive?</div><div><br></div><div>- I kind of wish Sarah's yogi wasn't killed off so soon. Watching the two endless bond over double orgasms would have been hilarious. </div><div><br></div><div>- The final fight was pretty fast-paced with a ton of exploding vamps and Sookie getting splattered with blood. Whenever Sookie suffers, I'm happy. </div><div><br></div><div>- Haunting moment for Andy as he refuses to call the ambulance at the end. It would do the show good to give serious material instead of the usual lighthearted fare.  </div><div><span><b><br></b></span></div><div><span><b>True Quips </b></span></div><div><br></div><div>Pam: I am as big a fan of the French vagina as you are Eric, but come back to Earth. She's just a human.</div><div><br></div><div>Eric: For more than a thousand years the world has been my oyster...

In “Mr. Morgan’s Last Love”, he plays an aging widower who lives in Paris. Having lost his beloved wife three years ago, he lives alone now, drowning in silent grief. Then one day, he meets Pauline (a charming Clémence Poésy), a young dance instructor. The two begin an unusual friendship that fills him with spirit. The movie itself, written and directed by Sandra Nettelbeck, is so light a whisper could blow it away. But acting this rich and touching is too good to resist. It’s fitting that Michael Caine (Sir Michael since the queen wisely knighted him in 2000)  is cast here as an aging widower. It’s a setup for life lessons and he makes the most of it. Director Sandra Nettelbeck doesn’t dodge the cheesy traps in her own script. But Caine does. Blending humor and heartbreak in a performance that makes a small movie a richly satisfying one, Caine truly is magic. The movie would be literally nothing without him.</p>

The iron fist/heel rule of power is an outdated concept that only shows the worst part of humanity.<br><br>While everyone is freaking out (not that I blame them), keep in mind that all the regional and international powers all have some interest in such a group existing, as it causes harm to one of the rival governments in some way.<br><br>Let's take a quick step back in history; below are three case studies (out of hundreds) about how music has stood up against the tyrannic laws and leaders:<br><br><br><b><u>1. THE BLUES</u></b><br><br><br><div><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-c6VqAXezfVw/U7jtN38g7DI/AAAAAAAACrs/q0nBQTRT3Ms/s1600/mississippi-blues-band_475.jpg" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-c6VqAXezfVw/U7jtN38g7DI/AAAAAAAACrs/q0nBQTRT3Ms/s1600/mississippi-blues-band_475.jpg"></a></div><br><div><br></div><div>When you think of the blues, you think about misfortune, betrayal and regret. You lose your job, you get the blues. Your loved one falls out of love with you, you get the blues. Your dog dies, you get the blues. While blues lyrics often deal with personal adversity, the music itself goes far beyond self-pity.</div><div><br></div><div>The blues has deep roots in American history, particularly African-American history. The blues originated on Southern plantations in the 19th Century. Its inventors were slaves, ex-slaves and the descendants of slaves - African-American sharecroppers who sang as they toiled in the cotton and vegetable fields. It's generally accepted that the music evolved from African spirituals, African chants, work songs and field hollers. </div><div><br></div><div>The blues was instrumental in what lead to the civil rights movement, that allowed African-Americans equal rights as everyone else in the land of the free, by sparking social consciousness with the message of the music that spread out from the South and found it's way to the entire world.</div><div><br></div><br><b><u>2.
