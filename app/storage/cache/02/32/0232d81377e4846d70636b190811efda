The Dubai Financial Market — home of the <a href="http://www.executive-magazine.com/business-finance/finance/market-crash-and-burn" target="_blank">Arabtec scandal</a> that triggered a <a href="http://www.executive-magazine.com/business-finance/finance/arabtec-dubai-market-fall-from-grace" target="_blank">pummelling of markets</a> over the previous weeks — saw its benchmark index advance 4.2 percent amid trading volumes of more than 1 billion shares in three sessions, far above its 50-day average.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.executive-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/20140707-indices-week-27.png"><img src="http://www.executive-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/20140707-indices-week-27.png" alt="Stock index performance" width="300" height="522"></a></p>
<p>On the Qatar Exchange, the index gain was even higher at 4.7 percent and in Abu Dhabi, the uptrend was 2.3 percent. Both exchanges saw higher volumes on the first three days of July when compared with daily volumes in the previous two weeks.</p>
<p>Other markets in the Middle East and North Africa displayed index fluctuations of lesser intensity but with a preponderance of gains; the only drops, at 0.3, 0.5 and 0.5 percent, were registered in Bahrain, Beirut and Morocco.</p>
<p><strong><strong>Shopping for confidence</strong></strong></p>
<p>Dubai closed the week marginally better than 20 percent down from its May 14 peak, allowing definition purists a new round of debate whether the recent downturn constitutes a bear market. Arabtec, whose board ventured to reassure investors and observers in a rare press conference on July 2, recovered at least somewhat from the onslaught of doubts that had almost erased the stock’s year-to-date price gains by its June 30 close. While still deeply wounded and having much trust yet to restore, the company showed a net weekly gain of 13.5 percent in the week.</p>
<p>In mature stock exchanges, when the going gets tough, the tough — meaning informed investors with enough cash on hand and a contrarian strategy — tend to go shopping. In the Dubai setting, the maxim seems to read a bit differently: when trust is in doubt, announce a mall. The latest big news aiming to boost trust in the emirate was an elaboration of the Mall of the World project in the Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum City megaproject, named after Dubai’s ruler and majority shareholder in the Dubai Holding company that owns the mall project.</p>
<p>According to a July 5 <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dubaiholding.com%2Fmedia-centre%2Fpress-releases%2F2014%2F407-mohammed-bin-rashid-launches-mall-of-the-world-a-temperature-controlled-pedestrian-city-in-dubai&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNFzSeibaNZCbldw0ucxk_HTPwjHeg" target="_blank">press statement</a> by Dubai Holding, the new mall will be the world’s largest, at 8 million square feet (743,000 square meters) but that is not the big news. The mall will be embedded into “the world’s first temperature-controlled city,” the announcement said. This 4.5 million square meter project will be located along Sheikh Zayed Road in Dubai. Temperature control will apparently be achieved via a protective cover, namely “a glass dome that will be open during the winter months.” Cost and implementation timeline of the venture were not included in the statement.</p>
<p>It was not all malls that spelled potential for new market boosts in the region, though. Tadawul, the Saudi bourse, saw the TASI climb 1.2 percent — perhaps with a whiff of optimism from neighbor markets but entirely without a new entry into the books for breaking new construction records. Toward the end of the week, the Saudi market was invigorated by second quarter results news, highlighted by petrochemicals giant Saudi Basic Industries Co’s (SABIC) dividend announcement of SAR 2.5 ($0.67) per share for the first half in 2013 that represented an increase of SAR 0.5 from the same period in 2013. Other better-than-anticipated results for the second quarter came from Saudi Hollandi Bank, Riyad Bank and dairy producer Almarai after the week’s market close.</p>
<p><strong><strong>Egypt’s budget</strong></strong></p>
<p>In the region’s most populous country, Egypt, week 27 brought a couple of upward sessions to the Egyptian Exchange after the government announced an austerity budget containing what was described as a planned deficit equal to 10 percent of GDP for the new fiscal year 2014–15, which started on July 1.</p>
<p>Reuters <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fuk.reuters.com%2Farticle%2F2014%2F06%2F29%2Fuk-egypt-budget-approval-idUKKBN0F40UF20140629&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNFXCbmPAYKc-iYZ7Rl6xJOIE9TtZQ" target="_blank">cited</a> a statement saying that Egypt’s planned deficit would be EGP 240 billion ($33.5 billion) after a reduction from EGP 292 billion ($40.8 billion) in an earlier budget draft that was rejected by President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi. The World Bank <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fdata.worldbank.org%2Fcountry%2Fegypt-arab-republic&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNEHQf8nteX-ku0p6JbwRoRH_rDCQQ" target="_blank">estimated Egypt’s GDP was $272 billion</a> in 2013.</p>
<p>The new budget’s EGP 52 billion deficit reduction was to be achieved by a combination of subsidy cuts and higher taxes, some of which were announced during the week. Tax increases include levies on capital gains and stock dividends, along with efforts to tax Egypt-based companies and professionals who incur revenues outside of the country. The bulk of savings, however, is to be realized via lowering of subsidies for diesel fuel and electricity.</p>
<p>Minister of Finance Hani Qadri Demian <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sis.gov.eg%2FEn%2FTemplates%2FArticles%2FtmpArticleNews.aspx%3FArtID%3D78623%23.U7qkf_mSzXw&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNHg_3-Y-H54A9CLwZD5GBWvNhculQ" target="_blank">announced</a> that Egypt aims for annual economic growth rates of 4 to 5.8 percent in the three fiscal years ending in June 2018, up from an expected growth of 3.2 percent in the just-started fiscal year, according to the country’s State Information Service.</p>
<p>Most notable news pertaining to the Beirut Stock Exchange was a reminder that the BSE has been slated for transformation into a joint stock company and gradual privatization under the <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bdl.gov.lb%2Flaws%2Findex%2F5%2F32%2FLaws.html&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNFSlvcc4UvAVjdtB4w5_kMinhQ50A" target="_blank">2011 Capital Markets Law</a>. This reminder was based on remarks by central bank governor Riad Salameh at a conference in June, but unfortunately came in the form of a haplessly transcribed, non-fact-checked and very carelessly edited interview of BSE vice president Ghaleb Mahmassani by an English-language Beirut daily.</p>

<p>Some restaurants airing the games had indeed noticed lesser volume of people since the start Ramadan, compared to the first week of the game, as people tend to eat more at home during the first week of the month. While admitting that their venues in Verdun and Hamra were less busy than the first week of the games, Rita Saati, marketing officer at Roadster Group, says their other locations compensated for this and they didn’t have a major cumulative decrease in sales or volume, making them satisfied with their venues’ performance during the World Cup thus far.</p>
<p>Most bars and clubs in Beirut are experiencing the annual slump that comes with the onset of the Ramadan when many practicing Muslims abstain from drinking alcohol. Yet the World Cup games, especially as the competition intensifies, are drawing out more crowds than usual for this period. Toni Rizk says his bars, Gatsby and Nu, were fully booked for the Germany–France game, but says that Uruguay Street as a whole had been less busy since the onset of Ramadan — which he says was expected, while the suicide bombings caused the typical decrease in customers on the nights they occurred.</p>
<p>While the semifinals and finals may bring crowds to Beirut’s bars despite Ramadan, it is to be noted, however, that the owners Executive spoke with say the increase in footfall that the World Cup brings to their venues has not translated into an increase in revenues, and that they usually just break even during the World Cup period, considering the investment they put into getting the broadcasting equipment and rights.</p>
<p>Shisha-serving cafes, which usually fill up during Ramadan — and even moreso now that people have football to watch as well — are examples of venues able to capitalize on the World Cup–Ramadan overlap.</p>
<p>Raouche’s Dardashat Café boasts a waiting list for the 11:00 pm games from now until final game, while for Beb El Az in Verdun, the World Cup period is the fullest they have been since opening three months ago. “We fully returned the investment we put into the World Cup during the first period and made a name for ourselves as the destination in Verdun thanks to the games,” says Bilal Daouk, Bab El Az’s manager on duty, explaining that people like to come after the evening <em>iftar</em> meal, have a shisha and watch the game on the giant screen on their wide terrace.</p>
<p>Ramadan or not, explosions or not, it seems that the Lebanese are determined to enjoy what is left of the 2014 World Cup — and hospitality venues are just as determined to make a profit during this holy season.</p>

The best gainer of all MENA stock markets in the 26th week of the year was Kuwait’s KSE Index, which advanced all of 0.6 percent, followed by a 0.4 upward nudge in Oman’s MSM 30.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.executive-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/20140702-indices-week-26.png"><img src="http://www.executive-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/20140702-indices-week-26.png" alt="Market performance week 26" width="300" height="522"></a></p>
<p>Across the region, the last trading week before the start of Ramadan was a reminder that equity plays are absolutely no guarantors of rewards in life. From Doha to Casablanca, market investors had to contend with a second consecutive week of index impairments, but for participants in the Dubai Financial Market this remainder struck home in form of a big bad bang as the DFM General Index not only dropped 8.1 percent on the week but also closed the second quarter below 4,000 points on June 30.</p>
<p>In continuing the index losses of the two previous weeks, this meant that the DFM GI closed the second quarter 11.4 percent lower than its value at the end of March, signifying the index’s first harsh quarterly drop since getting on a speedy growth train in the middle of 2012.</p>
<p>In the half-year statistics, Dubai thus dropped to second best climber behind the Egyptian Exchange, whose EGX 30 index ended the first six months in 2014 with a 22.1 percent gain, 2.5 percentage points ahead of the DFM GI. Most other MENA markets ended the period also with gains, with other high risers being Bahrain with 19.4 percent, Qatar with 15.5 percent and Saudi Tadawul with 13.1 percent. At the low end, the Tunisian and Moroccan bourses advanced 5.7 and 4.4 percent. Only the Kuwaiti bourse closed H1 lower, by 4.2 percent when compared with the start of 2014.</p>
<p>For reference, the data pages of index maker MSCI said that its Emerging Markets Index achieved a first-half gain of 4.8 percent in terms of price, while the combined performance of Emerging and Frontier Markets stood at 5.3 percent.</p>
<p><strong>Fall from grace</strong></p>
<p>But even as the regional statistics for the year to date are still impressive in the context of emerging and frontier markets, the recent drop of the DFM GI was as painful as it was embarrassing.</p>
<p>Painful, because the story of the sharp correction in the DFM last month was a reminder that the UAE equities narrative in 2014 is, despite Abu Dhabi’s oil, Dubai’s trade and the UAE’s overall financial wealth, first and foremost about real estate development, just as it was in 2008 and the years before. The market is short on diversification and its up and downside risks have been and still remain tied to property values.</p>
<p>In that sense, the extreme — and in hindsight misplaced — trust in Arabtec, the construction and development holding whose stock triggered the slide in Dubai and even affected other Gulf markets, is almost a necessary aspect of the equities hype that was produced by the resurgence of real estate sales in a narrow development sphere focused on Dubai and Abu Dhabi.</p>
<p>Arabtec was trumpeting its determination to expand to larger scopes and prove itself as a world-level contractor and developer with projects from St. Petersburg, where it signed as a contractor on Europe’s tallest building, to Cairo, where its development unit was signed to erect one million low income homes.</p>
<p>But the UAE was the base where Arabtec had radiated success in executing projects such as the Burj Khalifa, and the marketplace where it had shown off pricey new projects, announced as worth $3.8 billion, as recently as April. The UAE was also the space where Abu Dhabi’s state owned investment fund Aabar was a key stakeholder in Arabtec, while at the same time responsible for awarding Arabtec’s new properties unit with developing a major project in Abu Dhabi.</p>
<p>It took only a minor partial divestment by the state owned fund to trigger the selling frenzy that would reveal the fragility of valuation assumptions that regarded Arabtec as the autonomous producer of its success. All recent signs suggest that the Aabar shareholding — and not Arabtec’s competency — was perceived by the market as the guarantor that the firm could obtain business in local luxury projects where the state, personified by its rulers, is habitually credited as the maker of all big things.</p>
<p>In another sense, the case is hugely embarrassing for anyone who believes that the region’s stock markets are supervised in ways that protect small retail buyers. The governance systems, including supervisory agencies, banks, financial institutions, equities analysts, stock market reporters and regional business media, all failed to voice timely warnings.</p>
<p>Governance stakeholders should alert market participants to unusual developments such as important share trades in a listed company by any executive of that company. Not only did that not happen, but apparently neither did the system stop brokers from enticing clients to buy shares with borrowed money beyond the levels regulators had set as acceptable.</p>
<p>While the Dubai market and its brethren in Abu Dhabi and Qatar were blooming, analysts and those of us in the local and regional media were too busy cheering and did not pay enough attention to the risks — neglecting to share the knowledge of past regional experience that trades in equities are no recipe for risk-free redistribution of wealth.</p>
<p>Lessons of misplaced trust are a universal and recurrent feature of the securities markets experience. All indications are that this latest lesson is still ongoing and will linger for an indeterminable amount of time in the Gulf markets. As the DFM fell by more than 20 percent between May 6 and June 23, some news reports claimed the index had crossed into a bear market.</p>
<p>This description is contestable: by most definitions, a bear market entails a 20 percent downturn over at least two months. This notwithstanding, the developments of week 26 — including the continued panic selling of Arabtec stock and other selling allegedly forced by margin calls — lend themselves to taking a bearish perspective for weeks to come.</p>
<p>This would eventually shape into a full-fledged bear market — unless the counter-expectation of a market stabilization on basis of economic fundamentals bears out. When pondering strategic responses to either possibility, market participants may benefit from expanding their perspective to a broader consideration of emerging markets and markets in general.</p>
<p><strong>Global gains</strong></p>
<p>When compared with the first quarter in 2014, the overall performance of emerging markets in the second quarter was encouraging. Although advancing unevenly, the bourses of numerous emerging markets achieved gains in the year to date and specifically, some of the large markets that dipped in Q1 showed improved performances in Q2.</p>
<p>Mexico and South Africa both had stronger, single digit growth in the second quarter when compared with the first. Malaysia’s benchmark index in Kuala Lumpur advanced 1.7 percent in Q2 and closed the first half up 2.4 percent, year to date. The rising economic behemoth China, home to many of the most watched emerging market stocks, saw the Shanghai Composite Index rise 0.7 percent in the second quarter, putting the market at a year-to-date drop of 1.5 percent by June 30.</p>
<p>During the same period, performances recovered in two important equities markets, Brazil and Turkey. Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s Turkey recovered currency with markets after his AK Party won municipal elections on March 30. The BIST 100 index of the Borsa İstanbul gained 12.6 percent in the second quarter, departing from a morose first quarter that managed a net gain only it its last week of trading. In São Paulo, which had a lousy first quarter and lost about 13 percent until a turning point in mid March, the Bovespa Index advanced 5.5 percent in Q2.</p>
<p>Political hopes were instrumental in the advance of India’s SENSEX by 13.5 percent in Q2. This was more than double the first quarter’s percentage rate of growth, but the Indian market took off only after results of the country’s month-long parliamentary elections were clocked in early May. Contrary to some expectations, Moscow’s MICEX moved up despite the volatility related to the Ukraine crisis, adding 6.7 percent in Q2.</p>
<p>The country stories from all around the developing world are also reflected in this year’s performance of the MSCI Emerging Markets index, where a downtrend from 2013 carried over into January 2014. A recovery consumed the rest of the first quarter, and the index continued to improve from there. In the long term picture over the past four years, the emerging markets have been rather volatile and subdued in their growth when compared with developed markets.</p>
<p>At the same time, the recent performance of global financial markets and the global economy is no reason for complacency about the financial system, warned the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) in its Annual Report on June 29.</p>
<p>The Basel-based international financial institution that serves as bank to central banks and provides them with policy research <a href="http://www.bis.org/publ/arpdf/ar2014e.htm" target="_blank">said</a>, “The overall impression is that the global economy is healing but remains unbalanced. Growth has picked up, but long-term prospects are not that bright. Financial markets are euphoric, but progress in strengthening banks’ balance sheets has been uneven and private debt keeps growing. Macroeconomic policy has little room for [maneuvers] to deal with any untoward surprises that might be sprung, including a normal recession.”</p>
<p>In order to avoid an entrenchment of risk in the global economy and loss of maneuvering room on policy, BIS said it is necessary to dampen the extremes of the financial cycle via “improvements in policy frameworks — fiscal, monetary and prudential — to ensure a more symmetrical response across booms and busts.”</p>
<p>More robust short term response mechanisms and long term financial policy frameworks, at the potential expense of curbing those exciting short term booms, sound like innovations from which MENA economies and their securities exchanges could also benefit.</p>
<p>But, as the BIS report added, “Few are ready to curb financial booms that make everyone feel illusively richer.”</p>

According to the <a href="http://unctad.org/en/PublicationsLibrary/wir2014_en.pdf" target="_blank">2014 World Investment Report</a> released last week by UN trade and development body UNCTAD, $566 billion FDI went into developed economies, by which the organization means 30 of 34 OECD countries plus 11 non-OECD European countries, and Bermuda.</p>
<p>While $778 billion of FDI inflows targeted developing economies, $529 billion or 68 percent of that amount flowed into only ten countries. China, when viewing the mainland and Hong Kong together, swallowed $201 billion, or almost 14 percent of the global FDI total. Another $108 billion targeted ‘transition’ economies — those between developing and developed.</p>
<p>In terms of FDI originations, or outflows, the global total reached $1.41 trillion in 2013, with the lion’s share of 61 percent emanating from developed economies. Both FDI streams showed single-digit percentage gains when compared with 2012 but remained about 15 percent below 2011 figures.</p>
<p>All four original BRICs were among the top twenty countries for FDI inflows in the 2014 report, but India trails the other three. With inflows of $28 billion in 2013, India was separated by a substantial margin — $36 billion — from Brazil and by almost $100 billion from the People’s Republic of China (without Hong Kong). In terms of FDI outflows, only China and Russia were among the top 20.</p>
<p>The most needy and vulnerable economies on the other hand attracted $57 billion or 3.9 percent of global FDI. This group comprised well over 80 nations which are classified as either least developed (LDCs) or as landlocked developing or small island developing countries (with overlaps between the 49 LDCs and the two other groups).</p>
<p>Lebanon, for those who are concerned, is part of the developing countries bracket and not specifically addressed in the WIR beyond being identified as a country that was among five West Asian countries that drew in between one and five billion dollars in FDI in 2013 and among another set of five West Asian countries that produced less than $1 billion each in FDI outflows.  Other than that, the WIR dedicated exactly one sentence to the country of the cedars, saying, “FDI to Lebanon is estimated to have fallen by 23 percent, with most of the flows still focused on the real estate market, which registered a significant decrease in investments from the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries.”</p>
<p>The point most worth noting is perhaps that the estimated drop in Lebanese FDI inflows is not necessarily as incisive economically as its size suggests because the FDI targets were in real estate, not in industry or other productive sectors. And for Lebanon in particular, FDI — or its absence — in the current economic cycle may have fewer implications than for most other countries when compared to other forms of financial interactions such as remittances and foreign deposits in the banking sector.</p>
<p><strong>The bigger worries</strong></p>
<p>The question remains how the current state of global investments offers an “encouraging trend” in the view of the WIR’s authors, specifically one that meshes with the lead idea attached to the report, which relates to the private sector’s role in achieving global development goals.</p>
<p>In a sentence signed by UN Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon, “This year’s World Investment Report offers a global action plan for galvanizing the role of businesses in achieving future sustainable development goals, and enhancing the private sector’s positive economic, social and environmental impacts.”</p>
<p>As the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) are approaching the end of their shelf lives in 2015, the UN is reissuing these goals as Sustainable Development Goals, or SDGs. The WIR cites the SDGs as pertaining to “poverty reduction, food security, human health and education, climate change mitigation, and a range of other objectives across the economic, social and environmental pillars.” The timeframe for tackling these familiar objectives is the period from 2015 to 2030.</p>
<p>According to WIR estimates, implementation of SDGs in developing countries will require somewhere between $3.3 trillion and $4.5 trillion annually, a somewhat broad range in both absolute and percentage terms. The estimated need covers five vast areas: basic infrastructure, food security, health, education and climate change.</p>
<p>Although MDGs have been pushed since their adoption by the global community in 2000, the world faces a $2.5 trillion annual funding gap for implementing the relevant investments in developing economies under the SDG moniker, the WIR says. Private sector involvement will propel infrastructure and other investable areas with SDG relevancy in some emerging and developing markets. On the other hand, the countries where FDI inflows are lowest, investment returns uncertain and private sector risks are often incalculable — namely the LDCs and other highly vulnerable countries — dependency on foreign aid will remain overpowering.</p>
<p>Private sector investments could play a positive role in propelling SDGs toward fulfillment in the most vulnerable and needy countries, the WIR suggests: “A target for the promotion of private sector investment in SDGs in LDCs could be to double the current growth rate of such investment.” Even then, however, it estimates that public funding and foreign aid would have to treble by 2030 from current levels to achieve SDGs in LDCs.</p>
<p>The language of development reports is generally incapable of conveying the realities of the affected nations and their citizens — who are basically the world’s poorest 15 percent with annual per capita gross national incomes of less than $1,000 — when their existentially necessary developments entail funding needs for that exceed their economic capabilities on practically every front.</p>
<p>Given the spotty track record of the past 15 years, where advancements to MDGs were strong in some regards and disenchanting in other aspects, it bears to note that the WIR sees the importance of private sector investments for tackling the SDGs. The report in this respect seems not to fully trust in its own headline optimism, however, and says, “Without higher levels of private sector investment, the financing requirements associated with the prospective SDGs in LDCs may be unrealistic.”</p>
<p>That does sound like a huge understatement.</p>

But Lebanese design and technology company Green Studios is carving out a garden empire one building at a time thanks to a patented technology that allows vegetation to grow on walls and on rooftops under regional climate conditions. Since they founded the company in Lebanon in 2009, their concept has begun to take root in the Middle East and North Africa region, and they have plans to bring their gardens across the Atlantic.</p>
<div><p>in their system, plants can survive without water for up to three days in harsh environments such as deserts, and as much as a week in milder environments.</p>
</div>
<p><b>Into the foliage</b></p>
<p><span>In hot climates such as the Gulf, growing greenery is tough business. With the brutal heat necessitating an abundant supply of water in order for plants to survive, growing a garden is a rather unsustainable endeavor. “We wanted to develop something that is applicable to super-hot [climates],” says Jamil Corbani cofounder and CEO of Green Studios. Together with cofounders Zeina Kronfol, a landscape architect, agriculture engineer Oliver Wehbe and architect Marc Abihaila, they set out to find a way for plants to grow in the desert.</span></p>
<p><span>Green Studios uses hydroponics, a technique of growing plants without soil in a mineral nutrient solution, which creates a multi-layered skin allowing the flora to grow on rooftops and walls. Hydroponics reduces the quantity of water needed for plants to grow and Corbani boasts that in their system, plants can survive without water for up to three days in harsh environments such as deserts, and as much as a week in milder environments.</span></p>
<p><span>There is a smart component to their technology. Each layer of the skin is distinct in function, with the core layer acting as an irrigation network, explains Corbani. The skin reacts to the outside temperature and distributes water and nutrients as needed. “It contains sensors and nano-sensors that measure humidity, temperature, acidity, electro conductivity and stuff like that, that are vital to plants’ health,” he says. The sensors transmit data to an electrical board which directs pumps to go on and off, pumping water and nutrients into the sponge.</span></p>
<p><span>The green innovators got their first patent for the skin in Lebanon in 2011, and according to Corbani are in the process of receiving patents in the United States for the updated version of the skin and system, which they are registering as different parts, and which they believe will provide better protection internationally than their patent filed in Lebanon. Besides having filed these two patents in the US, the company has another three or four ready for filing, according to Corbani. He claims that they intend on applying for new patents in the States as they continue to innovate. </span></p>
<p><span>To support their push toward innovation, they are in the process of opening a new SAL company, which will focus on the technological side of the operations. To be named Global Dispatch, it will fall alongside the original Green Studios — which will continue to create new designs — under Green Studios Holding, which is to be the second new addition to the family. Corbani anticipates that Global Dispatch will play an important role for the company in the US in the future.</span></p>

<p><span><b>Rise of the plants</b></span></p>
<p><span>Since their beginnings five years ago, Green Studios have clambered from a startup to become a visible presence both in Lebanon and in the region. When Executive last profiled the company, they had just submitted a bid to design a green roof for the Banque du Liban’s Hamra headquarters, a project commissioned jointly by BDL and UNDP-CEDRO, the United Nations Development Programme’s Country Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Demonstration Project for the Recovery of Lebanon. At the time of winning the BDL pitch, Green Studios had between eight and 10 projects in Lebanon, now up to a current 30 projects, six of which are in the region.</span></p>
<p><span>The BDL project, completed in 2013, brought them serious credibility under the watchful eye of the UN. “You had the whole of the UN body evaluating you on all levels – technically, everything. So we got an excellent score from the UN.” Green Studios were also selected to become part of Endeavor’s network at the 52nd International Selection Panel in Indonesia last February.</span></p>
<p><span>Besides building their reputation with international organizations, the company achieved tangible successes both locally and in the region. In Lebanon, recent achievements include their nomination by Herzog & de Meuron, a Pritzker Prize winning Swiss architectural firm, to install a green wall for Beirut Terraces. They have also been granted a project to build a green wall for residential project Raouche 1090 which Corbani claims will be the biggest outdoor green wall in the Arab world. Regionally, they have executed four projects in Cairo since 2013, amongst them a project with Egyptian holding company Raya Corporation, which is listed on the Egyptian stock market. They are currently pitching for dozens of projects around the region, but since these deals have not been closed, Corbani could not go into the details.</span></p>
<p><span>Green Studios’ revenues had grown to almost $700,000 by the end of their 2012-2013 fiscal year (ending in August) according to Corbani. This was up by 49 percent from the revenues they made at the end of their second year, of $471,000 in 2011.</span></p>
<p><span>The current shareholders are the four cofounders and two other team members. The ownership is scattered: cofounders Corbani, Abihaila, Wehbe and Kronfol at 48, 20, 10 and 10 percent respectively, with Karim Corbani at 9 percent and Rawan Zarour at 9 percent. They are looking for a round of angel funding for their expansion in the Arab world to the tune of $1.5 million, according to Corbani, which will dilute the shareholder base.</span></p>
<p><span><b>Futuristic vision</b></span></p>
<p><span>Corbani was perhaps most excited when he spoke about the company’s planned expansion into the US. To inaugurate their shy expansion into the US market, they will be exhibiting at the American Society of Landscape Architects’ annual meeting and expo in Denver, Colorado, in November. “We are going to look at other players, what are they doing, get a feel of the market, and exhibit as well, who we are, what do we do, what is our philosophy, what is our product, and our patent.” According to Corbani, they plan on leveraging their growth in the Arab world to inject more capital into their business in the US.</span></p>
<p><span>Though he acknowledges that Green Studios has a few competitors in North America, Corbani is confident that there will be space for the company. “The market is still virgin, there is room for more players to come.” Moreover, the CEO seems convinced of the inherent worth of Green Studios’ technology. “What we have in hand is something completely … it’s the future. By all means, it’s the future.”</span></p>

The size of the screen, arrangement and comfort levels of the seating, the venue’s promotions and general ambiance are all crucial criteria.</p>
<p><span>To take some of the weight off, Executive has done the groundwork and compiled a list of venues where World Cup viewing promises to be a rewarding experience.</span></p>
<p><strong>Pop-up venues</strong></p>
<p><span>For those who want the game and no distractions, the World Cup parks are ideal.</span></p>
<p>Beirut Fan Village at Beirut Waterfront boasts a VIP section with a capacity of 200 and its own high resolution LED screen (entrance $20), a regular bleacher style section which fits 400 people (entrance $7) and has two high definition LED screens and a food court section with outlets like Snack Faysal and Pinkberry ice cream, with Check Point Charlie manning the bar. The food court also has a pizza place, a sushi restaurant and its own screen where one can enjoy the match while dining. Mascots, giveaways, daily promotions and occasional fireworks all ensure a festive experience.</p>
<p>Dbayeh’s Sport Zone is organizing “3ish Mondial” (live the world cup), a fan park featuring five large screens, halftime entertainment, bets and daily predictions for the risk takers.</p>
<p><span>For those who don’t want to sacrifice their rooftop bar evening, Downtown’s Capitole is projecting the game on big screens viewable from just about anywhere in the bar and is fostering a healthy competitive spirit by identifying each table’s chosen team with a national flag. Flags of the night’s competing teams will be on display as well.</span></p>
<p><span>For those who do not venture out of Hamra, Garcia’s is playing the World Cup with all its live commentary glory in their outdoor seating areas. Those sitting inside can still watch the games while listening to the DJ’s music.</span></p>
<p><span>Clé Restaurant and Bar is going all out for the month, airing the games on a 200-inch screen in their garden while those sitting indoors can watch the games on the five screens spread indoors. Clé promises “nice surprises at halftime,” and a fun mood created by different promotional items and theme nights depending on the competing teams.</span></p>
<p>For those who are looking for a good deal on their alcohol for the game, the Hilton hotel’s Pool Bar has open beer and a plate of nachos for $29, while Nu Cocktail Bar in Uruguay Street offers its menu items for half the price during the 7 p.m. matches. Casper & Gambini’s also has a set menu including classic sports food fare such as nachos and chicken wings.</p>

<p><strong>Loyalty to a team first</strong></p>
<p><span>Some may want to extend team loyalty to their choice of venue. Uruguay Street’s Check Point Charlie with its German motif décor is a natural choice for supporters of the German national team while La Piazza restaurant in Sodeco proudly displays a huge Italian flag on its entrance. Uruguay Cocktail Bar goes the extra mile and offers free shots whenever the Uruguayan team scores a goal. </span></p>
<p><span>And finally for those who are looking to escape all the World Cup hype, and yet still want to enjoy a quick drink or a cup of coffee, Le Gray Hotel is not airing the games so a drink in their rooftop bar Cherry on Top could be the solution. Penelope cafe in Badaro is another safe haven for coffee drinkers.</span></p>

Every night since the onset of the games, crowds gather around TV screens, at home or in commercial venues, and loud cheers mixed in with the occasional firework are a common celebratory occurrence.</p>
<p>World Cup fever strikes the country at full force every time, and commercial venues once again find themselves in the familiar position of first trying to lure viewers away from the more cost-effective home gatherings, now that the games are being aired for free, and to attract them into their venue as opposed to competitors.</p>
<p><b>Success of pop-up venues</b></p>
<p><span>Keeping in mind that the broadcasting rights’ contract for commercial venues is different than the home viewing deals and comes with a much heftier price tag — starting at $3,000 and going up to $20,000 according to Mohamad Al Khatib from MK Electronics which supplied most commercial venues in Beirut with the beIN satellite receiver — one has to wonder if this investment is a wise one, and if hospitality venues will get a good return for their buck.</span></p>
<p>One type of commercial venture that is successful in capitalizing on the football hype is that of the pop-up venue constructed especially for World Cup viewing, such as Beirut Fan Park (BFP) in Beirut Waterfront or the Hyundai Football Village in Zaitunay Bay. Such ventures typically recreate the feeling of watching the games live through stadium style bleacher seating, huge LED screens and half-time entertainment such as mascots or cheerleaders. Loud and fiery, they are favored by diehard fans or by those looking for a change from restaurant viewing.</p>
<p>Entry fees start off at $7, depending on the park, and can reach up to $20 toward the final games. Organizers rely on sponsors to cover most of their investment; Hadi Hibri, one of the partners in VII Management which is organizing BFP, says they invested over $300,000 into the park including the broadcasting rights — but that sum was mainly covered by their 30 sponsors, and the park itself was “supported by Solidere.” Hibri explains that they also rented out the spaces in their food court to a variety of eateries at a fixed price, thereby increasing their profit margin as well. Solicet, the team behind Zaitunay Bay’s park, also lists around a dozen sponsors and supporters who covered most of their event’s fees.</p>
<p><span>World Cup parks also aim to increase pedestrian traffic in the surrounding area. Amal Khoury, communication manager at Zaitunay Bay, says they offered the venue to Solicit because “we were interested in the footfall to encourage the restaurants’ business and to allow those who don’t want to be in a restaurant to view the games in the public areas of Zaitunay Bay.”</span></p>
<p></p><div><div><a href="http://www.executive-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Cle.jpg"><img src="http://www.executive-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Cle.jpg" alt="World Cup at Clé, Hamra" width="580" height="386"></a><span><a href="http://www.executive-magazine.com/author/greg-demarque">Greg Demarque</a> | Executive</span></div><p>World Cup at Clé, Hamra</p></div>
<p><b>Nil-nil for some restaurants and bars</b></p>
<p><span>Meanwhile, restaurants and bars have mixed feelings regarding the season’s impact on their venues, acknowledging the increased footfall but saying that it’s generally not matched with a significant increase in revenue. </span></p>
<p><span>Charlie Freim, owner of Garcia’s in Hamra and Central Station in Mar Mkhayel, sees screening the World Cup as an added value service he provides his customers which doesn’t make extra profit during the World Cup season; in fact he makes around 30 to 35 percent less than the usual average when the place is full. “People generally tend to consume less during the games and focus more on beers and appetizers rather than cocktails or meals. Also, many times it is just men alone who come to watch the game so they spend less than when they come with a group that has women,” explains Freim. </span></p>
<p><span>Turnover is also lower during the games. For Toni Rizk, CEO of Tri Concepts which runs several pubs on Downtown’s Uruguay Street, many customers spend over three hours in the venue over just a couple of beers.</span></p>
<p>Faced with this situation, many bars and restaurants are offering set menus of drinks and appetizers, or discounts and promotional items, in an effort to both build hype around their venues as the place to be during the World Cup and ensure at least a minimum order, which would go toward covering their cost.</p>
<p>Other venues cover part of their World Cup investment through sponsors; Creditbank sponsored the broadcasting rights fees for Casper & Gambini’s for example. None of the venues Executive spoke to opted for minimum charge strategy as that would drive viewers away.</p>
<p>However, all restaurants and bars Executive spoke to said that it would not be viable for them not to air the games while their competitors are doing so right next to them as that gives others an edge over them. “We show the World Cup because not doing so means that our customers would choose to go elsewhere during that period,” says Rita Saati, marketing officer at Roadster’s.</p>
<p><b>The world’s carnival</b></p>
<p><span>Ussama Makarem, CEO of Clé Bar in Hamra, feels that broadcasting the World Cup would not make mathematical sense for smaller venues as people generally choose to watch the games in larger venues and so their returns won’t add up. However, for Clé, which has a seating capacity of 120, Makarem says he would be losing profits and clientele if he didn’t air the games. </span></p>
<p><span>Despite the claims of flat profit margins, many venues report that footfall does increase during World Cup month, especially during weekdays when people are normally more inclined to stay at home rather than go out. </span></p>
<p><span>Speaking for The Peninsula in Dbayeh, Maryse Tebcharany says they have been fully booked since the opening match and have had to “reject tens of reservations each night to maintain quality.” </span></p>
<p>Capitole Rooftop Bar in the downtown area has noticed an increase in both the numbers of reservations and in the number within the reserving groups. “Before the World Cup, we used to get reservations for groups of maximum six or seven. Now we get reservations for groups of around ten to fourteen in our dinner section because people like to watch the World Cup in big groups while having a bite,” said Capitole’s marketing manager.</p>
<p><span>As the World Cup carnival rolls along, it seems that the hospitality venues should avoid focusing on the profit lines and just enjoy the games. “This is one of the biggest events on Earth: you have the most people who watch it all over the world and it happens once every four years, spread over 31 days. I personally enjoy festivals and think it’s also nice to have a good time,” says Makarem.</span></p>

<p><span>Two of these came via loans worth €45 million ($61.3 million) apiece to Byblos Bank and Fransabank. The other two were equity investments, one of €11 million ($15 million) in First National Bank and the other €20 million ($27.2 million) in regional private equity fund EuroMena III. </span></p>
<p><span>“It seemed important to us in this difficult period to show that the Lebanese financial sector and the Lebanese economy represent a good investment opportunity,” says Philippe de Fontaine Vive, the vice president of the EIB.</span></p>
<p><span>The loans to the local banks are to be channeled into the economy at a multiplier effect of two to support lending to SMEs, according to de Fontaine Vive. “We request the bank to lend double of what we are lending to the bank. So it’s a legal commitment of at least two, but nothing prevents these banks from being even more efficient,” he says. The SMEs to be invested in would be held to certain good governance principles, overseen by the EIB, according to de Fontaine Vive.</span></p>
<p><span>With a 12-year maturity granted to the commercial banks, they are also expected on their side to lend for periods up to 12 years, according to the vice president — maturities he claims are hard to find on today’s market. As far as interest rates go, de Fontaine Vive says these have not yet been set and will partly depend on the terms set between the banks and the SMEs.</span></p>
<p><strong>EIB’s relationship with Lebanon</strong></p>
<p><span>The financing falls under a long-standing EIB policy of promoting the EU’s policy objectives overseas under its Facility for Euro-Mediterranean Investment and Partnership (FEMIP). According to the <a href="http://www.eib.europa.eu/attachments/country/lebanon_2014_en.pdf" target="_blank">EIB’s website</a>, these objectives are encouraging the modernization and liberalization of economies of the EU’s partner countries in the Mediterranean.</span></p>
<p><span>FEMIP’s financing to Lebanon reached €740 million ($1 billion) between 2002 (the date of its establishment) and 2012, according to a <a href="http://www.byblosbank.com/Library/Files/Lebanon/Publications/Economic%20Research/Lebanon%20This%20Week/Lebanon%20This%20Week_327.pdf" target="_blank">2013 Byblos Bank report</a>. This is equivalent to 5.2 percent of its investments in the Mediterranean region, which totaled €14.2 billion ($19.3 billion) in the same period, in Morocco, Egypt, Tunisia, Syria, Israel, Lebanon, Algeria, Jordan and the West Bank and Gaza, the report said.</span></p>
<p><span>Some of the agreements signed most recently represent just another facet of these institutions’ long relationship with the EIB. Byblos Bank received two prior loans from the EIB — $60 million in 2005 and $87 million in 2007, according to a Byblos Bank press release.</span></p>
<p><span>Similarly, this is the third equity investment the EIB makes in an equity fund managed by the Capital Trust Group. The €20 million ($27 million) investment in EuroMena III was preceded by $17 million in EuroMena II and $12 million in the first EuroMena fund.</span></p>
<p><span>Rare, however, is the FNB investment, which according to de Fontaine Vive is the EIB’s first significant equity stake in the capital of a Lebanese bank. Like the other financial institution, FNB intends to establish a long-lasting relationship. “In this transaction what we value more is the strategic partnership,” says Rami El Nimer, chair and general manager of FNB. The EIB’s financing will play into FNB’s capital increase of $40 million, $25 million of which will be coming from existing shareholders, according to Nimer.</span></p>
<p><strong>The perks of international money</strong></p>
<p>Funding from foreign financial institutions certainly has its perks. In EuroMena’s case, their relationship with the EIB and the reputation they’ve gained from it has facilitated subsequent investment. With their third EuroMena fund raising $100 million so far, the $27.2 million EIB investment was the largest investment among a pool of international financial institutions, which invested a combined total of $56 million in EuroMena III. Other investors in this pool included the DEG (Deutsche Investitions- und Entwicklungsgesellschaft), the International Finance Corporation and Électricité de France.</p>
<p><span>“The EIB, DEG and IFC are as important because they are development financial institutions that do a very thorough due diligence before they invest in a fund. They impose on a fund very tough, thorough controls because it’s public money. And they don’t mess with public money,” says Romen Mathieu, managing director of the EuroMena fund at the Capital Trust Group.</span></p>
<p><span>Having already raised $100 million for their third fund, Mathieu was confident that having such investors under their belt would facilitate meeting their closing target between $150 million and $200 million: “When you have such investors with you, other investors come along.”</span></p>

The company, presumably driven by a mixture of its own daring ambitions and the resurgent construction business in the United Arab Emirates and other Gulf countries, had seen its share price double in roughly two months between mid-January and mid-April. The share opened above AED 5 ($1.36) on April 20 and rallied another 47 percent to AED 7.40 on May 14, its highest close ever.</p>
<p>Amid a wave of surprising news, however, the Arabtec share price fell just as precipitously in the five weeks since and closed last week at AED 4.26 — levels last seen in early April. What makes this slide stand out was that the company started to dominate the trading activity on the DFM with high volumes of share sales around June 8, ahead of a series of surprising disclosures. On June 11, the company posted a press release among its official company disclosures on the DFM, in which chief executive Hasan Ismaik dismissed “rumors” about the company’s share price in the two preceding days as well as rumors about its future plans, without refuting any allegation or even specifying what either rumor might be.</p>
<p>On June 12, the company added another disclosure — posted only in Arabic — denying that it planned any new listing of a unit on the DFM and on June 15, it announced a board meeting for June 18 to discuss projects and “other business.” In the meanwhile, the selloff of Arabtec shares continued as the market was treated to news that Ismaik had expanded his personally held stake from 8 percent earlier in the year to 21.5 percent by late May and then to almost 29 percent by June 15.</p>
<p>At the same time, the largest institutional investor in Arabtec, a unit of Abu Dhabi state owned International Petroleum Investment Company (IPIC) that goes by the name of Aabar Investments, caused nervousness among investors by reducing its stake in Arabtec to around 19 percent from 21.6 percent in share sales between June 8 and 10. Subsequent news that Aabar had divested of another 4.6 percent were based on information on the DFM website that the market operator described on June 15 as “temporary system glitch” in the last trading hour.</p>
<p>All this was topped on June 19, however, when Arabtec announced the results of its June 18 board meeting, revealing that the “other business” discussed by the board constituted the resignation of the company’s CEO and since quite recently, largest shareholder, Ismaik. The stock predictably tanked again when this bombshell hit. By time of this writing on June 23, Bloomberg and Reuters news services cited “sources” saying that a key executive and an unspecified number of employees had been dismissed.</p>
<p>However, there was no DFM market statement by Arabtec to this extent and the corporate website only reflected the revision of board membership announced in the June 19 DFM disclosure. The website also did not any provide information on the Arabtec viewpoint of the developments since the beginning of June. However, those looking for insights into the company’s business approach could gain incisive flashes of enlightenment on what Arabtec (or its public relations writers) called “our commitment.”</p>
<p>“Arabtec Holding is a Publicly Listed Company and therefore we must be publicly open and transparent,” the page explained. The company claims to be bursting with integrity and ethical behavior via a code of conduct for executive on all levels. It also affirms that disclosure of “all material matters concerning the company’s activities should be timely and balanced”. However, the most recent minutes of a board meeting that can be accessed on the site date from August 7, 2012 and the most recent disclosure shown is dated July 7, 2013.</p>
<p><strong>Markets down</strong></p>
<p>Led by Arabtec’s continued slide — and with the holy month of Ramadan fast approaching — index readings and trading activities across Arab securities markets retreated in the year’s 25th week. Meanwhile, the top indices in the United States were shooting up to new records as the Federal Reserve was reassuring investors about the strength of and outlook for the American economy.</p>
<p>The region’s major markets fell noticeably in what was plainly one of the year’s most underperforming weeks for Arab equities. Benchmark indices for the Qatari, Kuwaiti, Egyptian and Dubai bourses dropped between 4 and 5 percent. Markets in Amman, Casablanca, Manama, Riyadh and Abu Dhabi lost between 1 and 3 percent. Muscat and Beirut could hardly be called gainers as each advanced by less than a tenth of a percent.

Now in its third year, BDW has made a name for itself in showcasing and engaging the local creative community. The week featured around 87 exhibitions by local designers along with a variety of talks by international and local speakers, as well as workshops on topics ranging from design and business to jewelry and fashion. Networking happy hours, dinners, design-related film screenings and open markets also took place throughout the week.</p>
<p>All these activities provided a platform for both established and emerging Lebanese designers, giving the public the opportunity to learn more about them and appreciate their work as a viable part of the economy — albeit in need of some support. Designers in turn were able to engage with each other, strengthening the network of local artisans.</p>

<p>One of the highlights of BDW was the Newcomers Exhibition — a showcase that exemplifies how BDW has become a springpad for local talent. Last year, Jo Baaklini participated in the Newcomers Exhibition and went on to be part of fashion design incubator Starch’s 2013 lineup of designers. He got then his own catwalk experience during this year’s Fashion Forward event in Dubai. This year, Baaklini returned to BDW with Starch.</p>
<p>Another goal of BDW was the collaboration and sharing of ideas that naturally occur when the design community gets together. “The most beautiful part of Beirut Design Week is the idea of collaboration: meeting new people and knowing more about other designers,” said Emne Mroue, who took part in the Newcomers Exhibition with her Sacoche collection.</p>
<p>Finally, BDW aimed to engage and train designers with talks and workshops throughout the week. This expanded emphasis was a welcome change from 2013’s BDW, which had only one day dedicated to such events.</p>
<p>BDW was organized by the MENA Design and Research Center, a nonprofit organization cofounded by Doreen Toutikian, an interdisciplinary designer and entrepreneur, and Maya Karanouh, CEO of TAGbrands, a branding consultancy.</p>

When Al-Mawarid Bank and local startup Presella jointly announced the bank’s equity participation in the company yesterday, it had been almost a year since Banque du Liban (BDL) created the funding mechanism that would support this type of deal. Mawarid’s investment in Presella was the first to be approved by the central bank under this system, whereby the company will be receiving $200,000 from the bank for an equity stake of just under 21 percent. This suggests the shareholders value the company at around $1 million.</p>
<p>The key element behind the deal is <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.executive-magazine.com%2Fbusiness-finance%2Fbusiness%2Fin-need-of-nurture&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNG6Kyyogca13hc2OqGDuuJTXCxhBA" target="_blank">Circular 331</a>, which was passed by the central bank in August of last year. Under this circular, the central bank subsidizes 75 percent of an equity investment by commercial banks into a startup company under an arrangement that allows commercial banks to buy treasury bills and sell them back to the central bank at a discounted rate.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fpresella.com%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNGkH_YB0fkJqBL6NambeiQoKx_xTQ" target="_blank">Presella</a> is an online ticketing platform that seeks to help event organizers reduce the financial risk of throwing events. The company offers normal services such as selling tickets, but also has a crowdfunding option whereby anyone organizing an event can set the minimum number of tickets that need to be sold for the event to take place. In about one and a half years, the startup has sold over $650,000 worth of tickets between hundreds of small and medium sized events, primarily in Beirut, followed by rollouts in Dubai and events in Cyprus and Turkey.</p>
<p><strong>Start from the bottom</strong></p>
<p>The company has certainly grown since its 2012 debut. Presella was one of the eight startups that graduated from <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.executive-magazine.com%2Fbusiness-finance%2Fbusiness%2Fmoney-for-ideas&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNHEBqT_Q-NKTV_zQrhWjgUlhflUbg" target="_blank">former acceleration program Seeqnce</a>, which provided its first round of funding of $76,500, split between cash and in-kind services such as office space and an internet connection.</p>
<p>It was through a pitching session held by Seeqnce in 2013 that Presella first caught the eye of <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.executive-magazine.com%2Fbusiness-finance%2Fbusiness%2Fmarwan-kheireddine-investing-in-local-startups&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNGSuRQ0CzbMZZg5fOwGDUYX10fNCQ" target="_blank">Marwan Kheireddine</a>, chair and general manager of Mawarid, major shareholder in Virgin Megastore in Lebanon and Saudi Arabia, and a former minister in the 2011–2014 government of Najib Mikati. Kheireddine had been invited to the pitching event as an angel investor. Earmarking them for investment, Kheireddine pushed forward when Circular 331 was promulgated.</p>
<p>Mawarid’s investment is part of Presella’s $300,000 second round of funding. In addition to the bank’s $200,000, the startup will receive $100,000 from a handful of Lebanese angel investors. The company plans on using the money to expand in the Emirati, Qatari and Saudi markets. “We are aiming to be a success story, to inspire entrepreneurs in Lebanon,” says cofounder Walid Singer.</p>
<p>The current shareholders include cofounders Singer and Louay Kadri, as well as a group shareholding that originated in the Seeqnce accelerator program. After the second funding round, Presella’s shareholders will include six new members, says Singer.</p>
<p>And Mawarid is letting them drive. The bank will take a board seat, but they will not engage with them as advisors, according to Kheireddine. “Being a bank on their board gives them credibility wherever they go, so we can open doors for them,” he says. “It is a relatively well structured board. Had we gone into another investment that was really brand new, right off the drawing board, the chances are we would position ourselves to play a bigger role in that company.”</p>
<p>According to Kheireddine, Mawarid is planning on exiting the company in five years, although the circular gives them up to seven years.</p>
<p><strong>Blazing the trail</strong></p>
<p>When Circular 331 was passed, it generated a lot of hype over the maximum of approximately $400 million that could be injected into the startup economy. But while the rate of investment has not been promising thus far, such deals may see an uptick now that the first bank has taken the plunge.</p>
<p>The central bank is currently looking through the documents of a total of five startups, but is aware of approximately 25–30 more in the process of applying, according to Marianne Hoayek, head of the Executive Office at BDL.</p>
<p>A handful of banks are actively looking for deals to invest in. For his part, Kheireddine plans to have Mawarid invest in at least 30 companies. The bank is in the process of looking at three other investments, one of which it has already applied to the central bank for, according to Kheireddine.</p>
<p>As far as diversification goes, Mawarid can invest up to $3 million into startup companies, according to the terms of the circular which limit the amount of investment a bank can make into startup companies to 3 percent of a bank’s tier 1 capital. In Mawarid’s case, this capital stands at around $100 million, according to the chair. It is also limited to investments of $300,000 or less, since the circular defines that a bank can only invest a tenth of the 3 percent into any one company.</p>
<p>While it is difficult to project how many startups will see investment over the next couple of years, Kheireddine was adamant that conservative banks in Lebanon need to change their culture in terms of how they perceive startups and begin to understand how to invest in them (see <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.executive-magazine.com%2Fbusiness-finance%2Fbusiness%2Fmarwan-kheireddine-investing-in-local-startups&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNGSuRQ0CzbMZZg5fOwGDUYX10fNCQ" target="_blank">Q&A with Marwan Kheireddine</a>).</p>
<p>Mawarid’s investment certainly creates a stronger potential for other banks to follow suit, now that a precedent is set. “We knew that Circular 331 had to be ironed out,” says Kheireddine. “There were a lot of things that needed clarification internally within the central bank and within each bank. So we went through that first investment with the intention of paving the way for other investments to come.”</p>
<p>To apply for central bank funding, the startup and the commercial bank have to sign a term sheet, which is sent to the central bank along with other documentation such as the business plan. The central bank makes sure that the company is compliant with Circular 331, and then advances 75 percent of the funds through the treasury bill mechanism while the bank comes up with the other 25 percent.</p>
<p>If the investment is profitable, the commercial bank has to split gains from dividends or the sale of the shares 50–50 with the central bank.</p>
<p>“Success will come; the question is whether it’s going to be huge or small,” says Kheireddine. “I think that we will end up investing in at least a few hundred companies, utilizing a few million dollars of the $400 million, and making some money on some of the companies. But that’s the least that I would like to see.”</p>

He was involved in pushing <a href="http://www.bdl.gov.lb/circulars/intermediary/5/37/0/Intermediate-Circulars.html" target="_blank">Circular 331</a> in coordination with former Minister of Telecommunications Nicolas Sehnaoui. Executive sat with him to talk about Mawarid’s recent investment in local startup Presella.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>So are you Presella’s number one fan?</strong></p>
<p>Does it really matter? I don’t think so. What is important is that they get to work, and prove that their business plan is achievable, and that they can create jobs and make returns.</p>
<p> </p>
<div><p>I think that at most we will be financing semi-crazy ideas.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>You actually have some entrepreneurial and investment experience. Are you nervous that other banks who are directly investing into startups don’t have this kind of knowledge?</strong></p>
<p>No, I think that the challenge banks will have, which we will also have as a bank, is changing their mentality from lenders to investors. Because the two things are totally different. When you lend someone money, you’re lending them with the intention and you’re taking all the required precautions to ensure that they will pay you back the principal amount that they borrowed plus all interest and charges and what have you. Now if you are investing, you’re taking a totally different approach, you’re looking at the business model, you’re looking at the management capabilities, you’re looking at the opportunity of success. But then you may lose money. And bankers are not designed — their DNA does not really work well with losing money. So there is a culture shift that needs to take place in banks in order to move them from great lenders and knowing exactly how to lend, to great investors and thinking how to invest.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>But even with a culture shift, isn’t this a very risky venture for banks who have no past experience in investing, and who are notoriously conservative?</strong></p>
<p>I honestly think that not all banks are going to take this opportunity. It was very wise by the central bank to force banks to provide 25 percent [of any investment]. Because had this not been there, the market would have probably seen a lot of lousy investments. But the fact that banks have to put up 25 percent of any investment from their own money, means basically that there is not going to be an investment that is not well analyzed and not well looked at. So that will protect the system, basically.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Do you thinks banks will look into these ventures as genuine profit making opportunities or do you think it’s going to start more as a corporate social responsibility (CSR) policy by banks who want to show that they’re dynamic players in the ecosystem?</strong></p>
<p>I think a few banks will use that as a CSR initiative. And you know what? That’s fine. Big deal. At the end of the day, they are taking a risk in investing in companies. They are going to lose 25 percent of their investment if they choose badly, and if they don’t do enough investments as a policy, the chances of them losing all their investment is huge.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Isn’t it also risky for the central bank?</strong></p>
<p>When the central bank [decided] this, we assumed 1 out of 10, or 1 out of 15 [startups] would make it.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Aren’t these figures a global rule of thumb? How do we know if it will apply to Lebanon?</strong></p>
<p>We don’t know. But I think we will perform slightly better than the average international performance, mostly because the investment decision will be taken by banks that are conservative in nature. So in my mind, we’re not going to be financing crazy ideas. I think that at most we will be financing semi-crazy ideas.</p>
<p>But if you end up investing in a few thousand companies, by sheer application of the statistics, the central bank should be benefiting. I think Armageddon for all of us is if we only invest in a few companies, and then don’t find anything else. Then the chances are we are losing all of our investments — but then it’s not the 400 million, it’s a very small amount. So statistically speaking, the probability of success should be higher than what we have seen internationally, only because banks are more conservative in their decisionmaking. Irrespective of how entrepreneurial you are going to push them to be, they will still be conservative.</p>

<p>Answers to this question circulated across social circles and media platforms, compounded by speculation on whether the national television station Tele Liban will be airing the games or not, to such an extent that many hospitality venue owners and everyday people are waiting until the last possible minute to commit to a subscription model while many home viewers are still confused as to how they can watch the World Cup.</p>
<p>The short and simple answer is that the World Cup can be watched through beIN Sports, previously known as Al Jazeera Sports, which purchased the distribution and exclusive broadcasting rights from world football body FIFA for the MENA region in 2009.</p>
<p>The channel also bought the rights to broadcast other sporting events such as Formula 1 races, European football championships and US basketball games, to only cite a few, making it a one-stop provider for sports fans.</p>
<p><strong>Fighting pirated feeds</strong></p>
<p>Such a bouquet of sporting events does not come cheap — beIN <a href="http://www.thenational.ae/business/media/al-jazeera-wins-middle-east-tv-rights-to-world-cups" target="_blank">reportedly spent $1 billion</a> for a package of sports content rights, including the 2010 and 2014 World Cups, an investment that it wants to ensure pays off. In Lebanon, this could prove especially challenging given the high rate of unlicensed cable feeds. For months now, the company has been attempting to catalog legitimate users, asking them to register their smart card’s ID number and receiver number on the beIN website, thereby linking them together and identifying their owner. Registration is only allowed for particular receivers and card models; if the receiver is not on the approved list — and only two models are — then the subscriber must purchase another beIN-secured receiver. Otherwise, the beIN feed is cut off.</p>
<p>This move is one that the company has been implementing to control pirated viewing. Since June 1, 2014, all receivers and smart cards that are not registered have their access to beIN channels blocked. This has made the flood of unlicensed and unencrypted receivers unusable to directly watch the brand’s channels. Also, since each receiver is linked to one smart card, the chances for splitting the cable have been lowered. To sweeten the deal for paying subscribers, beIN made PC and mobile viewing possible through the brand’s website by providing one’s unique smart card number.</p>
<p>The efforts seem to be bearing results: even some neighborhood cable distributors — who usually find ways around such technological measures — say the only way to watch the games this year is through a secured receiver.</p>
<p><strong>Then, how to watch the games?</strong></p>
<p>In Lebanon, one can so far get beIN Sports through two main dealers, according to the brand’s website: MK Electronics-Echosat, which has the distribution rights for both home and commercial viewing by satellite through beIN receivers, and Sama, which has the same rights in addition to rebroadcasting by land and by Internet Protocol Television.</p>
<p>Both main dealers refuse to disclose the exact amount they paid beIN for rights, but Hassan Zein, the Executive Director of Sama, says it is in the hundreds of thousands of dollars. The two dealers say beIN invested into and shared with them the technology to block or detect pirated viewing. They also claimed that they would take legal action against anyone who shows the games by unlicensed means.</p>
<p>So what of the numerous other providers? Mohamad Al Khatib, CEO of MK Group, explains that the remaining 36 dealers listed on <a href="http://www.en.beinsports.net/dealers" target="_blank">beIN’s website</a> for Lebanon are subdealers for either Sama or MK Electronics, selling the pair’s satellite receivers and smart cards in exchange for a percentage of the profits. “It is good for us because it allows us to be close to and cover all areas of Lebanon since some clients might not want to come all the way to our offices in Beirut just to [be able to watch the] World Cup,” says Khatib.</p>
<p>MK Electronics offers World Cup home viewing through beIN secure direct satellite receivers which they broadcast across three satellites: Qatari Es’hailSat, Egyptian Nilesat and Saudi Arabsat. This costs $46 for the receiver and $130 for a three month subscription.</p>
<p>Sama broadcasts the World Cup for home viewing through cable to a beIN receiver, which Zein says they’re asking subdealers to loan, free of charge, to their trusted clients during the World Cup month, and a smart card that costs $110 per month.</p>
<p>So it is left up to the viewer to decide if they want to choose MK Electronics and pay around $50 dollars extra for a longer viewing period — which would then include replays and summaries as well as whatever else is going on in the world of sports until their three month subscriptions ends in August — or opt for the one month option of Sama which will stop directly at the end of the World Cup.</p>
<p>While these prices may seem reasonable to some, many Lebanese simply cannot afford to pay extra fees to enjoy the football matches — not to mention additional fees piled on by some subdealers. This is why Tele Liban is attempting to secure last minute broadcasting rights from beIN so it may then air the games for free on its channel. As this article went to publication, the outcome was still uncertain, though hopes for a last minute surprise were still alive with the Qatari Prime Minister promising Lebanon’s Interior Minister he will help secure the rights for TL.</p>
<p><strong>A different deal for venues</strong></p>
<p>Even if TL does manage to show the games for free, hospitality venues such as cafés and bars are bound by an annual commercial viewing contract and cannot broadcast from TL or from cable. Khatib, who has the rights to sell commercial viewing, explains that the criteria for pricing differs for each venue and is based on guidelines set by beIN, which has the final decision in setting the price. The contract is signed directly with beIN — which gets the majority of the profits.</p>
<p>The criteria used to price commercial viewing are: venue category, determined by the number of stars of hotels or the quality and pricing of restaurants; venue location — whether it’s in a high traffic area or not; the venue’s seating capacity; and whether it is part of a restaurant chain or not. Annual subscriptions for commercial viewing cost from $3,000 to $20,000 per year, according to Khatib.</p>
<p>For Lebanese unwilling to shell out the cash to watch the games at home, hopes will be pinned on local venues showing the matches to crowds of football loving customers. And after all, isn’t the World Cup about bring people together?</p>

<p>In reality, all this is merely a Lebanese way of preparing for the World Cup and showing support for people’s favorite teams. The fact that the national team has never qualified for the World Cup does not appear to have affected people’s enthusiasm for the event, instead bolstering their loyalty to other popular teams. This loyalty is widely demonstrated during each international event through the display of some country’s flag, and the bigger the better.</p>
<p><strong>Nationalism and internationalism</strong></p>
<p>So where do these flags come from? Lebanese wholesalers of Chinese manufactured seasonal novelty games and gift items begin ordering flags directly from China at least four months in advance to ensure timely delivery, according to Hanna Daouk of Khalil Ismail Establishment, a Lebanese wholesaler that was commonly cited among the shop owners Executive spoke to.</p>
<p>Many of the smaller traders buy their flags from such wholesalers and resell them at a higher price to make a profit. Aside from Khalil Ismail Establishment, Safawi Establishment and Hannoun were other frequently mentioned names. “We order around two large crates of flags, so we have approximately a hundred flags for each country we order, aside from the various gadgets, and we manage to sell all our stock to various shop owners in Lebanon,” says Daouk.</p>
<p>Wholesalers and smaller vendors alike are careful to invest mainly in the most popular countries in Lebanon or the ones with the strongest teams, lest they be left with too many unsold flags. “In general, we finish our stocks of Brazil and Germany’s flags first as they are the most popular teams in Lebanon. Next come the Italian and Argentine flags, and we don’t even bother getting the other flags,” says Zaynab El Hassan, manager of the toys purchasing section at Karout Grand Stores. She adds that with experience, they can now get almost the exact number of flags they need — around a hundred for each of the main countries — and not be left with any surplus.</p>
<p>Vendors are also careful not to invest in too many flags in case a team experiences an unexpected loss from the onset of the world cup and the rest goes into stock until the next international event. “You have to know football and make your calculations when you are buying flags or you will not make up for what you spent,” says Ramzi Aswad, an automobile accessories shop owner who also sells flags and novelty items during the World Cup season.</p>
<p>Despite their best efforts, most vendors end up with leftover flags after the championship, an outcome which most don’t mind as they say they can always resell them during the next World Cup or any international sporting event as “flags don’t change,” says Aswad. </p><div><a href="http://www.executive-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Flags-1.jpg"><img src="http://www.executive-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Flags-1.jpg" alt="World Cup flags" width="580" height="386"></a><span><a href="http://www.executive-magazine.com/author/greg-demarque">Greg Demarque</a> | Executive</span></div>
<p><strong>Competition around a competition</strong></p>
<p>Still, the desire to sell the biggest amount possible leads to an ‘early bird gets the worm’ situation with shop windows displaying all varieties of flags and memorabilia about a month and a half before the World Cup. “You have to be the first in your neighborhood to show your flags because people buy them only once in the season … and also because your display will then stick to their minds when they decide to buy a flag later on,” explains Saleh Jummaa, an owner of a grocery shop in Qoreitem which sells flags year-round but only promotes them during international events.</p>
<p>Flag prices vary according to the size and the country. The flags of the more widely available countries are sold at a lower price. In general, prices range from a dollar for a 50 centimeter flag from a street vendor up to $50 for a 3 meter German flag.</p>
<p>Fans of uncommonly supported countries such as Ghana or Uruguay will have to dish out extra cash and put more effort into finding the flag of the country they support. Jummaa, who has flags of all participating countries, explains he sells a meter long flag of Uruguay for $6 while he would sell the same sized flag of Brazil for half the price. “It is rare so of course it is more expensive,” he says, adding that he can custom make any flag requested for an extra charge.</p>
<p>Luckily for Lebanese optimists, the cedar flag should be in plentiful supply for years to come.</p>

In the big picture of Lebanese banking, the classic performance parameters are rather well behaved this year. Assets of commercial banks stood at $166.5 billion at the end of March according to Banque du Liban (BDL), Lebanon’s central bank — up by $1.68 billion from the end of 2013 and up by 7.1 percent year on year. Private sector deposits, which started 2014 with outflows after an atypically high inflow of more than $3 billion in December, returned to a more regularly paced increase of $840 million in March and ended the first quarter at $136.6 billion. This represented 6.6 percent growth when compared with the end of Q1 2013.</p>
<p>When widening the view over the previous 12 months, sector data were not staging any alarming deviations from their long-term growth trajectories either, as proven by the full-year data for 2013. In simple terms, growth of banking assets, deposits and loans did not go AWOL in the otherwise growth-averse economy of 2013.</p>
<p><strong>The banks’ good health </strong></p>
<div><p>“2014 is not going to be a year of profitability for the banking sector”</p>
</div>
<p>Economists of Lebanon’s top banks corroborated the story told by the numbers, describing banking sector growth up to the first quarter of 2014 as satisfactory overall. “The sector has been resilient to regional turmoil, and specifically Syrian turmoil, in terms of growth and financial soundness,” said Marwan Barakat, head of research at Bank Audi, citing growth of deposits in 2013 as 8.5 percent, or $13 billion.</p>
<p>This rate of growth was sufficient to meet the needs of Lebanon’s public and private sector borrowing, Barakat explained. “We need for our deposits to grow 5 percent [annually] in order to be able to provide loans to the public and private sector and thus meet the financing needs of the entire domestic economy. Despite the crisis that affected Lebanon for the past three years, deposits growth was above that mark and thus banks have been able to finance the economy while keeping liquidity at a good level.”</p>
<p>Not only was deposits growth commensurate with the nation’s financing needs, the lending activity of Lebanese banks was also good, said Marwan Mikhael, head of research at BLOM Bank. Total lending to the private sector at the end of February 2014 stood at $47 billion, up around 9 percent year on year and representing 28.5 percent of total banking assets, he said, putting the ratio into perspective of the domestic economy by enthusing, “It is not that we are not lending; our lending is at around 100 percent of GDP.”</p>
<p>Loan to deposits ratios (LDRs) of Lebanese banks, which stand around 35 percent for the sector according to Mikhael, often appear extra slim in comparison to most countries where LDRs of 80 to 100 percent are common. However, Lebanese bankers do not tire in explaining that this is only because the banking sector’s deposit base is more than three times GDP, meaning that the sector’s theoretical full lending power is too large for the size of the domestic economy.</p>
<p>Nassib Ghobril, chief economist of Byblos Bank, confirmed the positive sentiment in difficult economic terrain and summarized the state of Lebanese banks in 2014 as being still “very solid, very liquid, highly capitalized and very well managed.”</p>
<p>From a perspective of financial investments via the securities market, banking stocks look better than real estate, said the head of research at FFA Private Bank, Nadim Kabbara. “We as FFA Research currently favor the banking sector over the real estate sector. If someone told me, ‘I want to put money into the Lebanese capital markets,’ I would guide them more to the banking sector than to the real estate sector,” he said, explaining that “while real estate sector shares, namely Solidere, can be interesting to the patient, long-term investor, the economy has not been doing so well there. In the banking sector, at least we are seeing some growth of their balance sheets.”</p>
<p><strong>A wrench in the works</strong></p>
<div><p>the new taxation would be detrimental to the Lebanese economy and … could go as far as turning investors away from contributing to banks’ capitals because of lower return prospects</p>
</div>
<p>Noting the quiet nature of Lebanon’s stock market and given that the banking sector has, in the words of BLOM’s Mikhael, “been shielded to an extent from the slowdown in the Lebanese economy since 2011,” and is overall “the most stable sector in the entire economy,” this year’s banking narrative by Executive could have been less than engaging to most audiences.</p>
<p>But the sector’s story has developed an explosive potential in the past few weeks, ever since banks were targeted as a potential fount of revenue in filling the state’s gap in financing the salaries of Lebanese public servants (see “<a href="http://www.executive-magazine.com/opinion/leaders/dont-kill-banks" target="_blank">Don’t kill the banks</a>“). The fiscal desire to tap into banking profits to the tune of an extra $250 to $300 million via inventive taxation measures is the stuff for a great debate between <a href="http://www.executive-magazine.com/opinion/comment/banks-pay-yes" target="_blank">proponents</a> and <a href="http://www.executive-magazine.com/opinion/comment/banks-pay" target="_blank">opponents</a> of the plans.</p>
<p>Another bit of relevant news is the fact that FATCA, the US tax administration’s tentacle reaching out to American citizens around the world to ensure that they pay their dues back home, is scheduled to affect Lebanese banks beginning next month (see “<a href="http://www.executive-magazine.com/business-finance/finance/lebanon-financial-sector-braces-for-fatca" target="_blank">Lebanon’s financial sector braces for FATCA</a>“).</p>
<p>In terms of profit outlooks, compliance with an ever increasing number of international demands will cost banks a pretty penny, which comes on top of the taxation challenge which bankers perceive as discriminatory. In the opinions of every last banking insider queried by Executive in the past two months, the new taxation would be detrimental to the Lebanese economy and in the view of some experts could go as far as turning investors away from contributing to banks’ capitals because of lower return prospects. Some go so far as to argue the new measures might even discourage entrepreneurs in general because of the perceived injustice and unpredictability of tax innovations.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.executive-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/20140609-bank-profit-equity.png"><img src="http://www.executive-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/20140609-bank-profit-equity.png" alt="20140609-bank-profit-equity" width="580" height="275"></a></p>
<p><strong>Expectations for 2014</strong></p>
<p>These concerns notwithstanding, the banking sector’s outlook for 2014 is not hugely different from what was seen in the first quarter and in 2013 before that. “2014 is not going to be a year of profitability for the banking sector,” said Bank Audi’s Barakat, pointing out that net profits in the first two months of 2014 registered a 17 percent decline. He added that he does not expect this decline to continue but also does not expect an increase for full-year profits relative to 2013.</p>
<p>From Mikhael’s perspective, the Lebanese banking sector is stable and it is unlikely that there will be shocks affecting the sector in 2014. “There could be an uptick in the sector if there is stability that favors the economic performance of the whole country,” he said, adding that prospects for lending growth do exist but will depend on political stability and security. “Otherwise it will continue more or less like 2013.”</p>
<div><p>“It is not that we are not lending; our lending is at around 100 percent of GDP.”</p>
</div>
<p>Byblos’ Ghobril expects prospects for lending to be impacted by the complicated political schedule. He said, “If we ask where lending opportunities to the private sector will come from this year, you firstly don’t have many new major projects or greenfield foreign direct investment projects. The public private partnership law is on hold and Lebanon faces a whole series of political deadlines starting with the presidential elections that has to be followed by government formation, and then by parliamentary elections in November and yet another government formation,” adding that “these political deadlines tend to put businesses into wait-and-see mode.”</p>
<p>In his view, for new growth to occur it does not suffice that the past three years had been marked by weakening indicators on many fronts. “Some people have a theory that the current situation will favor growth from a very low base but I don’t subscribe to that,” he emphasized. “According to the latest surveys for the Bank Byblos/American University of Beirut Consumer Confidence Index, there was a small pickup in confidence levels in Q1 of 2014 but the current levels are still not sufficient.”</p>
<p><strong>Enough profitability?</strong></p>
<p>That leaves the question of expectations for profitability. FFA’s Kabbara voiced concern that stalling of economic growth in the past year has resulted in behavior of banks that was not perfectly conducive for higher profitability. “We are not seeing much growth in the balance sheets of banks in Lebanon from domestic activity, but we are seeing more competition that is putting pressure on interest margins because banks are competing to originate loans or obtain deposits. My concern is not so much on the funding side but more on the allocation side of that capital. Banks here are very conservative in nature and that has helped Lebanon during the past financial crisis, but we are also seeing a lot of the capital being deployed into short-term liquidity such as interbank placements or deposits and reserves at BDL. This is understandable but has impacted the bottom line of banks,” he said.</p>
<div><p>The chances for a groundbreaking change in Lebanese realities may be ultra-thin, but cannot be dismissed — and the banking sector cannot discount the possibility of positive change.</p>
</div>
<p>According to FFA research notes, which only cover the three largest Lebanese banks, Audi, BLOM and Byblos, first-quarter net profits of Audi and BLOM in year-on-year comparison were flat at $86 million and $88 million while Byblos net profits went down 11 percent year on year to $31 million. The three banks’ return on equity (RoE) ratios under a trailing twelve months methodology was estimated by FFA to be 9.2 percent for Byblos, around 11.1 percent for Audi and 15 percent for BLOM.</p>
<p>RoE ratios are watched by investors checking on the performance of their investments and are important for the Lebanese banking sector because RoE and similar ratios such as return on assets as well as asset quality measures such as the non-performing loans ratio are more indicative than headline growth figures on assets and deposits when it comes to assessing the profitability and health of a bank or listed company.</p>
<p>According to Barakat, the RoE ratios of the Lebanese banking sector, recently at 12 to 12.5 percent, have been “satisfactory but not high” when compared with emerging market and regional peers. Provisions for doubtful loans have gone up, “but not significantly,” he added. “The asset quality is still good with a non-performing loans ratio of 3.3 percent.”</p>
<p>Bank Audi’s economist nonetheless warned that the fall of RoE ratios over the past three years is cause for concern. “We need to maintain capitalization levels and to do so, we have to attract shareholders. If capitalization of banks is affected, the attractiveness for deposits could be affected, and deposits are important to have the financial means to finance the deficit,” Barakat explained.</p>

<p><strong>Impact of Fed’s new rates</strong></p>
<p>The Lebanese profitability ratios have been impacted by factors that include the cost of maintaining high liquidity in an international interest rate environment that has been kept low by the policy of the US Federal Reserve for more than five years. As this scenario will likely start to change in 2015 based on the Fed’s recent announcements, Barakat said he expects the environment of increasing interest rates to allow Lebanon’s banks to hike their profitability. “We are going to improve our yield on assets while our cost of funding, which is what we are paying on our deposits, will increase, but not at the same pace. Accordingly we will be able to improve our interest margins and spreads starting in 2015,” he said.</p>

<p>Ghobril concurred that Lebanese banks are on the lookout for interest rates to start moving up. But he noted also that the Fed’s anticipated changes in interest rate policies take on a different and potentially much riskier dimension under a macroeconomic angle. “Since 2008 the international interest rate environment was not very favorable for our banks to place liquidity in international markets because interest rates are near zero, but this environment was favorable for managing Lebanon’s public finances,” he said.</p>
<p>“If the Fed starts increasing interest rates as planned sometime in 2015, the increase first of all appears set to be very gradual and there will be no direct effect on liquidity placements of local banks and there also will be a time lag between the rise of interest rates in the US and the arrival of higher rates in Lebanon. But we have to be ready. The years of near-zero interest rates will soon be over and we have to be prepared for it,” Ghobril cautioned (see “<a href="http://www.executive-magazine.com/opinion/leaders/fiscal-flood" target="_blank">Fiscal flood</a>“).</p>
<p>In the opinion of BLOM’s Mikhael, the scenario for Lebanon’s economy in the short term does not extend to a recession. He told Executive that “around one percent” of real GDP growth in 2014 is his worst-case expectation if the security and political situation do not make progress. A benign environment of domestic stability could in the best case generate 2.5 to 3 percent growth this year and 4 to 5 percent growth in 2015, he said, because even under a positive scenario of domestic political improvements and reforms in public finance, growth will take some time to materialize.</p>
<p><strong>Web of dependencies</strong></p>
<p>The chances for a groundbreaking change in Lebanese realities may be ultra-thin, but cannot be dismissed — and the banking sector cannot discount the possibility of positive change. Rebuilding in Syria, if peace were possible in 2015, would generate new opportunities for the banking sector and the economy in general.</p>
<p>In long-term context of the banking sector’s evolution, 2013 and the year to date reflect that the sector exists in a web of double cross-dependencies with opposing aspects. On the one hand, the sector’s need for a stable domestic operating environment and monetary stability mandates careful management of the relationship with the Lebanese state and its financing needs. On the other hand, the need to act internationally becomes more critical each year, from having to attract both capitalization and deposits to the survival necessities of deploying assets into profitable foreign operations and to being able to interact with the global banking system even in the presence of growing compliance demands.</p>
<p>The costs of both dependencies are significant and the entire sector is feeling them more strongly in 2014 than perhaps in some previous periods. But this is the price that will not disappear.</p>
