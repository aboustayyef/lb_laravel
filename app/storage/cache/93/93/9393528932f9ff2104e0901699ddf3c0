The focus has been on convincing the main Maronite candidates to withdraw in favor of someone who is acceptable to all, an approach regarded as the key to ending the current stalemate.</p><p>With all the attention on the Maronites, relatively little consideration has been given to Hezbollah, which remains the most influential elector in  Lebanon and, with Iran, perhaps in the region. Conveniently for Hezbollah, the Maronite rivalry has filled the foreground, and may continue to do so for some time. But it is the background, and Hezbollah’s interests, that may tell us what the ultimate outcome will be in the presidency.</p><p>For some time Hezbollah  has viewed the Lebanese situation as part and parcel of the Syrian situation. The party always considered its success in strengthening Syrian President Bashar Assad  as a check that also had to be cashed in Lebanon. As Assad consolidates in Syria,  Hezbollah intends to do the same at home, where the Syrian civil war repeatedly gave hope to the party’s domestic foes that its domination could be challenged. </p><p>With  Hezbollah now believing that the tide has turned in Syria, it is moving ahead with this project. The party did two things last year to prepare the ground. It pushed for an extension of Jean Kahwagi’s term as Army commander, in order to maintain his relevance in the presidential pre-election period, even though this angered Michel Aoun, who had hoped his son-in-law, Shamel Roukoz, would replace Kahwagi. And  Hezbollah worked to delay parliamentary elections – partly by having another ally, Nabih Berri, divisively push for an impossible agreement over an election law, partly by going along with the argument that the security situation did not permit an election. </p><p>With these two pieces in place,  Hezbollah bought valuable time to go on the offensive in Syria, playing a vital role in helping Assad’s forces recapture the Qalamoun district. In that way it cut off the link between Syria  and  Lebanon and reinforced the Syrian regime’s hold over the communications lines between Damascus and Homs, and Homs and the Syrian coast. </p><p>Kahwagi has been Hezbollah’s candidate from the start, and very little appears to have changed in its position. The party always expected a mash-up between the Maronite presidential contenders, so it was a question of maneuvering around this for a time, even if it perpetuated a temporary vacuum, while setting up the conditions for the election of its nominee.</p><p>That’s why Aoun, who is perfectly aware of Hezbollah’s plan, has been so busy trying to make himself relevant to both the party and to Walid Jumblatt, who can hand him a majority. The recent leak to Al-Joumhouria, in which Aoun said that it was necessary to accept the fact that Assad could win in Syria, was directed at the first; his statement that he would participate in elections on the basis of the 1960 law was aimed at the second. </p><p>Part of Aoun’s implicit message to the Future Movement has derived from this logic: Either you vote for me, or you will have to face a  Hezbollah candidate. Today Aoun’s insistence on blocking any compromise figure is directed even more against  Hezbollah than it is against March 14, since once the principle of compromise is accepted, Kahwagi’s chances will go up, bolstered by the fact that the Army commander has led successful security plans in Tripoli and the Bekaa Valley. </p><p>That’s why Samir Geagea’s accusation on Wednesday that Aoun was responsible for blocking the election was music to Hezbollah’s ears. Only if inter-Christian rivalries rise can all the principal candidates be discredited, opening the door to a  Hezbollah candidate. But Aoun, for all his stubbornness and opportunism, is not the main issue. The issue is Hezbollah’s agenda. In this context we should look ahead at the second part of the party’s plan, namely winning the parliamentary elections. </p><p> Hezbollah believes, with good reason, that March 14 will not win a majority in the forthcoming elections. Even on the basis of the 1960 law, the breakdown of parliamentary seats will probably be roughly similar to what it is today, with Jumblatt retaining a balancing role. That is why  Hezbollah wants to preserve its relationship with Aoun, whatever their momentary disagreements over the presidency.</p><p>Aoun, too, has an interest in preserving a good relationship with the party. Even if he doesn’t become president, he would retain significant power as head of the largest Christian bloc. And for that to happen, Aoun needs Hezbollah’s Shiite votes in several key districts, particularly Baabda, Jbeil and Jezzine.</p><p>The potential loser in all this is March 14. The coalition took its hardest knock when Jumblatt headed for the political center. It’s possible this will lose him two Druze seats in the West Bekaa and Beirut. But then again both Jumblatt and Saad Hariri may benefit from reconciling. Jumblatt has as much to gain by securing Sunni votes as Aoun does by winning Shiite votes. As for Hariri, he only loses by alienating Jumblatt.</p><p>How might  Hezbollah set up a Kahwagi victory? It’s difficult to say. There are those who argue that as there is a vacuum today, no constitutional amendment is needed to bring the Army commander to office. That’s imaginative. Some fear the party will manipulate the security situation to make Kahwagi more appealing. Whatever happens the situation will have to fester until the mood is ripe for Hezbollah’s chosen solution.</p><p>Kahwagi’s candidacy will also need Sunni backing. Unless the Saudis give a green light to their Lebanese allies, the general will face serious obstacles in his path. The weeks ahead will reveal what the presidential election is really about, and they will better expose Hezbollah’s role in preparing for its preferred end game. </p><p>Michael Young is opinion editor of THE DAILY STAR.

Though he was not necessarily advocating Washington&#x2019;s actions, what he presented revealed the incomprehensibility of the American strategy towards Iran and the Arab world, Syria in particular.</p><p>Explaining why the United States had not exploited the opportunity to severely weaken Iran in the Levant by helping to push President Bashar Al Assad out of office in 2011 and 2012, the former official presented what, by now, has become a familiar refrain: the administration, facing a major economic crisis, did not have the latitude or desire to act in Syria.</p><p>Moreover, in this regard the American public was unwilling to approve of any intervention in the Arab world, even if there were many more options than deploying ground troops.  </p><p>When asked about whether the US viewed Iran as a strategic rival in the Middle East, the official said it did. In other words, there is clear recognition in Washington of the power stakes in the region and no effort to minimise this.</p><p>When the former official was queried about whether a nuclear deal with Iran might open the door to a broader American dialogue with the Islamic Republic over regional issues, the answer was &#x201c;probably not&#x201d;. With American midterm elections looming and suspicion of Iran high in Congress, anything seen as ignoring the Iranian danger could hurt President Barack Obama. </p><p>There was nothing here that hadn&#x2019;t been said before. And yet, putting the implications together, what was the message? That the Obama administration does view Iran as a major foe in the Middle East, but that it preferred to do nothing about it in Syria (though it was willing to make an effort in Libya). That while Mr Obama today considers terrorism emanating from Syria as a major threat to America, he failed to fill the dangerous vacuum in the country when he was specifically warned that it might lead to the emergence of jihadist groups.</p><p>The former official had a point in saying that once engaged in Syria, the US could not simply hand the problem off to someone else once its goals were achieved, namely Mr Al Assad&#x2019;s removal. The complexity of the Syrian situation meant that some sort of medium-term commitment was necessary.</p><p>Perhaps, but the impression was that the Obama administration is mostly unwilling to make any effort in the region, even if this has negative strategic implications. There is a great disconnect between the perceived importance of the regional challenge posed by Iran and America&#x2019;s willingness to respond to it. </p><p>It has often been said that the Iranians play chess while the Americans play checkers. But these days, the Obama administration seems hardly to be playing at all. Even though it is in dire financial straits, Iran has gone all the way on behalf of Mr Al Assad. The Obama administration, though assisting the Syrian opposition would have cost much less, refused to do so.</p><p>Syria may be more vital to Iran than it is to America, but that again raises the initial question: What is the Obama administration&#x2019;s assessment of Iranian power in the region? If Iran has to be contained &#x2013; and negotiations over Iran&#x2019;s nuclear programme suggests it does &#x2013; then can this be done if the US is so reluctant to take on any regional respons&#xad;ibility?</p><p>The lack of commitment on the part of Mr Obama &#x2013; indeed, what appears to be his utter lack of interest &#x2013; will have profound implications for the Middle East in the foreseeable future and perhaps beyond. America&#x2019;s allies are already preparing for a post-American period in the region, with some even wondering whether it is not time to arrive at some sort of understanding with Iran.</p><p>As long as the Saudis and other Gulf countries view Iranian influence as an existential threat, such a process may be limited. But even Saudi Arabia seems to have accepted the implications of American abandonment &#x2013; and that word is not too strong. The recent Saudi invitation to Iran&#x2019;s foreign minister to visit the kingdom may be the first step in an effort to peacefully coexist with the Islamic Republic in light of this.  </p><p>In Lebanon, similar dynamics may also take shape. In lieu of open-ended confrontation, the Sunni community, following the Saudi lead if the kingdom warms up to Iran, may see a similar benefit in improving relations with Hizbollah. The formation of a national-unity government earlier this year, apparently sanctioned by the Saudis and Iranians, showed the relative advantages of a process of sectarian normalisation.</p><p>But one should not be naive. There is nothing heartfelt in adapting to a new reality of power in the region. Quite simply, America&#x2019;s allies in the region believe that the Obama administration has no will to pursue its obvious interests, and therefore they are going their own way. And when they hear Washington&#x2019;s weak rationale for its minimalism, this only confirms to them that the US is not likely to soon change.</p><p>Is that what Mr Obama wants? Does he feel that America has entered a new phase in the region and that there is no going back to the past? American officials may not admit as much, but the Arab states have already made up their mind. Iran is making headway and no one can rely on America to prevent this.  </p><p>Michael Young is opinion editor of The Daily Star newspaper in Beirut</p><p>On Twitter: @BeirutCalling </p>";s:17:"post_image_height";i:0;s:16:"post_image_width";i:0;s:11:"post_visits";i:0;s:18:"post_twitterShares";i:4;s:19:"post_facebookShares";i:2;s:16:"post_totalShares";i:6;s:16:"post_socialScore";i:7;s:13:"post_virality";i:14;s:9:"blog_name";N;s:16:"blog_description";N;s:8:"blog_url";N;s:11:"blog_author";N;s:28:"blog_author_twitter_username";N;s:13:"blog_rss_feed";N;s:9:"blog_tags";N;s:2:"id";N;s:11:"blog_active";N;s:24:"blog_last_post_timestamp";N;s:6:"col_id";i:7;s:8:"col_name";s:29:"Michael Young at The National";s:16:"col_media_source";s:12:"The National";s:13:"col_home_page";s:109:"http://www.thenational.ae/apps/pbcs.dll/search?q=*&NavigatorFilter=[Byline:Michael%20Young]&BuildNavigators=1";s:13:"col_shorthand";s:8:"myoungtn";s:26:"col_media_source_shorthand";s:12:"the_national";s:27:"col_author_twitter_username";s:13:"beirutcalling";s:8:"col_tags";s:20:"columnists, politics";s:15:"col_description";s:50:"Michael Young is opinion editor of THE DAILY STAR.";s:23:"col_last_post_timestamp";i:1404314164;}i:2;O:8:"stdClass":36:{s:7:"post_id";i:30739;s:8:"post_url";s:72:"http://www.executive-magazine.com/buzz/negative-experiences-country-rank";s:10:"post_title";s:17:"Measuring anguish";s:10:"post_image";s:95:"http://www.executive-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Two-face-buddha-e1401884179155.jpg";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:123:"Remember happiness?

When the <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.executive-magazine.com%2Fbuzz%2Fcompetition-happiness-rankings&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNGNUaP_tgeHPzEXRUcx6fzFvhNUlQ">Positive Experience Index (PEI)</a> of 138 countries was released last month by global opinion surveying organization Gallup, Executive noted how Syria’s war had wrecked havoc on its people’s positive emotions and sense of happiness.</p>
<p>Now we have the pain test. In its just-released <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gallup.com%2Fpoll%2F170819%2Fhappiness-short-supply-iran.aspx&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNHBRkl2Bj2VA6BbbGSdREYeEr3lUQ">Negative Experience Index (NEI)</a>, Gallup measured the prevalence of negative emotions, and it shows a very clear and unenviable clustering of bad vibes in the Middle East and North Africa. According to the 2013 NEI, half of the ten most emotionally downtrodden countries — where people told surveyors they felt anger, stress, pain and worry the day prior — were in MENA. The rest of this unenviable top ten list was comprised of one country in each Asia and Africa, and three jurisdictions in Europe’s eastern Mediterranean.</p>
<p>Iraq led the ranking on negative experiences, followed by Iran. Egypt and Greece were tied in third place, ahead of Syria. Lebanon made the tenth spot in the NEI, where a higher rank indicates that more people felt negative emotions.</p>
<p>In similar fashion, the PEI had ranked countries by translating the number of ‘yes’ answers to positive-emotions questions into an index score. The two indices are not, however, inverses of each other. Syria’s fifth place finish in the NEI did not mirror its last place finish in the PIE; similarly, while Iraqis reported more negative emotions than anyone else, they also reported more positive emotions than those in 23 other locations.</p>
<p>In presenting the NEI findings, Gallup placed a strong emphasis on Iran’s lack of happiness, opining that “Iranians have every right to feel negative, given the high unemployment coupled with high inflation in their country that has crippled their ability to provide for their families, along with international sanctions over their nuclear program that have hurt their livelihoods.”</p>
<p>But while Iran ranked highly on the NEI, the Islamic republic actually scored 63 points in the PEI, placing it in the lower middle field of countries and tied with Luxembourg, South Korea, Kazakhstan and Czech Republic. It clearly underperformed on a global scale, but within the region compared favorably to both Syria and Iraq.</p>
<p>In short, emotions are complicated — and at times, seemingly contradictory.</p>

Executive sat down for an interview with Dany Baz, Bankdata’s general manager, to enhance our understanding of the latest developments in the sector.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What is your most striking impression from recent data on banking in Lebanon?</strong></p>
<p>What strikes me first is once again the resilience of the banking sector that was able to maintain a satisfactory performance despite the increasingly tough operating conditions. The banks that have chosen to expand regionally have handled the downturn in neighboring countries with minimal impact on their financial strength and performance, while banks that focused on the domestic market have had to face the slowdown of the Lebanese economy and the increasingly competitive operating conditions and have also managed to keep up.</p>
<p>Another striking fact is that there are pockets of opportunities for banks domestically, as some segments are under-borrowed; the SME [small and medium enterprise] sector for instance has also shown resilience versus the economic slowdown. Many of these enterprises have also decided to go cross border and have done so successfully.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>How does the under-borrowing of SMEs affect us?</strong></p>
<p>On a global level, the economy is running at a much slower pace than it should be. Companies in the category of small and medium enterprises, meaning SMEs with more than 5 and up to 150 employees, number approximately 20,000 companies that generate around $5 billion of annual turnover. If you take into consideration that there are something like 200,000 registered establishments, this shows that these 10 percent of enterprises generate around 10 percent of Lebanon’s GDP [of $43 billion]. Interestingly, only over a third of these SMEs are borrowers and their borrowings amount to around $2 billion of various loans and facilities. If this ratio is raised to 50 percent, it would represent about $600 million of untapped business for banks over the upcoming years.</p>
<p> </p>
<div><p>There is quite a lot that the banks are doing for the economy and they should not be penalized because of the transparency they have adopted. </p>
</div>
<p><strong>Currently, with debates over profits and taxes of banks, it seems that the banker is everyone’s favorite villain. Do they deserve it?</strong></p>
<p>Banks are traditionally the driving force behind economic growth and consequently contribute to the welfare of citizens. Obviously, banks are profit-oriented organizations and are definitely into improving their profitability and shareholder value. But I think you can say that of any venture and in some businesses, like the food industry where you can poison people, you have many more ethical concerns than in the money or service business.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Are banks paying enough taxes? </strong></p>
<p>They are the biggest taxpayers in the country. They contribute more than one third of all taxes on profit and bank employees contribute nearly 30 percent of all payroll taxes in Lebanon. Banks settled about $400 million in taxes in 2012. Tell me one sector that is doing the same. I think banks are the number one employer, the number one taxpayer, and they don’t even recoup VAT [value added tax]. There is quite a lot that the banks are doing for the economy and they should not be penalized because of the transparency they have adopted. Tax evasion is estimated at $3 billion yearly, i.e. 7 percent of GDP — this is where the real change should take place.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>In your opinion, would a permanent increase in the taxation rate of banks impact the economy?</strong></p>
<p>I honestly don’t think that raising [VAT] by 2 percentage points is going to rock the boat. The problem is that the economy is in a slowdown and there is very little leeway for the government today. In a different context, I don’t think 2 percent would make a difference. But today nothing [in terms of tax increase] is acceptable.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>That is on VAT in general. But how about the specific taxes on banks that have been proposed?</strong></p>
<p>When you have a sector that is vital for the economy, you don’t want to burden it in times such as these. In my view, everything that was discussed is acceptable and I am sure even the banks will say that — but is it acceptable today? No.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What would you consider as a minimum healthy growth rate and prudent performance indicator for the banking sector?</strong></p>
<p>The IMF estimates a 5 percent growth in customer deposits is the minimum required to finance public and private borrowing needs. I wouldn’t take the growth of assets as a measure for the health of banks. I would take the return on equity. Today we are at just over 12 percent in return on equity and this is low if we take a look at other financial sectors in MENA countries. Everybody will expect the ratio to be closer to 20 percent.</p>
<p> </p>
<div><p>Tax evasion is estimated at $3 billion yearly, i.e. 7 percent of GDP — this is where the real change should take place</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Bankdata is the organization that initiated categorization of banks according to deposits. What is the rationale for making the distinction between alpha, beta, gamma and delta group banks?</strong></p>
<p>Segmentation helps external people and the bankers themselves to benchmark against banks of the same size with comparable operating conditions in terms of network and staff, for instance. You have to compare apples to apples: the purpose was to facilitate comparisons.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>You raised the threshold of financial size for the alpha banks to $2 billion in deposits quite a while back. When was that and why is it prudent to keep it at that level still today?</strong></p>
<p>We raised it in 2004 so it will be ten years this year. We review it every year to see if a change in the definition of categories is warranted but if the difference [between the old and new deposit size benchmark] is around 10 percent, it is not worth [changing] it. The issue is to have a look at the even distribution of the four categories and not just the top banks.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Your company is regarded as the authority on measuring the performance of Lebanese banks. Should that be done by a private sector company, or rather by a government agency?</strong></p>
<p>I don’t think it is the purpose of the regulator to publish market shares and ranks but rather to monitor compliance and follow up on performance. We are much more flexible in our approach and have two-way communication with the banks, which is not something that you would have if you were addressing this from the public sector.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>How confident are you that the information you publish is accurate, especially on some highly watched ratios where people might want to look better than they are?</strong></p>
<p>They cannot because we have our own controls, both specific and general. Of course there are human errors and if we see a growth rate by a bank that is incoherent on any criteria, even if it is a small item on the balance sheet, we immediately call the bank. And if there is a correction in one bank, we call 70 banks to align. This is our added value.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>How many items do you check each time when you review the banking performance?</strong></p>
<p>That is an interesting question and I have never looked at it this way. (Consults briefly with staff.) We review 410 items times 70 banks times two because we control two years in every edition [of the Bilanbanques yearbook]. That means we cover 57,000 pieces of data for every edition.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Do you do that for the love of numbers?</strong></p>
<p>No, for the love of credibility.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>How did the concept occur to you?</strong></p>
<p>This is a company that was founded by my husband, Freddie [Baz]. He started it 32 years ago because this is his forte and I learned the job. The methodology and the continuous enhancement and update of the methodology rely a lot on him but I have been running the show.</p>
<p> </p>
<div><p>Some banks provide unpublished figures and if they request for them not to be published, they will never be published or made available to anybody</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Are there any conflicts of interest for Bankdata because of the fact that your husband is a senior executive at the top bank in Lebanon?</strong></p>
<p>When he first started with [Bank] Audi, he was merely an adviser and there was no particular drawback. At some point, perhaps other banks might have felt a conflict of interest but they have realized that this is not the case. We cannot twist figures in any way. In addition, the fact that he combines macro and micro views and experience are a plus to continuously update and enhance our methodology.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>So you would not provide information exclusively or faster to one bank than any other?</strong></p>
<p>I would be shooting myself in the foot, honestly. The open climate that we have with the banks is based on them knowing that we are very keen on preserving [confidentiality]. They trust us with their figures. Some banks provide unpublished figures and if they request for them not to be published, they will never be published or made available to anybody.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What valuation do you attribute to the company that you manage?</strong></p>
<p>Bankdata is a profitable company, but it is not a company that will crush records of profitability. We are a service company and also do consulting and have very decent revenue. We have invested into our platform but if I were to value the qualitative part of it and not the multiples, the benefit to the sector is really priceless.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Are you a family business?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, we are.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Do you have succession planning?</strong></p>
<p>We should (laughs). Probably [the succession] will not be in the family, so we would have to transform.</p>

The launch was announced Tuesday by David Munir Nabti, CEO of Lebanese startup space <a href="http://www.altcity.me/" target="_blank">AltCity</a>.</p>
<p>Choosing the afternoon of the first day of ArabNet Digital Summit 2014 in Dubai to unveil the new group, Nabti explains that MEGAplay is an initiative to help Middle Eastern startups take advantage of the appetite for games in the Middle East. “Gaming is a huge sector regionally, but startups are not tapping into that,” he says.</p>
<p>Nabti announced that MEGAplay will provide various support to gaming startups. It will offer workshops — both online and offline — using expert know-how to put regional companies on a more competitive footing in a global market <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.newzoo.com%2Fpress-releases%2Fnewzoo-announces-new-report-and-projects-global-games-market-to-grow-6-to-70-4bn-in-2013%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNEUOKEom-aotVL2ue8PzOngAMcS0A">worth perhaps $70 billion</a>. The idea is “to help people start games [and] develop new concepts that are at the leading edge of trends, rather than behind the curve,” says Nabti. It will also hold competitions and help connect startups to investors.</p>
<p>MEGAplay is the brainchild of AltCity, with seed funding from the Netherlands Embassy in Lebanon. The initiative builds on AltCity’s involvement in gaming events in Beirut, as well as its lighter dabbling in the region. One such event was the group’s <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.altcity.me%2Flebanese-app-and-game-developers-develop-working-versions-in-less-than-12-hours%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNF2dnR6LaHt0Qb5ehaCV38R2E2ylw" target="_blank">Beirut hackathon</a> on May 3, which brought together developers, designers and entrepreneurs to build mobile apps and games within a 12 hour time frame.</p>
<p>But gaming is also a notoriously tough industry. An often cited example is the story behind Angry Birds, where Finnish developer Rovio <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.wired.co.uk%2Fmagazine%2Farchive%2F2011%2F04%2Ffeatures%2Fhow-rovio-made-angry-birds-a-winner&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNFFYnKMATuFpO6253T6NGMuR4Q7Ug">failed 51 times</a> at creating a viral game before producing an overnight success. This makes gaming startups inherently risky.</p>
<p>And regionally, the sector is <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.wamda.com%2F2013%2F11%2Foverview-gaming-sector-arab-world&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNEUKuCKcLiLMTgLQDafaRBoIbx8MA">quickly evolving</a>, with promising names such as Jordan’s Taktek <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.wamda.com%2F2013%2F01%2Fwhy-jordanian-gaming-company-taktek-closed&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNHAxHPa5EdH2uDkJYUy7TQwRPCCIg">fizzling</a>. Walid Hanna, managing partner at regional venture capital firm Middle East Venture Partners, told Executive in December that while the group had invested in gaming startups, they were trying to refrain from investing in them in the future because of the uncertainty of business.</p>
<p>When presented with these concerns, Nabti remains convinced of the potential of the market. He explains that the volatile nature of the business makes it all the more important how companies build themselves, learn to appreciate risk and increase their chances of success by developing the best methods.</p>
<p>“Gaming is already a huge market, and is becoming more connected to people’s lives,” he says, even to the point of overtaking cinema and TV.</p>

It offers important new possibilities, if key actors respond reasonably, rather than hysterically. </p><p>The new government’s own policies will be telling of what it might portend for the Palestinians’ hopes of ending the Israeli occupation and siege of the West Bank and Gaza  through negotiations, and moving toward the birth of a viable independent state. The most critical criterion of its success or failure will be its ability to achieve a series of priorities for the Palestinians in the occupied territories and in the diaspora. These include forging a stronger sense of genuine unity among Palestinians, holding parliamentary elections in six months’ time, improving day-to-day living conditions in the occupied territories, and shaping a clear diplomatic and resistance policy vis-à-vis Israel  that is supported by a strong majority of Palestinians acting politically through the revived Palestine Liberation Organization. </p><p>This government came into being because the separate policies of both Fatah  in the West Bank and Hamas  in  Gaza had reached a dead end, and both groups had been steadily losing support and even legitimacy among Palestinians. Fatah’s bold policy under President Mahmoud Abbas  of negotiating endlessly with  Israel in the context of Washington’s Israel-leaning mediation proved fruitless. Hamas’ policy of armed resistance and building institutions at home also failed to improve living conditions and opportunities for ordinary citizens. </p><p>Israel’s reaction has been predictably hostile, promising not to deal with the new government and to impose punishment. We have been through this before, without any meaningful results from the Israeli boycott. Ironically,  Israel is now in the same position the Arab world assumed in September 1970, when Arab leaders declared at the Khartoum summit, “No peace with Israel, no recognition of Israel, no negotiations with it.” </p><p>Now  Israel is the side that rejects dealing with the other, even though its own government is composed of several right-wing parties that represent a majority of Israelis. Some of these Israeli parties in the government also reject the idea of a sovereign Palestinian state, yet they expect the world to deal with them unconditionally.</p><p>The reactions of the United States  and the European Union  to the new government will be the most important to watch in the short run. Initial signs that the U.S. and EU will deal with the Palestinian government suggest the rest of the world will follow suit, leaving  Israel badly isolated and wallowing in its own vindictiveness.</p><p>The U.S. wisely and reasonably said it would judge the Palestinian government on the basis of its policies, acknowledging that its Israeli-induced boycott of the Hamas-led government following the 2006 elections was a mistake. Washington, the Europeans and others have also said they expect the new government to adhere to international principles, including recognizing Israel, renouncing violence and respecting previous Palestinian-Israeli agreements. The new government has stated it will do so, though  Hamas rejects some of these principles. </p><p> Hamas has sensibly stated for years that it would respect any peace agreement ratified by a majority of Palestinians, and would back a unity government of technocrats that tests the diplomatic waters. It did so because it is convinced that a negotiated peace with  Israel is not possible, given the current imbalance of power and coalition of right-wing Zionists that rules Israel.</p><p>The Palestinian government’s adherence to the three principles related to its ties with Israel, with the agreement of all major political groups, may put new pressure on  Israel to show if it, too, is committed to these three principles. The rising tide of international criticism, and even boycotts, of Israeli conduct in the occupied territories has already sharpened the focus on the criminal nature of Zionist conduct vis-à-vis the Palestinians, in the form of assassinations, sieges, annexation, colonization, collective punishment and other nasty policies carried out by the Israeli government and army. The new Palestinian government’s commitment to negotiating a peace agreement and honoring existing agreements will only further isolate  Israel and force its citizens to decide whether their present right-wing coalition government accurately reflects their views.</p><p>Much of what happens now will depend on the steps the new Palestinian government will take. Its commitment to a peaceful resolution of the conflict suggests that its first priority should be to clarify the implications and purpose of the 2002 Arab Peace Plan, which remains on the table but has never elicited a serious Israeli response. This could be the most effective way toward achieving the main priorities of the new government: forging a strong national consensus, revitalizing the inputs of diaspora Palestinians in national decision-making and mobilizing the significant international support that exists for the Palestinian cause. </p><p>Rami G.

A typical Lebanese business model is to test a product in Lebanon before scaling to the region. This reflects at once the limits of the very small Lebanese market, but also the increasing nature of seeking solutions that cover the entire Arab world.</p>
<p>Besides catering to the region, Lebanese companies are increasingly drawn to Dubai, an important regional hub for big businesses and the Middle Eastern capital of marketing and advertising. The move is a logical expansion for a Lebanese company — some relocating their businesses there altogether.</p>
<p>Likewise, <a href="https://arabnet.me/" target="_blank">ArabNet</a> — a hub and conference organizer for digital entrepreneurs and professionals in the Arab world — expanded from its birthplace in Beirut to Dubai. The move was very successful: its Dubai event is now larger the original Beirut conference. This is due partly because of the political situation in Lebanon and partly because Dubai, being the business hub that it is today, is an attractive destination for regional companies to mingle. When Executive caught up with ArabNet founder Omar Christidis before March’s ArabNet Beirut, <a href="http://www.executive-magazine.com/business-finance/business/omar-christidis-arabnet-interview-startups" target="_blank">he explained</a> that while the Lebanon event focused on the local Levantine market as a production hub for the region, the Dubai event would be more focused on big business.</p>
<p>Indeed, the conference will highlight many aspects of big businesses — the latest trends in e-commerce, marketing and advertising from industry leaders. But entrepreneurs also have a selection of talks to choose from for promoting startup ecosystems in the region — with the government-owned tech park <a href="https://www.dsoa.ae/en/about-dso.jsp" target="_blank">Dubai Silicon Oasis</a>, local i360 accelerator’s space <a href="http://i360accelerator.com/" target="_blank">The Cribb</a> and the digital startup incubator <a href="http://afkar.me/" target="_blank">Afkar</a> among others represented.</p>
<p>Exhibitions and a digital showcase will highlight businesses big and small, creating opportunities for the two to liaise. Larger companies such as transportation and logistics company Aramex, market research company IPSOS and online payment gateway Gate2Play will be represented alongside smaller ones. Some of these smaller businesses were present at the Beirut event, such as animation company <a href="http://wezank.com/" target="_blank">Wezank</a> and social media topic analyzer tool Crowd Analyzer — which made the list of <a href="http://www.executive-magazine.com/business-finance/business/top-startup-pitches-arabnet" target="_blank">Executive’s favorite startups</a> from ArabNet Beirut.</p>
<p>The combination of panels where industry leaders share best practices and startups showcase the newest technological innovations makes ArabNet the epicenter of tech and entrepreneurship in the region for the next three days. Stay tuned for Executive’s coverage of ArabNet Digital Summit Dubai.</p>

Last week, <a href="http://www.executive-magazine.com/business-finance/finance/creditbank-on-the-lending-prowl">Executive published a longer piece about Creditbank</a>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The impression from our conversation on Creditbank is that you neither aim to be the richest banker in town nor are angling for the biggest bragging rights. Why are you a banker?</strong></p>
<p>I don’t regard myself only as a banker. If you think of yourself as a banker, you reduce yourself to calculating your margin on every transaction. I like to think of myself as a common denominator in the business world where people need a financier.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>How do you define the difference? </strong></p>
<p>Being a financier is more than being a banker. People think of a banker as someone who gets a lick of every deal that passes under his nose. This is not the picture that I have. If you asked me what I think of Creditbank, I would tell you that Creditbank is catering to people who are producing. If you are involved in banking in Lebanon today and like it, it is because you think everything is undervalued.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Undervalued in what way? </strong></p>
<p>I think everything in Lebanon could be at a higher and better value. This is the confidence that we have in this market and this is why we still lend to people in this market. If we didn’t believe that tomorrow would be brighter than today, we would not be taking the exposure to the private sector [that we are taking]. By taking private sector exposure, we are saying “I would rather take the upside of the private sector than the fixed return I can get on sovereign risk.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>How does the risk of private sector exposure correlate with your strategy for seeking growth?</strong></p>
<p>Going to a restaurant, hospital, clinic and retailer [as their lender] is saying that I am investing in the goodwill of all these operations and in their relationship with me. When [these businesses] are going to be bigger and more successful, I will grow [with them] because I have taken the risk in the bad days. It makes sense to us because we believe that there is an upside to the market. Lebanon can only [go up] in the future and the private sector is going to benefit from many things. We believe in this economy and the people that are the talent and the resource. As a bank you have to have the right morality vis-à-vis the client and the right productivity to reply to his needs. If you have those two, then you have a success.</p>

However, the factors underlying the market movements remained unchanged: Influences of MSCI classification drove three markets in the Gulf while political developments ruled in Egypt. On the weekly balance, four MENA exchanges were flat, six were up and two dropped.</p>
<p><strong>Egypt’s election<br></strong></p>
<p>The Egyptian Exchange traded up at the start of the week and reached a new post-Arab Spring high intraday on Monday before retreating. After the market closed on Tuesday, the EGX 30 weakened further on Wednesday while the predicted presidential win of former army leader Abdel Fattah al-Sisi was sealed on an unplanned third day of voting. Indications such as provision of free public transport on that day and threats of fines for non-voters suggested that the voting period was extended in order to increase participation and strengthen the appearance of legitimacy of Sisi’s mandate.</p>
<p>With Sisi’s win, the EGX 30 started Thursday with gains but then reversed, ending the day with a 3.5 percent drop due to news that the cabinet was preparing to levy a 10 percent capital gains tax on stock market investors. <a href="http://af.reuters.com/article/egyptMarketNews/idAFL6N0OF3E220140529?sp=true" target="_blank">Media reports</a> on Thursday gave the impression that the information arrived out of the blue, first spread in local media and then confirmed by finance minister Hany Dimian in an interview with Reuters.</p>
<p>The same day, the Egyptian Exchange posted an announcement it attributed to the finance ministry. The <a href="http://www.egx.com.eg/english/NewsDetails.aspx?NewsID=127360" target="_blank">one-sentence statement</a> said “Reference [sic] to what has been circulated about imposing taxes on capital gains achieved in the Egyptian Exchange, ministry of finance confirmed that the calculation of the tax on profits will be on the net value of the market capitalization portfolio by the end of year, compared to its value at the date of approving that law regardless of the purchase date preceding this law, taking into consideration to relay any losses achieved by the investor for the coming 3 years.”</p>
<p>Curiously, attempts to introduce a capital gains tax first on initial public offerings and then on incomes from share sales were twice announced and dropped in Egypt’s recent past — in December 2012 and March 2013 — both by the government of former President Mohammed Morsi.</p>
<p>Investors in the Egyptian bourse were confused and outraged by the latest tax announcement as much as by the announcement’s disorganized presentation and timing on the day when expectations were focused on the outcome of presidential elections. On June 1, the Egyptian Exchange was still in upheaval and trading was suspended from 11:20 am until 11:45 am. By market close at 2:30 pm the EGX 30 was nonetheless down 4.2 percent for the day.</p>
<p><strong>MSCIng the thrills</strong></p>
<p>Compared with the drama on the Cairo financial scene, the market movements in the rest of North Africa and the Levant could not fascinate. The Moroccan, Tunisian and Jordanian markets each fluctuated by less than 2 percent to the downside, but all three recouped that ground and closed the review period flat when compared with the end of the week prior.</p>
<p>The Beirut Stock Exchange, however, ended a period of small index movements with a 20 points gain on May 29–30, which looked to be the biggest two-day rise in the BLOM Index since mid-January. According to the BSE Bulletin, Bank Audi and Solidere were the key gainers on each of the two days. Daily gains ranged from 1.3 percent to 2.2 percent for the two share classes of the real estate company. Bank Audi GDRs rose 3.1 percent on May 29 and the bank’s common shares advanced 3.8 percent the following day.</p>
<p>Massive trading volumes drove the markets in Qatar and the United Arab Emirates on May’s last trading day as the much discussed MSCI Emerging Markets index’s inclusion of 19 stocks from across the three markets triggered share buying by international funds. This drove the ADX General Index 6.6 percent higher on the week, followed by gains of 5.3 percent in Qatar and 4.6 percent in Dubai. The QE Index’s rise brought it to a new all-time high.</p>
<p><strong>Passive activity</strong></p>
<p>Index tracking or ‘passive’ funds hold stock portfolios whose composition mirrors that of an index. When compared with active funds, whose managers pick stocks based on a fund’s respective criteria and buy and sell shares according to their own research, passive funds offer investors much lower operating costs.</p>
<p>One can think of passive funds as financial markets’ equivalent of Carrefour and Walmart, while active funds are akin to Neiman Marcus or Harrods. Active funds will dote on investors with a taste for tailored products in exchange for a hefty fee, but in terms of value for cost, the passive funds occasionally deliver more.</p>
<p>As May 29 was the first day for passive funds to compulsively adjust their portfolios in accordance with the revised MSCI EM index composition, their demand pushed share prices for 12 out of the 19 index entrants from the UAE and Qatar up by more than five percent each. However, the market dynamics also saw stocks go up which were not part of the MSCI selection.</p>
<p>In Abu Dhabi, eleven companies rose by between five percent and the daily limit of 15 percent on Thursday, of which four were driven higher by the MSCI EM siren song. These four were National Bank of Abu Dhabi, Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank, First Gulf Bank and Aldar. NBAD, which experienced extreme demand when compared with its average trading volumes, and ADCB rose at the upper limit; Aldar and FGB respectively gained 7.3 percent and 5.6 percent. The seven other ADX gainers of more than 5 percent included one bank, one insurer, two agricultural firms, a construction materials company, a services company and the cross-listed Qatari telco Ooredoo, which is an entrant to the EM index.</p>
<p>On the Qatar Exchange, however, Ooredoo was only a small gainer on Thursday, moving up just 0.6 percent. In Doha, the companies with share price gains of more than 5 percent each included MSCI EM entrants Vodafone, Barwa, Al Rayan Bank and Qatar Islamic Bank. Of the six other Qatari entrants, including Ooredoo, three saw their share prices go up while three dropped. Elsewhere on the QE, the Qatar National Cement Company’s 6.4 percent gain made it the one strong riser that was not part of the MSCI selection.</p>
<p>On the Dubai Financial Market, some of the EM debutants showed strong gains, as did several others. Emaar Properties and Arabtec pushed 7.2 and 6.3 percent higher while Dubai Islamic Bank added 6.2 percent. The one stock in Dubai to climb at the daily limit was the stock market operator, DFMCO. Outside of the debutant group, Ajman Bank gained 7.1 percent, Dubai Investment Co 5.8 percent and Shuaa Capital 9.6 percent.</p>
<p>Gulf media cited both analysts and research into behavior of reclassified markets to caution that the passive funds — in comparison to active funds’ far smaller assets under management — must not be expected to inject further massive amounts into the UAE and Qatari markets and that post-upgrade, further gains in the markets should not be speculated on.</p>
<p>Of the four other GCC markets, Oman’s MSM 30 was the strongest gainer with 1.7 percent, followed by Tadawul with 0.7 percent. The Bahraini bourse index was flat and the KSE Index gave up 0.8 percent in a trading week that was cut one day short.</p>

He was driven to the emergency department of the American University Hospital in Beirut, only to find the entrance blocked by a big black SUV. The hospital security guard shrugged. It was a minister&#x2019;s car. He was, my friend said, unable to grasp the notion, that public servants were not only above the law but should set a higher standard of conduct.</p><p> I heard this after having spent a few days in England, where the leader of the Labour opposition, Ed Miliband, was ridiculed for the way he ate a sandwich. I wondered what plague and pestilence would be visited upon a British cabinet minister who deliberately blocked a hospital emergency.</p><p> And yet we Lebanese just suck it up. We tolerate the fact that not only has the economy been mismanaged to the point of abandonment for nigh on three years, but that we grin and bear the extra burden placed on productivity and morale by the fatuous antics and terrible policies of our political class.</p><p> The public sector, a hotbed of sinecure and waste at the best of times, is demanding a pay rise with regular strikes and demonstrations that burden our daily lives. Parliament knows the money just isn&#x2019;t there (and that it would set a dangerous precedent for the private sector), but when so much political loyalty is based on patronage, especially within the ranks of Hizbollah and the Amal Movement, the result is deadlock. Enter the IMF, which declared that the issue &#x201c;has diverted attention away from the need for broader fiscal consolidation&#x201d;. You think?</p><p>Elsewhere, there are rumblings from the tens of thousands of protected tenants who for decades have been paying &#x201c;old rent&#x201d;&#x2013; rates set before the civil war when 5 Lebanese pounds, rather than today&#x2019;s 1,500 pounds (Dh3.6), bought US$1. Understandably, landlords want them out, but even with relatively generous compensation they would be unable to find similar housing.</p><p> On so many levels, the chickens are coming come home to roost. OK, the Central Bank still has $33.6 billion worth of gross foreign currency reserves and is sitting on 286.8 tonnes of gold, but let us not forget that Lebanon had the second and third-fastest growing Arab economies in 2009 and 2010. By 2012, it had the slowest and we haven&#x2019;t looked back. In that time, GDP has plummeted from 9 per cent in 2009-10 to 1 per cent today. Not only have we been unable to sufficiently insulate ourselves from the Syrian civil war, our political class deliberately took sides and to hell with the consequences.</p><p> As the economy ran out of steam, the public was served up a spectacular and well-timed, red herring: Lebanon was on track to generate billions of dollars from our plentiful natural oil and gas reserves. We would, we were told, be the Norway of the Middle East.</p><p> The former energy minister, Gebran Bassil, of the whiter than white Free Patriotic Movement, even had the audacity to publish an illustrated brochure in which a father, with an uncanny likeness to himself, shows his son a future in a Lebanon all green and clean and modern, no doubt as a result of how the FPM skilfully, benevolently and transparently husbanded our natural assets.</p><p> Of course it was all smoke and mirrors. There are still no guarantees we have any exploitable reserves as no exploration licenses have been issued; there is still an irritating boundary dispute with Israel and the story seems to have fallen off the front pages as oil companies remain in a holding pattern to see if it is worth doing business in a system that will never fast-track anything unless all political parties can wet their beaks.</p><p> So we&#x2019;re back to 1 per cent GDP and facing an economic and social crisis with a political class that has become even more of a hindrance.</p><p> It&#x2019;s enough to give you a heart attack.</p><p> </p><p>Michael Karam is a freelance writer based in Beirut</p>";s:17:"post_image_height";i:0;s:16:"post_image_width";i:0;s:11:"post_visits";i:6;s:18:"post_twitterShares";i:0;s:19:"post_facebookShares";i:19;s:16:"post_totalShares";i:19;s:16:"post_socialScore";i:18;s:13:"post_virality";i:24;s:9:"blog_name";N;s:16:"blog_description";N;s:8:"blog_url";N;s:11:"blog_author";N;s:28:"blog_author_twitter_username";N;s:13:"blog_rss_feed";N;s:9:"blog_tags";N;s:2:"id";N;s:11:"blog_active";N;s:24:"blog_last_post_timestamp";N;s:6:"col_id";i:6;s:8:"col_name";s:29:"Michael Karam at The National";s:16:"col_media_source";s:12:"The National";s:13:"col_home_page";s:109:"http://www.thenational.ae/apps/pbcs.dll/search?q=*&NavigatorFilter=[Byline:Michael%20Karam]&BuildNavigators=1";s:13:"col_shorthand";s:8:"mkaramtn";s:26:"col_media_source_shorthand";s:12:"the_national";s:27:"col_author_twitter_username";s:15:"Lebanesewineman";s:8:"col_tags";s:20:"columnists, politics";s:15:"col_description";s:40:"Michael Karam is a writer and journalist";s:23:"col_last_post_timestamp";i:1404727872;}i:10;O:8:"stdClass":36:{s:7:"post_id";i:30732;s:8:"post_url";s:75:"http://www.executive-magazine.com/business-finance/finance/ambassadors-citi";s:10:"post_title";s:19:"Ambassadors of Citi";s:10:"post_image";s:92:"http://www.executive-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Citi-feature-foreign-banks_.jpg";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:123:"International banks have been leaving the Lebanese market or selling off some of their operations.

Last year, <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/09/01/us-hsbc-mideast-idUSBRE98005D20130901" target="_blank">HSBC reported</a> that they were to discontinue any sale of their investment and wealth management products in Lebanon as part of their global strategy to exit their less profitable branches. Similarly, the recent bidding process between local banks over who will acquire Standard Chartered’s retail banking operations is nearing completion, according to a source close to Standard Chartered. Most recently, <a href="http://www.dailystar.com.lb/Business/Lebanon/2014/May-14/256339-fransabank-to-acquire-local-ahli-interests.ashx#axzz33SyUk6al" target="_blank">reports emerged</a> that Lebanese franchise of Jordanian-owned Ahli International will be acquired by the Lebanese Fransabank.</p>

<p>Lebanon has witnessed many waves of international banks exiting the market since its pre-civil war glory days where it enjoyed the status of being the banking hub of the Middle East. Many banks left during the civil war only to be re-established after it ended. But recent cases of banks exiting or divesting from Lebanon raise the question of what would motivate an international bank to maintain a presence in Lebanon.</p>
<p><b>Both local and strategic</b></p>
<p>Despite recent exits, the decision of these international banks to stay or leave the country doesn’t depend entirely on the Lebanese environment for banking. Their overarching corporate strategy is a large determinant in whether or not these continued operations make sense.</p>
<div><a href="http://www.executive-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/CITI_Elissar-Farah-Antonios.jpg"><img src="http://www.executive-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/CITI_Elissar-Farah-Antonios.jpg" alt="Citi's managing director Elissar Farah Antonios" width="1000" height="750"></a><p>Citi’s managing director Elissar Farah Antonios</p></div>
<p>In the case of the Lebanese unit of global financial group Citi, managing director Elissar Farah Antonios explains that having a far-reaching global presence is one of the bank’s top priorities. “This is something that we’re not going to change as a strategy, not only for Lebanon but globally,” she says, claiming that Citigroup’s presence in roughly 160 countries includes some that have much more challenging economies than Lebanon.</p>
<p>Registered locally as Citibank, the group first came to Lebanon in the 1950s, where its Beirut office used to be the hub for the region, explains Farah Antonios. Though they were forced to leave during the civil war, they re-established the branch in 1996.</p>
<p>Farah Antonios describes Citi’s presence in Lebanon as “part of our global footprint.” She adds, “As long as it makes sense for us to be doing business in the country … as long as we can run our business with an acceptable efficiency ratio, we’re going to be here.”</p>
<p>Citi is determined to stay in Lebanon and Farah Antonios sees no reason why they would want to leave any time soon. She claims that the branch has an efficiency ratio of 38 percent, meaning for every dollar made it costs 38 cents. “It does very much justify us being here,” she adds.</p>
<div><p>As few foreign banks are left in Lebanon, they remain one of international companies’ few options to be serviced by a bank with a large global presence</p>
</div>
<p>Citibank’s asset growth affirms the commitment of the parent company of maintaining a branch in Lebanon. Their assets for 2010, 2011 and 2012 grew to $174.1 million, $180.8 million and $207.2 million, respectively, according to Bankdata. This constituted an increase of 3.7 percent between 2010 and 2011 and 12.7 percent between 2011 and 2012. Citibank claims that their assets increased a further 43 percent between 2012 and 2013, but this could not yet be verified by Bankdata.</p>
<p>In 2013, Citigroup made $13.7 billion in profits worldwide, its largest take since the 2007–2008 financial crisis, according to its annual report.</p>
<p>When it comes to Lebanon, Farah Antonios explains that the country represents added value for their institutional client group — international clients who would bank with Citi anywhere in the world. This institutional client group includes financial institutions, large corporations and governments. According to Farah Antonios, Citi’s main activities in Lebanon include acting as a US dollar correspondent, performing transactions abroad on behalf of Lebanese banks and financial institutions, servicing Lebanese businesspeople who do business outside of Lebanon, as well as servicing the public sector — a very active business ever since the Ministry of Finance launched its Eurobonds.</p>
<p>In addition, Farah Antonios explains that the branch plays an important role acting as “ambassadors” of Citi, whereby if a client requests a product or service not available locally, they can outsource it to the bank’s regional headquarters in London. “We’re only 30–40 employees, so we clearly don’t cover all the products that Citi has.”</p>
<p>Though Beirut is no longer Citi’s main hub for the region, they still see it as an important foothold. “We’ve lost some global clients to Dubai, but it still justifies servicing out of Beirut,” says Farah Antonios.</p>
<p>As few foreign banks are left in Lebanon, they remain one of international companies’ few options to be serviced by a bank with a large global presence.</p>

Obama particularly mentioned Syria  as a dangerous new arena where militants were gathering for training, indoctrination and fighting.This reflects irony, confusion and incompetence on the part of the United States, the United Kingdom  and other Western governments because the continued growth of these militant Islamists, especially the most virulent Salafist-takfiris among them, can be traced directly to recent Anglo-American policies in Iraq  and other parts of the Arab world. Obama may defeat these people, but he should recognize them as his country’s own progeny that was, and still is, midwifed by its policies. </p><p>If Obama is really concerned about this, he should convene an honest, dispassionate commission of enquiry into the full consequences of the 2003 war on  Iraq that was energetically led by President George W. Bush  and British Prime Minister Tony Blair. That war, by removing the government and armed forces of the Iraqi state, created a security vacuum in large swaths of the country. This, in turn, provided the most fertile and welcoming environment for  Al-Qaeda militants such as Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, who carried out murderous, sectarian-based warfare against Shiites and fellow Sunnis whom they considered apostates.</p><p>Only when Bush and Blair provided  Al-Qaeda with this golden opportunity to establish a strong base of operations in the heart of the Arab world did the threat from Salafist-takfiris become operationally indigenized in a territorial base under their control. They then spread rapidly to  Syria and other parts of the region.</p><p>The Lebanon-Syria- Iraq area has become a single operating unit for them. Experts who study this phenomenon say that at least 15,000 armed and active fighters operate there today, while some put the figure closer to 30,000.</p><p>The larger dilemma for the Western powers that now see these radicals as their biggest national security threat is that the  Iraq war experience is only one of several measurable ways in which Western policies stoked the birth and growth of these dangerous movements. The initial birth and expansion of  Al-Qaeda occurred earlier, as a response to the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan  and the American military presence in  Iraq and Saudi Arabia following the 1991 war to liberate Iraqi-occupied Kuwait. </p><p> Al-Qaeda has also always capitalized on widespread Arab-Islamic resentment of two other factors that directly involve American policy: support for corrupt, incompetent and often-brutal Arab regimes; and chronic and extreme pro-Israeli policies in the Arab-Israeli conflict. Finally, Obama’s drone-based assassinations across the African-Asian region have created hundreds of fresh recruits for the militants’ cause every week from many countries. </p><p>The Arab states and governments themselves, though, bear the major blame for allowing this situation to prevail, because their own brutality, mismanagement, criminality and abuse of power have pushed their citizens into open rebellion. Popular peaceful or armed revolts have sought to overthrow Arab regimes, and  Al-Qaeda and similar movements, especially nonviolent Salafists, have become one of the fastest growing ideological trends in the region. The direct and sustained role of American, British and other Western states’ foreign policies in creating conditions that have promoted this trend is too obvious to miss.</p><p>Now these countries, like ours, also face this new threat of radicalized religious fanatics who kill and create chaos – because chaos and ungoverned zones are the vital foundational element they require to operate, as has happened in parts of Yemen, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Somalia, Syria, Iraq, Nigeria and Mali. </p><p>An estimated 11,000 foreign fighters in  Syria come from Western and Muslim-majority countries. Western governments have stepped up their efforts to stem this flow, including the United Kingdom, which has stripped at least 20 men of their citizenship and convicted one Islamist who returned home from  Syria of engaging in conduct in preparation of terrorist acts.</p><p>Many of the militants have said that American, British and other Western states’ foreign policies have motivated their desire to respond by attacking targets in those Western countries. One such militant was quoted as saying that “attacks are occurring on the soil of Middle Eastern countries. We can only expect a response. Americans are still in Afghanistan.”</p><p>So yes, Western leaders should be concerned. The best way for them to reduce this threat is to stop engaging in foreign policy actions that have contributed to creating and nurturing such danger in the first place. </p><p>Rami G.

His speech at West Point on Wednesday, portrayed as a major statement on foreign policy, was in fact a whimper sold as a bang.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Six years into an eight-year presidency, Obama essentially restated major foreign policy themes already associated with him. Little new was revealed, and there was no sense that the president sought to correct past errors. His speech was mainly a justification of what he has done until now, a foreign policy counteroffensive amid mounting criticism from some quarters.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But if Obama stuck to his guns, it is undoubtedly because he felt that a majority of Americans agreed with him that their country must be implicated less in resolving overseas problems.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Yet the president also declared, &ldquo;It is absolutely true that in the 21st century, American isolationism is not an option.&rdquo; True, but isolationism is as much a state of mind as anything else. It may not be realistic in an integrated world; however, what is possible, and present today, is an American attitude that invariably tends to stray away from most foreign interventions.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When it is implied that all such interventions are potentially dangerous because they may lead to large military commitments, things becomes stifling. In Syria, for instance, Obama has from the start misrepresented the stakes, implying that if America entered the fray, it could soon find itself in a new Iraq war. The reality is that there always was a menu of options such that, even if the American military was deployed, it could have kept the risk of being caught in a quagmire at a minimum. Establishing no-fly zones was an example.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Most remarkable was Obama&rsquo;s need to mouth the platitudes of American greatness. Because American values inspire people worldwide, the president declared, &ldquo;the United States is and remains the one indispensable nation. That has been true for the century past, and it will be true for the century to come.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It is difficult to identify precisely what values Obama was thinking about. If America can stand idly by while a tyrant slaughters over a hundred thousand of his own citizens; if 60 percent of Americans can oppose any action against Syria after Bashar al-Assad fired chemical weapons at civilians in the Ghouta last summer, even though 75 percent of respondents said they thought Assad&rsquo;s forces had indeed used such weapons; after all this, then American values are really about indifference.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The president&rsquo;s use of the term &ldquo;indispensable nation&rdquo; was equally surprising. Much of Obama&rsquo;s efforts in the past six years have been to underline that the world should not expect America to play a role everywhere while the country focused on rebuilding its economy. Indeed Vali Nasr, who served in Obama&rsquo;s first term, wrote a book very critical of the president&rsquo;s foreign policy titled, you guessed it, &ldquo;The Dispensable Nation.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Obama&rsquo;s comments on Syria came mainly in the context of the president&rsquo;s vow to fight terrorism. Obama did say that the United States must &ldquo;help the Syrian people stand up against a dictator who bombs and starves his own people.&rdquo; But he added, &ldquo;In helping those who fight for the right of all Syrians to choose their own future, we are also pushing back against the growing number of extremists who find safe haven in the chaos.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>America&rsquo;s self-centered obsession with terrorism is understandable, but as David Ignatius, who is often gentle when discussing Obama, bitingly observed: &ldquo;Surely the president recognizes that terrorism has a deadly new face in Syria in part because he turned down a mid-2012 recommendation to train moderate opposition forces to counter the extremists.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>There has been much speculation about what Washington might do to assist &ldquo;moderate&rdquo; Syrian rebels, but, strangely, Obama did not see fit to mention specifics. Perhaps that&rsquo;s because the president did not want to embarrass Jordan, which would doubtless host American efforts in this regard. Or it could be that Obama did not want to offset the general tenor of his speech by outlining what could be a controversial decision to increase America&rsquo;s contribution to Syria&rsquo;s war.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But the reality is that Obama has still not wrapped his mind around Syria, and remains uncertain how an anti-terrorism focus can coexist with a broader effort to alter the environment that allows terrorist groups to gain in strength. Obama faced a similar dilemma in Afghanistan, and reacted in contradictory ways: he initially advanced a counter-insurgency project that included elements of nation-building; he then reversed course to focus on a less ambitious counter-terrorism strategy.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>High policy aside, Obama&rsquo;s primary preoccupation in his West Point speech may have been the congressional elections next November. The president expects to be hammered by the Republicans over his indecisive foreign policy. By clarifying his thinking on the matter, of which many Americans are bound to approve, Obama may have sought to blunt future criticism.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>One can only admire Obama&rsquo;s skill over the past six years in selling his foreign policy snake oil to a largely-sedated American people. But that approval has also frayed somewhat in light of the president&rsquo;s lack of initiative and imagination, so that even the Washington Post&rsquo;s editorial board can write that Obama&rsquo;s foreign policy has &ldquo;been consistent &ndash; consistently bad.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The West Point speech was a perfect illustration. It told us nothing we didn&rsquo;t know, and much we would rather not know.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Michael Young is opinion editor of The Daily Star newspaper.

He is proud to have brought the little Italian restaurant across the Mediterranean to Beirut.</p>
<p>Bou Chaaya, who has a background in hospitality and event planning in Qatar, had always planned to open his own venue in his home city, Beirut. On a business trip to Italy, he visited La Traviata by chance and fell in love with its authenticity, immediately deciding that it should be the restaurant through which he realizes his plan.</p>
<p>After some initial research revealed that La Traviata was ranked number one among Bologna’s 360 restaurants on the travel website Trip Advisor, Bou Chaaya was even more convinced of his choice, and he decided to approach the family with the idea of franchising a branch in Lebanon. The matron, Manuela Sabbatino, was easily swayed.“They were happy that someone was interested in expanding their business [even] before knowing my background and what I could provide them with,” he says.</p>
<p>So began a two year stint in La Traviata’s kitchen where Bou Chaaya — who says his knowledge in the kitchen was lacking — learned all of Sabbatino’s recipes, the way she thinks before cooking and how to choose and find the best ingredients. “I needed to know every aspect of the kitchen so I am not affected if a chef decides to leave,” he says, adding that this is the basis of the restaurant business, especially in Lebanon.</p>
<p>With his training complete, Bou Chaaya entered with the family as a 15 percent shareholder in La Traviata Bologna and vice versa. “This was to ensure good faith, coordination and communication,” explains Bou Chaaya. Even today, the two shareholders start their day with email communications deciding on new recipe ideas or ingredients.</p>
<p>Nestled on a corner of Gemmayze’s Pasteur Street, La Traviata’s investment size was close to $400,000. Bou Chaaya admits that the price tag was steep but says no expense was spared in recreating the spirit of the original venue without falling victim to duplicating it exactly and appearing fake. “I even got the tiles on the bar from Italy,” he says.</p>
<p>With a maximum seating capacity of 55 customers when its exterior and interior are combined, La Traviata is indeed a cozy eatery. The outdoor seating area, on the sidewalk under the venue’s red awnings and next to various plants, is reminiscent of Europe’s chic sidewalk cafes even if a little too exposed to Beirut’s honking cars and traffic.</p>
<p><strong><span>An authentic italian experience</span></strong></p>
<p>Designed by Lebanese architectural company C-Lab, the interior is charming and indeed no detail, from the classical Italian music playing in the background to the choice of dainty yet simple cutlery used, is spared to create an authentic Italian experience for the customer. The walls are adorned with black and white reprints of people eating strings of pasta in different manners — the same reprints are found in Bologna’s La Traviata — and a large wall painting of a family portrait. To the back of the venue is a red window frame around a TV screen depicting the exact view enjoyed by those sitting in Bologna which changes with the weather and passage of time.</p>
<p>But the highlight of La Traviata is the food, which Bou Chaaya, just like Sabbatino, prepares from scratch on a daily basis. Bou Chaaya explains that he does not have any dry pasta or machinery but prepares and cuts the pasta by hand which is why the menu features only tagliatelle, ravioli and tortellini — three kinds of pasta which don’t need to be machine cut.</p>
<p>La Traviata only has service fridges and no storage space, meaning nothing can be kept for the next day. Leftovers are given to the staff at the end of the day. Bou Chaaya sees this as both a blessing, since it means his food is always fresh, and a curse, as it leads to a higher cost.</p>
<p>“I believe it is not how you cook, but what you buy which makes a good dish; a basic recipe with quality ingredients can be amazing,” says Bou Chaaya, who imports all his main ingredients (except for the olive oil) from Italy either directly or through wholesalers for larger quantities.</p>
<p>Though the recipes were quite simple, the freshness and quality of the ingredients could be tasted with every bite. The meal started off with a selection of Italian wine from the wide, yet affordable, list provided and a complimentary platter of granular Reggiano parmesan cheese and mortadella chunks served with bread.</p>
<p>The bacon wrapped mozzarella cheese we ordered for appetizers was an interesting blend of sour from the balsamic dressing and salty from the melting cheese. As for our ravioli and tortellini main courses, which came highly recommended from our friendly and well-informed waiter, they were perfectly al dente. The right amount of cheese was used in the stuffing so as not to hide the pasta’s taste.</p>
<p>We finished off our meal with strong espressos made from coffee beans that Bou Chaaya imports from an Italian family who make their own special blend.</p>
<p>The total bill was $60, making it an affordable place for the quality it offers.</p>
<p><strong><span>Verdi bright future</span></strong></p>
<p>La Traviata currently has an average daily turnover of 65 customers but Bou Chaaya, who has until now relied on word of mouth for promotion, is about to start a social media marketing campaign in an attempt to increase that number. “I wanted it to be the kind of place one discovers alone, but I need to increase the turnover. It’s a business after all,” he says, adding that he hopes to recoup his investment in three years.</p>
<p>Though Bou Chaaya claims to enjoy the competition with other Italian venues in Lebanon, he says all hospitality venues in the country are competing with each other for a very narrow market of people who go out. He is considering expanding the concept to Abu Dhabi, which has lower rents and less competition than Dubai.</p>
<p>As for Lebanon, Bou Chaaya is not done yet. He hopes to one day open a seaside venue outside of Beirut that will appeal to customers in the summer.</p>

He is also the chief financial officer of Audi Group, Odea’s parent. Most importantly, he is the personification of strategy at Lebanon’s largest banking group. Executive asked him what Audi Group has on its mind.   </em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>You have told us that Odeabank has achieved 110 percent expansion in both the number of customers and new accounts in the first quarter of 2014. How did this unexpectedly high growth impact your targets? Can you tell us what</b><b> you are aiming for within 2014 and by the end of 2015?</b></p>
<p>We have a very ambitious business plan. Unfortunately I cannot disclose details because we are listed in London. That means we have legal liabilities and we have developed an ethics [code] to be in full compliance with LSE regulations. So let me put it differently: Our aim is to develop a subsidiary in Turkey which will rank second to [our operation in] Lebanon in the foreseeable future — so not talking long-term — in terms of assets and earnings.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>When do you expect to achieve positive results in the Odeabank income statement?</b></p>
<p>We have reached a stage where in Q1 2014 we have for the first time a balanced monthly P&L [profit and loss statement] before provisioning. In the second step we have to reach a balanced P&L including provisioning and taxes, and then start building the profit base and grow exponentially to achieve our RoE [return on equity] targets.</p>
<div><p>We are the largest contributor to GDP formation; we generate 1.8 percent of Lebanon’s GDP and we are the largest financier to the domestic economy.</p>
</div>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Can you discuss the Odeabank RoE targets for 2015?</b></p>
<p>No. In principle our strategy in all markets where we are present is to achieve a sustainable RoE at a premium [against] the country’s cost of equity in order to create value to our shareholders. We have the same target in Turkey.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>The next stop on the Bank Audi growth tour is to launch in Iraq. What is the group’s target for Iraq?</b></p>
<p>Iraq fits within the same scheme [as our move into Turkey] because 25 percent of trade turnover between Turkey and the Arab world is with Iraq. Our decision to expand quickly into Iraq is within our regional expansion strategy but also to help Odea acquire Turkish companies involved in business with Iraq as clients.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Would it be possible for the group to extend services into Turkish–Iranian trade via Odeabank?</b></p>
<p>We belong to the Arab World and this is why we look at Turkey. We won’t go to a third country [merely] because it has good trade relations with Turkey. But to give you an honest answer, we are developing more and more curiosity toward Iran. But this is not a short-term interest.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Would you be interested in acquiring any bank in the Lebanese market?</b></p>
<p>I am giving you a conceptual answer which has nothing to do with the reality of the bank: We might consider a mega-merger because any combination among the top ten would make a lot of sense in terms of business and financial synergies — but for the time being, this is something that is not supported by the central bank.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Haven’t you attempted to undertake a mega-merger with a top Lebanese bank before? Why would this be something for you to think about, even in the long term? </b></p>
<p>We have tried domestically and regionally, and domestically we tried with almost all of [the other banks]. We believe in synergies and we believe that a mega-merger would provide the country with a lot of advantages by promoting a Lebanese bank into the top five to ten regional banks, something that is not negligible for Lebanon. This would also translate into more involvement domestically, although we are already very happy about our level of involvement. Do you know that we are the largest private sector employer and the largest taxpayer in Lebanon? We are the largest contributor to GDP formation; we generate 1.8 percent of Lebanon’s GDP and we are the largest financier to the domestic economy. We are very proud of our economic and social role in Lebanon, but we still believe that consolidation can provide [advantages].</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Wouldn’t a mega-merger with your involvement create a monopoly power?</b></p>
<p>I don’t look at it as a monopoly. In my opinion you can tolerate a mega-merger by providing restrictions and rules.</p>

The court's contempt judge Nicola Lettieri interrupted Amin during his statement, drawing a rebuke from Amin who has called on the judge to publicly apologize.</p><p>To the Honorable Judge Nicola Lettieri, </p><p>My presence here is not the result of my own free will, but is rather more akin to the execution of an arrest warrant. This is because your court professes, on the one hand, to respect the standards of justice, while neglecting, at the same time, the most basic of procedures that are required for the holding of a fair trial. </p><p>I have previously expressed to you my reservations regarding any rulings that might be issued concerning me by your court, and I reiterate, today, that I do not acknowledge the legitimacy of this tribunal. This is an institution that was created by the United Nations Security Council – the body that has never guaranteed the safety of the World. </p><p>Slightly over a hundred kilometers from here is a land called Palestine, whose people is the only population in the world that remains deprived of the right to self determination. All forms of crimes are committed against the Palestinian people and this “Security Council” never acts; international tribunals are never created in order to prosecute Zionist war criminals. How then can any rational and educated person, who respects Human Rights trust the decisions of the UN Security Council? </p><p>This tribunal's mandate is restricted to a single case of political assassination and was not referred to other existing international tribunals, because this case does not have the required elements to be referred to such international tribunals. However, the Security Council established this tribunal as a political tool.</p><p>I hereby remind you that, recently, and after the first steps to establish such tribunal were taken, Israel committed a massacre resulting in the death of 1,300 Lebanese within 30 days in July 2006. Impunity prevails in this case. Neither the Security Council nor any International legal body held Israel accountable. </p><p>During the past year alone, horrible massacres and crimes against humanity were committed by car bomb attacks targeting Lebanese citizens just because of their sectarian identity, and no one was held accountable. And I note here that the killers and criminals are backed by some Lebanese, regional and international groups that support this tribunal. </p><p>How would you expect us to trust the Security Council and its decisions or its various tribunals?</p><p>This tribunal was established in the dark. It was established against the Lebanese constitutional and legal principles. Even its funding is made secretly without the approval of the concerned authorities.</p><p>Your tribunal was established as part of a political process that started with the formation of international investigative commissions to look into the assassination of former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri. We all know that the local, regional, and international powers that stood behind the establishment of the Special Tribunal are the same ones that are inciting for perpetual wars in my country, against my people, and against my country’s heroic resistance in the face of American, European, and Israeli terrorism. </p><p>My presence here today does not signify, in the slightest of ways, that I acknowledge you as an institution that seeks to accomplish justice. To the contrary, my forced presence here is due to my legitimate concern that members of my family, or colleagues in the newspaper that I manage, may be subject to abusive measures by your court regarding a case to which they have no relation. Such measures would only be in fulfillment of the desires of the forces of oppression, in my country, in the region, and in the World. </p><p>As for me personally, I care little for any of the actions that you have taken, or that you may yet take, for I do not acknowledge you as legitimate, and I view your court’s entire course of action as a flagrant assault against my freedom and the freedom of the press in my country. </p><p>I do not find myself, here, to be in need of a lawyer, or of legal aid of any sort, for I have nothing to say regarding the charges filed against me, the very issuing of which by your court represents a lack of respect for all the international laws guaranteeing human rights and the right to free expression. </p><p>My decision to re-publish material that was already published in the press reflects, precisely, the essence of my professional and ethical commitment toward my people, which was – and remains – subjected to the greatest process of deception under the name of justice and the law. </p><p>All the successive officials that took charge of the dossier of Hariri’s assassination have engaged in evidence-fabrication that may result in the death of innocent people, after having caused the imprisonment of others, in addition to becoming a constant alibi for the massive breach of the privacy of my people. Therefore, I unequivocally reject the accusation filed against me and I view it as void, in form and in substance. </p><p>On a different front, and since I am today representing Al-Akhbar newspaper, it is my duty to bring to your attention the fact that it is the only Arab newspaper not to have any links to any oppressive regime in the entire world. And I hereby challenge anyone to prove the existence of any such relationship. </p><p>Al-Akhbar, which you are attempting to punish, is a forum that stands in the heart of the battle against political, social, and cultural persecution, in Lebanon, and in all corners of the globe. </p><p>It was not a coincidence that one of our own, our colleague Assaf Abu Rahhal, would fall martyr to the bullets of the Israeli army of occupation with nobody among those who support this tribunal, in Lebanon and abroad, lifting a finger to provide him with justice by punishing the murderers. </p><p>It is also not a coincidence that this newspaper, whom you threaten with closure, is still subject to political, judicial, and financial litigation by those who support this tribunal in Lebanon, the region, and globally. The Lebanese camp that supports you is incessantly prosecuting Al-Akhbar in front of the judiciary and the executive organs in Lebanon, while its economic team works to deprive Al-Akhbar from advertisement revenues. </p><p>Al-Akhbar is a newspaper that is banned throughout the Arab World. </p><p>Saudi Arabia blocks Al-Akhbar’s website. </p><p>Qatar is financing the attempts to empty the newspaper of its personnel and employees. </p><p>The Syrian government rejects our criticisms, so they ban the circulation of Al-Akhbar in Syria, while the criminals among the Syrian opposition threaten us with beheading. </p><p>France’s Ambassador in Beirut gloats over Al-Akhbar’s imminent closure, as his colleague in the United Nations publicly accuses our correspondent of not being a journalist, but “a security agent”. Why? Simply because we demand the freeing of the international freedom fighter Georges Abdallah who is being held hostage by the French administration - against the decisions of justice and the logic of the law. </p><p>Al-Akhbar is a newspaper that is viewed as a threat by the American government after we published the “Wikileaks” cables, which revealed the American conspiracies against our peoples, and the US government is currently attempting to prevent us from publishing the documents that divulge its ongoing espionage against hundreds of millions of individuals. </p><p>Al-Akhbar is a newspaper that is described by the government of the Israeli enemy, in its letters to the United Nations, as the mouthpiece of terrorism. </p><p>Mr. Lettieri, </p><p>My personal experience with your Special Tribunal has been extremely bitter. It began with threats launched by the head of the first Investigation Commission, Detlev Mehlis, and then by his successor, Serge Brammertz, to subject me to meaningless interrogations; not to forget the “friend of the court”, Stéphane Bourgon, who oversaw a selective interrogation. And here I stand today, enduring a similar treatment with you as well, after you refused to grant me my most basic right to know the legal basis of your accusation, and the penalties that could be imposed against the institution that I represent. This entire experience increases my fears regarding the realization of justice. </p><p>Based on the above, I have decided to exercise my right to remain silent during the entire proceedings, and I refuse to appoint a lawyer to defend me or the “Akhbar Beirut Company.” I also strongly reject being assigned a lawyer by the tribunal.</p><p>Glory to Freedom.</p><p>Glory to the martyrs of the resistance and to its heroic freedom fighters.</p><p>Ibrahim Al-Amin</p>";s:17:"post_image_height";i:498;s:16:"post_image_width";i:780;s:11:"post_visits";i:5;s:18:"post_twitterShares";i:0;s:19:"post_facebookShares";i:293;s:16:"post_totalShares";i:293;s:16:"post_socialScore";i:28;s:13:"post_virality";i:45;s:9:"blog_name";N;s:16:"blog_description";N;s:8:"blog_url";N;s:11:"blog_author";N;s:28:"blog_author_twitter_username";N;s:13:"blog_rss_feed";N;s:9:"blog_tags";N;s:2:"id";N;s:11:"blog_active";N;s:24:"blog_last_post_timestamp";N;s:6:"col_id";i:5;s:8:"col_name";s:36:"Ibrahim al-Amin at Al-Akhbar English";s:16:"col_media_source";s:17:"Al-Akhbar English";s:13:"col_home_page";s:37:"http://english.al-akhbar.com/node/125";s:13:"col_shorthand";s:8:"iaminakh";s:26:"col_media_source_shorthand";s:9:"al_akhbar";s:27:"col_author_twitter_username";N;s:8:"col_tags";s:20:"columnists, politics";s:15:"col_description";s:51:"Ibrahim al-Amin is the Editor in Chief of Al-Akhbar";s:23:"col_last_post_timestamp";i:1403780933;}i:17;O:8:"stdClass":36:{s:7:"post_id";i:30911;s:8:"post_url";s:79:"http://www.executive-magazine.com/business-finance/finance/cash-back-mind-games";s:10:"post_title";s:10:"Mind games";s:10:"post_image";s:74:"http://www.executive-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/cashback_.jpg";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:123:"It seems like a no brainer at first: Use your bank card for your purchases and you will eventually receive a free iPhone...";s:7:"blog_id";s:21:"nabila-rahhal-execmag";s:14:"post_timestamp";i:1401342900;s:12:"post_content";s:5762:"<img width="640" height="360" src="http://www.executive-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/cashback_-640x360.jpg" alt="Banks playing mind games on consumers"><p>It seems like a no brainer at first: Use your bank card for your purchases and you will eventually receive a free iPhone, a trip to Europe or, perhaps best of all, you will get your hard-earned cash back.</p>
<p>Without studying the fine print, consumers rush to rack up points on their cards, pushing themselves to spend more under the conviction that they are getting back what they spent. However, loyalty programs seem to promise the world, but actually offer considerably less.</p>
<p>What started as airline miles collection in exchange for spending on payment cards rapidly mushroomed into the intricate rewards programs that are offered by the majority of Lebanon’s banks today. “Because all banks have some form of these programs, it becomes almost a defensive action to have them — we can’t afford to not have them,” says Anthony Ussher, e-banking division head at Credit Libanais. Another benefit of reward programs for banks is that they encourage clients to open new accounts while gaining customer loyalty through the perks offered.</p>
<p><strong>Delayed gratification</strong></p>
<p>Rewards offered vary from bank to bank but generally fall into the following broad categories: tangible rewards such as electronics or fashion items, experiential rewards such as travel miles or packages, actual cash automatically added to your account and bank services such as credit card activation or insurance premium payment. According to Ussher, 50 percent of Credit Libanais clients redeem their points for travel; 20 percent opt for bank services and insurance premiums; and the remaining 30 exchange them for gifts.</p>
<div><p>Cash back programs give clients approximately $10 back for each $1,000 they spend, a theoretical 1 percent return.</p>
</div>
<p>Accumulating points for any type of reward requires that clients use their debit, credit or online card extensively as they receive between 1 and 10 points for each dollar spent, depending on the bank and card used, while redeeming them requires a high number of points for a comparatively lesser value reward. Receiving a free iPhone 5S from Bank Audi would require a customer spend more than $210,000 while a ticket to Larnaca would translate into $22,500. Cash back programs give clients approximately $10 back for each $1,000 they spend, a theoretical 1 percent return.</p>
<p>According to Laurence Leigh, professor of marketing at AUB, marketers of reward programs make their rewards more valuable at the highest levels of point accumulation. “If you have 2,500 points you get a miserable reward, but if you get 50,000, the value goes up exponentially — if you get 500,000 you get a trip around the world let’s say. So, many people hold off redeeming their points in hopes of that big gift and end up not using them,” says Leigh. Given that points have an average expiration date of three years, people aspire for the big rewards but end up with smaller ones.</p>
<p><strong>Scheming for loyalty </strong></p>
<p>Credit Libanais’ Ussher says that since the bank makes little money off each payment card transaction, it cannot afford to value its rewards any lower and often relies on their subsidiaries, such as insurance companies or travel agencies, to be able to offer the rewards.</p>
<p>Keeping in mind that consumers are essentially getting back very little in comparison to what they spend, it is a wonder that banks say these programs bring them added business.</p>
<div><p>Rewards schemes will compete and adapt in order to keep customer interest high. </p>
</div>
<p>“Any loyalty scheme is designed in such a way that encourages you to consistently use one particular card. This is playing on consumer psychology where people like the idea that they are getting something for nothing: a gift they will value sometime in the future,” says Leigh, explaining that this falls under the branch of behavioral economics where people don’t necessarily act in the way that a rational economic person should and instead do things which are difficult to fit into the standard microeconomic model. They feel happy with the thought of receiving a gift and forget its actual worth compared to what they spent.</p>
<p>Leigh suggests an alternative to payment card usage when it comes to large purchases: “What would be a more rational thing to do would be to ask the vendor if he would give you a discount for using cash instead of plastic. The cash discount you would get this way would almost certainly be more valuable than the reward.”</p>
<p>Yet consumers still dream of the big free gift, and loyalty programs are here to stay. Rewards schemes will compete and adapt in order to keep customer interest high. Ussher suggests the way forward for loyalty programs is for banks to coordinate with merchants who have greater margins for advertising. With both of them working together, banks can offer consumers double points on certain occasions or merchants can offer them discounted items during low seasons.</p>
<p>Another idea that Credit Libanais is considering is to have instant small rewards — such as a free ice-cream — through the point-of-sale receipts, which again plays on consumer behavior, encouraging them to use their cards more.</p>
<p>“A lot of it is psychology but psychology works and keeps people loyal,” says Leigh.</p>

It goes by the name of Odeabank. Odea is apparently not a Turkish word but a brand name chosen because using the family name-based Audi brand would have collided with the four-ringed German car maker’s rights. But look how the kid has grown.</p>
<p>Assets of $8.8 billion, customer deposits of $7 billion and loans of $6 billion were the cornerstone figures for Odeabank at the end of March 2014. That compares to a practically blank slate for a balance sheet with assets of $300 million in the form of the bank’s capital when management threw open the doors of the first branch in November 2012.</p>
<p>This growth was far beyond anything that Audi had anticipated, says Freddie Baz, the chief financial officer and strategy director of Bank Audi. “If you had asked me in mid-2012, ‘What are your prospects for asset growth two years down the road?’ I would never have told you $8 billion because I couldn’t have imagined that we could achieve this figure,” Baz tells Executive.</p>
<div><p>The growth was far beyond anything that Audi had anticipated</p>
</div>
<p>Similarly, Odeabank General Manager Hüseyin Özkaya was cited by media reports from early 2013 [The Banker Magazine Feb 2013] as saying that the bank was aiming to become one of Turkey’s top 15 banks by 2017. But a year later, this growth target was no longer valid because the bank’s balance sheet at end 2013 already put it into 14th rank among the country’s 49 banks.</p>
<p>While Baz declines to publicly cite the number of Odeabank account and card holders at end of the first quarter 2014, he puts the growth of the customer base as 110 percent in just this quarter, and not from a low base but a solid five-digit number of account holders that the bank had accumulated as its customer base by end of last year. Similarly, the number of issued cards had almost doubled in the first quarter of this year versus the number at year-end 2013.</p>
<p>These growth metrics are more important in demonstrating the new bank’s future earnings potential than the figures for assets and deposits, Baz says. “Your franchise at the end of the day is the number of customers you have, the number of accounts you have, [and] the number of credit cards you are issuing. We are on the right track to build a solid franchise, a stable franchise [and] a growing franchise. The rest will come.”</p>
<p><strong><span>Successful rollout</span></strong></p>
<p>The first-year expansion experience of Odeabank is based on Audi Group investing $1.1 billion into the unit. This entailed the rollout of a branch network of 37 outlets, the implementation of high-grade systems and usage of a substantial war chest to acquire top hires from the Turkish banking sector.</p>
<p>Odeabank’s growth also deserves to be seen in context of its national economic and banking environment. According to Turkey’s Banking Regulation and Supervision Agency (Bankacılık Düzenleme Ve Denetleme Kurulu or BDDK) unconfirmed total banking sector assets grew 31.2 percent between January 2013 and 2014 to TRY 1.79 trillion ($861.8 billion). The sector’s one-year growth rates for deposits and loans were equally impressive, at 24.8 percent and 34.8 percent.</p>
<p>The expansion of Odeabank’s assets, deposits and loans in 2013 were multiples of sector growth rates but, starting from a low position at the end of 2012, looks a bit less extravagant when put in perspective of the overall expansionary banking sector data.</p>
<p>A second factor for consideration is Turkey’s economic profile. The World Bank says Turkey’s GDP reached $789.3 billion in 2012 on its country data page. Per capita gross national income of $10,830 in 2012 is not too far ahead of Lebanon’s $9,190 but the Turkish figure correlates with a population size of an estimated 74 million to constitute an economy that is marked by huge potential and the ambition to become one of the world’s ten largest economies by 2023.</p>
<p>This market size alone is worth an expansion effort for a Lebanese banking group with strong financial and development capabilities. Lebanese equity analyst Nadim Kabbara, who covers Bank Audi under his remit as head of research for FFA Private Bank, says that in hypothetical terms, the 20-times larger Turkish GDP when compared with Lebanon would give Bank Audi a loan portfolio representing “perhaps one fifth of Bank Audi’s balance sheet right there,” if the group captures just 1 percent of an assumed $600 to $700 billion loan market in an $800 billion economy with high loans-to-deposits ratios.</p>
<p>But assumptions are assumptions and then reality offers challenges. The Turkish growth story of the past decade began to stutter quite heftily in 2013, and the Turkish lira had a really bad time. Critics of the Turkish success scenario say that credit and property bubbles have been building up and predict busts of these bubbles and rising rates of defaults in the economy.</p>
<p>According to an April 2014 Economic Outlook by the Turkish Ministry of Economy, the World Bank’s GDP growth forecasts for the country are 2.4 and 3.5 percent, respectively, for 2014 and 2015. However, the Turkish government aims at 4 percent GDP growth this year and 5 percent next year and also seeks to improve the ratio of current account balance to GDP from -7.9 percent in 2013 to -5.9 percent in 2015.</p>
<p>Even if Ankara will be able to manage the disruptions of the country’s political stability and perhaps deflect accusations of corruption as propaganda, Turkey’s economic agenda appears to require a lot of structural adjustments. The World Bank said last month that Turkey needs to increase its market share in global trade if it wants to reach long-term export targets. Key to such improvements would be “a policy agenda that is centered on upgrading Turkey’s physical, human and institutional capital.”</p>
<p><strong>Entry strategy</strong></p>
<p>But this World Bank advice on Turkey’s trade growth strategy might actually be water on the mills of Audi Group, because of its original motivation for entering the Turkish market. In talking Executive through the short history of Odea, Baz emphasizes that the project to establish Bank Audi’s presence in Turkey was not initiated in response to the market turmoils that the two group units experienced in Egypt and Syria starting with the Arab Spring and anti-government protests in 2011 and 2012.</p>
<p>“There is a misunderstanding that Audi went to Turkey to mitigate the rising challenges in the Arab World,” Baz says. “[The decision] was within our regional expansion strategy which aimed at a strategic footprint with respect to the exponentially growing trade, financial and human flows between Turkey and the Arab world that we witnessed at that time. You cannot be a regional player without having a footprint in Turkey and the decision was taken before the first quarter in 2011.”</p>
<div><p>“There is a misunderstanding that Audi went to Turkey to mitigate the rising challenges in the Arab World” </p>
</div>
<p><span>The basic calculation was to conquer a share of growing trade finance business between Turkey and the Arab world, which according to Baz reached $50 billion annually in 2013. “Initially from our standpoint as shareholders, our case was built on very solid assumptions of basic economic synergies between Turkey and the Arab world. If we can get 10 percent market share of Arab-Turkish trade-related business, [this means] $50 million in yearly commissions and if we can go up to 15 percent, it is $75 million,” he says.</span></p>
<p>As such, Odeabank was a child of reason, not emotion; its conception was carefully planned and benefited from an unexpected opportunity, namely the fact that top BDDK officials encouraged Audi Group in 2010 to apply for a new Turkish banking license. This was unexpected by Audi strategists because no new licenses had been granted in Turkey since the days when the country plunged into a series of economic and currency stress phases between 1996 and 2001.</p>
<p>When the group started its search for an entry point into the Turkish market in the mid 2000s, it concentrated its efforts on an entry by acquisition but aborted negotiations with several banks due to the high premiums demanded by prospective sellers.</p>
<p>The opportunity to install a subsidiary from scratch was more than a viable alternative to buying an existing franchise ­— it was far superior because of cost advantages. According to Baz, once the smooth one-year process for application review and license issuance was completed, the next part of the story entailed “no mysteries, no miracles, just strong underlying realities. The main difference between acquiring and getting a license is that when you succeed in getting a license, you are spared the goodwill that you normally pay when you acquire. This goodwill in Turkey easily corresponds to 50 percent of the capital of the acquired institution.”</p>
<p>In other words, Baz views the cost differential between the group’s $1.1 billion investment into Odeabank and the price which Bank Audi would have had to pay for an acquisition of a comparable bank as $500 million — money which can be spent better than handing it over to a seller.</p>
<p><strong><span>Local talent</span></strong></p>
<p>According to Baz, this meant that Audi Group could focus on people. “When you can start a business in a new market without incurring any goodwill expense, this provides you with great flexibility in buying talent and allows you to be very competitive in buying the best people in the market.”</p>
<p>The management profiles in Odeabank’s annual report show that the bank’s general manager, Hüseyin Özkaya, has behind him a career of more than 20 years in Turkish banking, mostly with units of HSBC, and was the global bank’s country manager in Russia between 2010 and 2012. He is working with a team of nine assistant general managers who all have backgrounds in high-profile banks, both domestically owned and Turkish units of internationals such as HSBC, ING and BNP Paribas.</p>

</div>
<p>In FFA Bank’s Kabbara’s view, “Bank Audi did the right thing in who they hired in Turkey and in their strategic focus. Comparing with some banks from the Gulf which paid premiums to enter the Turkish markets via acquisitions and who perhaps moved people in who were not cognizant of all risks and circumstances, Audi did some things differently as they built Odeabank from scratch and hired [local] talent — targeting senior management who would bring in their teams.”</p>
<p>In light of the advantage of being a “greenfield” bank, Baz says that the negative bottom line of the first two years of operation, which incurs in both a startup and an acquisition scenario, amounts to $44 million for Odeabank, “well below whatever goodwill we would have paid to acquire an existing bank of the same size.”</p>
<p>He also is not overly worried about the economic challenges that Turkey has started to face in 2013, including the impact that the depreciation of the Turkish lira had on Bank Audi’s financial results. According to him, the size of the negative currency valuation impact moved down from $90 million at the most dire exchange rate to about $50 million at the time of his interview with Executive in May.</p>
<p>The uncertainty over the development of the Turkish economy is not affecting the group’s positive medium-term view on the market, he adds, “but we aim to avoid shocks and pains in the short term.” This, he concedes, “is frustrating for our management there who believe that despite the current environment they can achieve much higher growth.”</p>
<p>When compared with the concerns over the short-term economic outlook, the bigger change in the group’s approach to the Turkish market originated in the hunger of Odeabank’s management team to build a domestic franchise. Bringing their existing relationships with corporate and commercial clients with them, the managers attracted domestic account holders and loan clients, says Baz. “We are building a Turkish franchise thanks to the team there. However, our managers there also like the idea for Audi to become the best Middle Eastern bank in Turkey; so they also want to develop a franchise covering either Middle Eastern corporations established in Turkey or Turkish corporations engaged in business with the Arab world.”</p>
<p>While Odeabank added marketing bells with direct banking services and branding whistles through sponsorship of the women’s basketball team of Istanbul sports club Galatasaray, Baz says that the main focal areas of the bank will be in serving the corporate and commercial segments of the market: “Our ultimate aim is not mass retail. In 80 percent of our network [development] we are driven mainly by business sensitive to our brand.”</p>
<p>For the further growth of Bank Audi into an even bigger regional bank, the group aims to employ a new team of Turkish bankers at its head office in Beirut. “We have an aim to recruit a group of Turkish bankers, mainly corporate and commercial bankers, who will be domiciliated in Lebanon under a group dimension,” says Baz.</p>
<p>Visibility is a key objective for Odeabank and on the day of our interview, the bank’s name certainly received another boost. The Galatasaray Odeabank women’s basketball team won the Turkish League Championship after a 13-year wait and the International Basketball Federation congratulated them on the “most productive season in their history,” which also included the first-ever win of the EuroLeague Women’s title by a Turkish team.</p>
<p>Can any banking performance beat that?</p>

Security Council plus Germany, there has not been much discussion in the West of the expansion of Iranian influence in the Middle East. </p><p>While Arab states, particularly in the Gulf, have expressed anxiety with Iran’s growing power in the region, little has been said about the limits of Iranian ambition and the strong counterreactions it has provoked and will continue to provoke.</p><p> Iran has a finger in several Arab pies. Tehran’s influence over Iraq  and its government is said to be significant. In Lebanon, the ties with Hezbollah have given it a major role in deciding the fate of the country. In the Palestinian-Israeli conflict,  Iran has re-established ties with a financially strapped Hamas. And in Syria, Tehran  has greatly expanded its authority, having played an essential part in bolstering Bashar Assad’s regime. </p><p>However, just leaving matters there means ignoring the tremendous contentiousness and complexity of any Iranian project for regional hegemony. </p><p>The primary medium through which  Iran has extended its influence is Arab Shiite communities. The most obvious problem here is that in no Arab country do Shiites rule on their own. Everywhere, even where Shiites form a majority, they must coexist with sizable Sunni minorities, and the perception of an Iranian threat has usually meant that these Sunnis are, or quickly can become, mobilized against Shiite power plays. </p><p>A second problem is geographical. The continuity of territory between  Iran and the Levant (or  Iran and Yemen), which can allow  Iran to arm and assist Shiite communities there, is never uncontested. This has created a vulnerability in the Iranian position, pushing the Islamic Republic to frequently resort to Shiite communal solidarity, which itself has hardened sectarian fault lines and redoubled the obstacles  Iran faces. </p><p>In Iraq, the Shiite-centered policies of Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki have only generated discontent among Sunnis and Kurds. The Iraqi government is facing a full-fledged revolt in Anbar, a consequence of its mismanagement of relations with the Sunni tribes that had spearheaded the Sahwa, or Awakening, movement. Jihadist groups have sought to take advantage of the ensuing sectarian tensions. </p><p>As for the Kurds, earlier this week Massoud Barzani, the president of the Iraqi Kurdistan region, threatened to take Kurdistan out of  Iraq if Maliki was appointed to a third term as head of government. There are many specific disputes between the Kurds and the government, but Barzani has been particularly critical of Maliki’s methods of governance in the past. </p><p>As they survey this state of affairs, are the Iranians happy? There is a view that as  Tehran cannot control Arab countries directly because of their sectarian makeup, it is left with playing on their divisions. An astute observer has suggested that  Iran benefits from “creative chaos” (a term once directed against American neoconservatives) in the Arab world. Unable to impose a classical model of hegemony in the region, it is destined to look for openings in its chronic disorder.</p><p>To a large extent that conclusion is true. But  Iran is also a country of institutions, where the impulse is to create permanence. Its strategy in Lebanon, which involved anchoring Hezbollah in Lebanon’s Shiite community, is a prime example of this and a particularly successful one.</p><p>In contrast, when it comes to Syria, Tehran’s most important battlefront today, the Iranians have kept Assad’s regime in place. But they have done so by effectively pushing a policy that partitions Syria, with their focus on consolidating Assad’s control over Damascus, the coast, the border with Lebanon  and all regions in between. Outside that vital area, the Iranians seem little concerned with what happens. Nor have they presented a proposal for a political settlement of the conflict, one that can reunify the country.</p><p>All this leads to a more nuanced interpretation of Iranian power, one that involves two sets of contradictory objectives: In some countries where it sees the possibility of controlling the commanding heights of decision-making, the Islamic Republic will perpetuate dynamics of unity.  Lebanon is a good example. </p><p>However, in countries where political, sectarian and ethnic divisions make this impossible,  Iran will exacerbate fragmentation. In that way, it can control chunks of a country, usually the center, while enhancing the marginalization and debilitation of areas not under its authority.  Iraq and Syria  are good illustrations of this version of creative chaos.</p><p>Whether the Iranian approach has been an effective one is a different question altogether. Certainly, it has given  Tehran considerable latitude to be a regional player and obstruct outcomes that might harm its interests. But there is also fundamental instability in a strategy based on exploiting conflict and volatility, denying  Iran the permanence it has historically achieved through its creation of lasting institutions. </p><p>Ironically, the United States may help  Iran in this regard. If a nuclear deal is reached this year, it could prompt the Obama administration to engage  Iran in the resolution of regional issues. This recognition of Iranian power will reinforce those in  Tehran who seek a greater say in the Arab world. But if what we have seen until now is anything to go by, it may not necessarily lead to a more settled Middle East.</p><p>Michael Young is opinion editor of THE DAILY STAR.
