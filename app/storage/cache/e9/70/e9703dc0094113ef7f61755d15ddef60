You don’t want to be there, your parents don’t want to be there, the waiters don’t want to be there – it’s just another soul-crushing Lebanese ritual. Having been to as few of these lunches as I could possibly manage, I noticed that the characters are repetitive. These are seven of the most recurring ones you'll see.
  
  1. The Botox Queen</b>

  Is she happy to see you? Sad? Confused? Wait, is she having a stroke, or is that just her botched eyebrow? We’ll never know.  
  
  2. The Moody Prepubescent Teen </b>

  Good luck getting him or her to take their earphones out. They'll just stroke their weird mushroom haircut and complain about the fact that they have to be there. 
  
  3. The Drunken Oldie</b>

  He will most probably make unsolicited penis jokes to the sad waiter; everyone at the table will die a little inside. 
  
  4. The Budding Socialite</b>

  This woman has multiple orgasms when Aїshti has a sale. She gets featured in every edition of Mondanite magazine, where she gets her picture taken for doing nothing all day but attending lunches at which she doesn’t eat. She also doubles as the “passive mom” who is completely oblivious to the fact that her child just bit someone’s ankle. 
  
  5. The Sticky Child</b>

  Usually accompanied by his Nintendo DS and a personal housekeeper to watch over his demonic behavior, this spawn of Satan will be found crawling underneath the table while his parents ignore him.
  
  6. The Inappropriate Distant Relative</b> 
  
  (Image via The Innovative Educator)
  
  He is somehow married to one of your parents’ second cousins and always manages to tell you how much you’ve “grown” in the most disgusting way possible. With full on eye contact. 
  
  7. The Overbearing Aunt</b>

  Are you married yet? Are you engaged? Do you have a boyfriend? Can she pimp you out?

<p><strong>Those worthless people of Gaza.</strong> How many have died since Tuesday? It doesn’t even matter but I’ll list the number anyway: 154, and those 154 people don’t matter. Some will chant praises to their martyrdom and others will lament how their lives were lost, but they are but a number in a conflict that won’t end, a number to be buried deep in the Arab subconscious between seasons of Arab Idol, Ahla Sot and Elissa’s albums. Gaza was still an open air prison a few years ago and it will remain an open air prison a few years from now. It’s just only remembered at specific instants when their going gets slightly tougher. We get infuriated at the hypocrisy that Israel killing Arabs includes when its entire existence can be taken back, in one way or another, to Western guilt over the Jewish holocaust. But when you come to think of it, are Arabs even entitled to be sad for the people of Gaza who are dying, whose homes are being demolished just so muscles can be flexed and whose deaths are being ridiculed on certain TV channels just because they don’t fit with the rhetoric of the axis currently ruling the world? How are the people of Gaza dying exactly? Is it Israeli planes? Or is it the Arab oil fueling those planes? Or is it the Arab silent towards Israeli plans? Or is it those Arabs making sure their borders with Gaza stay closed, securing that open air prison until who knows when? Or is it the Arab slumber that only finds mild wakefulness sporadically, in Twitter or Facebook hashtags, never trying to speak out against their own regimes, in bed with those killing the people of Gaza, because they are providing them with the biggest mall on Earth and a great shopping experience to boot?</p>
<p><strong>Those worthless people of Syria.</strong> How many Syrians have died in the past 3 or so years? How many digits has that number reached by now? As is the case with Gaza, this too doesn’t even matter, but I’ll list it anyway: 170,000. That six digit figure comprises entire families, men, women, children who will never have the future that a few years back was rightfully theirs. The biggest injustice, however, towards those Syrians isn’t just that their death, in the grand scheme of things, might not actually matter, but the fact that their deaths are also not an absolute truth among the Arabs infuriated by Israel’s actions. How many of those crying over Gaza now actually cared as the toll in Syria rose from one digit to the next? How many of those crying wolf over ABC, BBC, CNN or MTV Lebanon actually watch TV stations that do the exact same thing to those people of Syria? Those six digit lives are nothing more than a bargaining chip in a conflict that is greater than they’ll ever be individually. Those lives don’t fit with their grand political scheme of choice and are a mere tool in the attempt to stop the big bad Sunni monster.</p>
<p><strong>Those worthless people of Lebanon.</strong> There’s no estimate of those that died between 1975 and 2014. Our parents had hoped way back when they decided to stay in this country that things would get better for us, with all the lives lost to fight for causes that they believed in. But things are still the same. Young men and women fought for causes and died only to have the people they fought for forget them the moment a glimpse of power flashed in front of their eyes. And things are still the same today. From one explosion to the next, from burned flesh on Beirut’s asphalt to spoiled breakfasts in Tripoli, to acts defending the country against armies now killing innocents in Gaza, the lives of our countrymen being lost are also simple digits that will keep on adding up until who knows when because we never learn.</p>
<p>The causes are not similar, and the conflicts are not the same. But the people involved are dying with one thing in common: their deaths only serve to escalate numbers without changing anything. How many had to die in Gaza before the collective Arab consciousness decided to budge, before the Arab league figured it should convene or before Egypt figured it should come up with a ceasefire plan with their BFFs? How many more have to die until it is realized that the current status quo regarding the region’s countries and regarding the attitude towards Israel does not simply work? When will Arabs learn that building the world’s tallest structure, biggest artificial island and hosting the World Cup aren’t what really matter when their own people are being slaughtered like sheep right on their doorstep as they sit around and eat their fancy iftars on this bloody Ramadan?</p>
<p>I am a 24 year old Lebanese who lives in a country of violence in a sea of even more violence, and I do not know how to be violent. I do not believe violence is the key to any solution for this region, but I am one of very few voices in a culture that sings weapons in song, brands them on flags and salutes the world with them as they chant takbirs for everyone to hear, a culture that, for instance, doesn’t really want to see Palestine free as much as go to heaven as martyrs for that purpose.</p>
<p>There are a lot of things that we are not allowed to do towards those countries. We can’t do like that Norwegian doctor and visit Gaza to help in whatever way we can. Protesting the regimes of the countries filling this region has also become a dangerous matter even though those tyrant regimes do much worse to their own people than possibly even Israel, regardless of whether such a notion is even entertained by people of the region or not. The only thing we are left with is our voices and platforms to express those voices and try to change perspectives, but does the region even have a clear plan towards using modern day media in order to fight the Israeli rampage? Is there a way for us to get a clear message across when we can’t even agree on what that message should be? Are we not also losing the war of information and misinformation that, in this day and age, has become as tactically important as rockets and blasts and tanks especially with the looming threat of treason over our heads when the message we need to get across is  to those whose existence we are not allowed to acknowledge? Is there a way for us to make the lives lost in the countries of the region slightly less worthless than they are as we remain completely and irrevocably lost, unable to do anything about it but be angry about biased media reporting, portrayals of the people dying as terrorists and the blindness of a world that never really had sight to begin with?</p>
<p>May all those people’s pieces rest in peace.</p><br>Filed under: <a href="http://stateofmind13.com/category/politics-2/">Politics</a>, <a href="http://stateofmind13.com/category/life-2/thoughts/">Thoughts</a>  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/stateofmind13.wordpress.com/11230/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/stateofmind13.wordpress.com/11230/"></a> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/godelicious/stateofmind13.wordpress.com/11230/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/delicious/stateofmind13.wordpress.com/11230/"></a> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gofacebook/stateofmind13.wordpress.com/11230/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/facebook/stateofmind13.wordpress.com/11230/"></a> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gotwitter/stateofmind13.wordpress.com/11230/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/twitter/stateofmind13.wordpress.com/11230/"></a> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gostumble/stateofmind13.wordpress.com/11230/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/stumble/stateofmind13.wordpress.com/11230/"></a> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/godigg/stateofmind13.wordpress.com/11230/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/digg/stateofmind13.wordpress.com/11230/"></a> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/goreddit/stateofmind13.wordpress.com/11230/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/reddit/stateofmind13.wordpress.com/11230/"></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=stateofmind13.com&blog=19416533&post=11230&subd=stateofmind13&ref=&feed=1" width="1" height="1">";s:17:"post_image_height";i:554;s:16:"post_image_width";i:846;s:11:"post_visits";i:17;s:18:"post_twitterShares";i:5;s:19:"post_facebookShares";i:87;s:16:"post_totalShares";i:92;s:16:"post_socialScore";i:35;s:13:"post_virality";i:36;s:9:"blog_name";s:24:"A Separate State of Mind";s:16:"blog_description";N;s:8:"blog_url";s:24:"http://stateofmind13.com";s:11:"blog_author";s:10:"Elie Fares";s:28:"blog_author_twitter_username";s:9:"eliefares";s:13:"blog_rss_feed";s:30:"http://stateofmind13.com/feed/";s:9:"blog_tags";s:17:"politics, society";s:2:"id";i:134;s:11:"blog_active";i:1;s:24:"blog_last_post_timestamp";i:1405494780;s:6:"col_id";N;s:8:"col_name";N;s:16:"col_media_source";N;s:13:"col_home_page";N;s:13:"col_shorthand";N;s:26:"col_media_source_shorthand";N;s:27:"col_author_twitter_username";N;s:8:"col_tags";N;s:15:"col_description";N;s:23:"col_last_post_timestamp";N;}i:2;O:8:"stdClass":36:{s:7:"post_id";i:32806;s:8:"post_url";s:69:"http://monkyseemonkydo.com/2014/07/16/•nate-eiesland•drifting•/";s:10:"post_title";s:30:"•Nate Eiesland•Drifting•";s:10:"post_image";s:65:"http://monkyseemonkydo.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/on_an_on_4.jpg";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:123:"Who?

<p> </p>
<p><b>Why was REDAL created?</b></p>
<p><span>We created an association that aims at pooling the major developers in an effort to better communicate our role to various governmental and other economic parties, as well as the public at large. </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>What’s your take on new tax proposals?</b></p>
<p><span>We suffer more indirect taxes, I believe, than any other sector.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>How so?</b></p>
<p><span>Stamp fees, registration fees, permits. When we have archeological inspections to go through, we foot the whole bill. We suffer V.A.T. on construction. We don’t recover it. [In a project my company is working on, indirect taxes] will account for 30 to 35 percent of the overall project cost. </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Is getting all of the paperwork in order to start a project complicated?</b></p>
<p>Yes. We go through municipalities. We go through the urban planning bodies, including the central one. We go through several other paths from the department of electricity, to EDL, to other services. It really should be one. At least there should be some coordination body where you know what you need to do and how to get it done. All of these procedures, instead of getting simpler, are getting more complicated. The world is going digital, but the government is not. Not in terms of construction permits.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span><b>So how long does it take and what do you have to do to get a construction permit?</b></span></p>
<p><span>Essentially there should be two [bodies to deal with]: There should be the municipality and there should be, in some instances, at least where big projects are involved urban planning. To go to either, you go through the Order of Engineers. If you’re developing downtown, in the area controlled by Solidere, you have to go through Solidere as well. Then you have [even more offices to visit] … These [procedures] are not only costly, they’re complicated and they create uncertainty in terms of timeframes. For instance, it’s such a bureaucratic process — I must have been involved in 15 projects, maybe more, since I’ve come back, and I don’t think there has been one where I haven’t learned a new turn … I haven’t seen anyone who defends the system. Not the mayor of Beirut, not the head of the Directorate General of Urbanism, not the head of the order of engineers. </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>What’s the solution?</b></p>
<p><span>We need one body. One body to go to. </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>In terms of monitoring construction, are there enough state inspectors to make sure projects are being built safely and in line with the laws on the books?</b></p>
<p><span>I truly believe the quality of construction has improved. It has certainly improved in the up-market sector.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Is that because of a private sector initiative or because of more inspectors or better inspection?</b></p>
<p>I think it’s unrelated to codes, at least to Lebanese law codes. I think it happened because the reconstruction of Beirut was led by the Solidere effort, and I think you could notice in the 1990s how buildings around Solidere, [in some areas] started looking better … in terms of quality of construction. Also, there are more professional developers now.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>But has there been improvement in inspection and monitoring?</b></p>
<p><span>The government is doing its part. They are now insisting that … [developers] employ something called Bureau de Controle. For fire safety, for such issues, it’s a review of design and implementation but I believe the private sector has a bigger role. Yes the laws are there on all levels … But, to be honest, I don’t see a deterioration in the quality of construction. I see a proliferation, in some parts, in middle-income developments, that are substandard in some aspects. I don’t find it dangerous, but I find waterproofing to be of terrible quality, [for example]. </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>While the government may be doing its job on that front, planning is still a problem in that no one seems to be doing it. Is it too late for urban planning?</b></p>
<p><span>I used to think it was … There are efforts on the part of some of the municipalities to tackle these things, and it’s working. But even they have to go through other bodies, and it’s taking a long time.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Are you pushing legislative fixes for any of the issues you have with the sector?</b></p>
<p><span>Legislation is very important for many things, and we’re finding, for instance, in the fees and tax issues, that it’s more to do with legislation than with policy and policymakers. But I personally believe that, in general, the problem with development in this country, or from the government side, is that the laws are archaic and I think we need more planning than regulation … I don’t think laws can replace planning. And I think that you can criticize Solidere for many things, but there are things that a master planner can do which laws cannot. We need to address these urban disasters and deal with them. And we have to develop around the villages and not destroy the villages themselves. </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>How do we weed out corruption?</b></p>
<p><span>In the last two years, it’s gotten pretty bad. It’s always been, you know. But it’s gotten worse because the economy has weakened, I suppose and because governance has gone to new lows. I do not know where to begin in addressing these issues … From my experience, the corruption does not help you pay less than what is fair [in taxes and fees] … My solution is simply the process. Create one assessment body for all properties and somebody or some committee to appeal to in case there’s something wrong. You can’t deal with 15 bodies when you don’t know why and who and how … I can’t see why it is so hard. I would say simplify the process and find a more objective way of measuring the fees. And look a little more long-term-ish as lawmakers, in terms of understanding the implications of the laws you create and of how simplifying these laws and these measures [can help] … I don’t think the solution is so much for us to fight it as much as it is to continually remind them and say, “Let’s talk about making it all fairer, making it all simpler.” We’re not saying we don’t want to pay. The system is organized enough that nobody can escape paying, no matter what the impression is. We don’t bribe our way and pay less. We ease the documents process because one has to, but that’s besides the real problem.</span></p>

They help us better understand our world and ourselves, especially at complex times such as this latest round of military attacks by Israelis and Palestinians.</p><p>The prevalent global analysis of the fighting is inadequate for anyone who seeks seriously to grasp the three critical dimensions of the fighting – its causes, nature and consequences. </p><p>None of those three dimensions is addressed by the facile nature of politicians’ statements or mainstream media analysis, which tend to emphasize rockets fired by Palestinians from Gaza, Israel’s right to defend itself against such attacks, and speculation about a possible cease-fire or an imminent Israeli ground attack into Gaza.</p><p>Words can help, and in this case it is worthwhile to examine the words that Palestinians use to describe themselves, if we are seriously interested in understanding the core issues that define this conflict. These have manifested themselves since the 1930s in so many different ways, all leading back to a basic issue: The battle between Zionism  and Arabism in Palestine, more particularly the battle between the rights of a Jewish-majority state of Israel and a dismembered and exiled Palestinian community that continues to struggle for its national rights.</p><p>The two leading Palestinian political and military groups that have mobilized their supporters over the past decades are Fatah  and Hamas.  Fatah was founded and for a long time headed by Yasser Arafat, and controls the Palestine  National Authority that manages the West Bank under Israeli tutelage. Hamas came into being in the early 1980s and has dominated the Gaza Strip  for several years now. </p><p> Fatah is a peculiar acronym that comprises, in reverse order, the first three letters of the movement’s name in Arabic, which is Harakat Tahrir Filistin, or the  Palestine Liberation Movement. Hamas is an acronym in Arabic for its full name, which is Harakat al-Muqawama al-Islamiyya, or the Islamic Resistance Movement. The two most important words in their names are “tahrir” and “muqawama,” or “liberation” and “resistance.” In the etymology of Palestinian nationalism, “liberation” and “resistance” are enduring emotional sentiments and political dynamics, because they largely define the nature of Palestinian identity and goals. They are the most important things to understand about how Palestinians feel and behave.</p><p>The once-dominant and vital  Fatah movement has become a sad shell of its former self, with some very bright and patriotic leaders who have totally lost touch with their people in  Palestine and abroad. Hamas has risen to the fore in recent decades mainly because it has more faithfully reflected the will of Palestinians to resist their occupation and subjugation, and to seek liberation and a normal life in their own sovereign state. Hamas’ core mission is “resistance,” whether through military actions that have little impact on Israel or by trying to organize Palestinians politically to improve their living conditions while they await eventual liberation.</p><p>Hamas is a heroic tragedy, simultaneously admirable and sorrowful. It is heroic for many Palestinians because it persists in resisting Zionism’s desire to eliminate Palestinian nationalism and identity as real forces that demand respect and can be manifested in some kind of national sovereignty in Palestine. “Resistance” to Hamas supporters and others means many things at once. It means consistently asserting the Palestinians’ national rights and the need to end their refugee status. It means constantly challenging the oppressive status quo that Palestinians suffer, especially in Gaza. It means consistently increasing Hamas’ technical capabilities in rockets, drones and communications, allowing it to inconvenience Israel more effectively with every new round of fighting.</p><p>Yet Hamas is also tragic because its strategy and tactics both result in repeated mass suffering by Palestinian civilians in the  Gaza Strip and sometimes elsewhere as well. The state of Israel, being the sovereign manifestation of Zionism, has repeatedly shown that it will viciously attack, assassinate, imprison and imperil all Palestinians – in Palestine, Lebanon or elsewhere – to maintain its hold on the land of Palestine. It is possible that Hamas’ long-term strategy of patient steadfastness and continuous resistance will succeed one day in forcing Israel to accept its terms, but that remains only a slim possibility, while the reality is that millions of Palestinians suffer the burden of repeated Israeli attacks on their homes and communities.</p><p>Exiled and subjugated communities such as the Palestinians today usually behave in ways that seem strange to middle class consumers in faraway lands – including fighting apparently futile battles and subjecting their populations to prolonged suffering and death. This can only be understood by appreciating the nature of “resistance” and the allure of “liberation.” That means analyzing the Israeli-Palestinian conflict as a battle between Zionist power and Palestinian liberation that has gone on for almost a century. </p><p>Rami G.

<p> </p>
<p>The main thing to consider while traveling and packing  for your travels is knowing what to pack and how to pack in a Compact Style. That should be the most important thing to consider, since the less we pack the more we can buy from our vacation (that’s what I keep telling myself :D) And one of my main tricks to packing all my essentials in a small toiletry bag is as simple as it gets. I PACK MINIS !!! i know simple !!! all those minis and samples you get as gifts when purchasing full-size products come totally in handy. You can use them when you are away and finish them, so you don’t have to take bottles and tubes back home. Some of the minis you can actually buy from store; The BodyShop, for example carries mini sizes for almost all their products anytime.<br>
So here are my minis:</p>
<p><strong>L’Oreal Elnett Hairspray | Clarins HydraQuench Bi-Phase Serum | The BodyShop Vitamin E Moisturizer | Guerlain Mascara | AVON lipstick | The BodyShop Vitamin E Cream Cleanser | BIO lenses liquid | Viktor&Rolf BobBon perfume</strong></p>

					<div><p>CUPERTINO, Calif. & ARMONK, N.Y.–(<a href="http://www.businesswire.com/" rel="nofollow">BUSINESS WIRE</a>)–Apple® and IBM (NYSE: <a href="http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ibm.com%2Finvestor&esheet=50905160&newsitemid=20140715006655&lan=en-US&anchor=IBM&index=1&md5=0b703f2b62589227d451e96b50f78dd5" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">IBM</a>) today announced an exclusive partnership that teams the market-leading strengths of each company to transform enterprise mobility through a new class of business apps—bringing IBM’s big data and analytics capabilities to iPhone® and iPad®.</p>
<p> </p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Mobility—combined with the phenomena of data and cloud—is transforming business and our industry in historic ways, allowing people to re-imagine work, industries and professions”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The landmark partnership aims to redefine the way work will get done, address key industry mobility challenges and spark true mobile-led business change—grounded in four core capabilities:</p>
<p>• a new class of more than 100 industry-specific enterprise solutions including native apps, developed exclusively from the ground up, for iPhone and iPad;</p>
<p>• unique IBM cloud services optimized for iOS, including device management, security, analytics and mobile integration;</p>
<p>• new AppleCare® service and support offering tailored to the needs of the enterprise; and</p>
<p>• new packaged offerings from IBM for device activation, supply and management.</p>
<p>The new IBM MobileFirst for iOS solutions will be built in an exclusive collaboration that draws on the distinct strengths of each company: IBM’s big data and analytics capabilities, with the power of more than 100,000 IBM industry and domain consultants and software developers behind it, fused with Apple’s legendary consumer experience, hardware and software integration and developer platform. The combination will create apps that can transform specific aspects of how businesses and employees work using iPhone and iPad, allowing companies to achieve new levels of efficiency, effectiveness and customer satisfaction—faster and easier than ever before.</p>
<p>As part of the exclusive IBM MobileFirst for iOS agreement, IBM will also sell iPhones and iPads with the industry-specific solutions to business clients worldwide.</p>
<p>“iPhone and iPad are the best mobile devices in the world and have transformed the way people work with over 98 percent of the Fortune 500 and over 92 percent of the Global 500 using iOS devices in their business today,” said Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO. “For the first time ever we’re putting IBM’s renowned big data analytics at iOS users’ fingertips, which opens up a large market opportunity for Apple. This is a radical step for enterprise and something that only Apple and IBM can deliver.”</p>
<p>“Mobility—combined with the phenomena of data and cloud—is transforming business and our industry in historic ways, allowing people to re-imagine work, industries and professions,” said Ginni Rometty, IBM Chairman, President and CEO. “This alliance with Apple will build on our momentum in bringing these innovations to our clients globally, and leverages IBM’s leadership in analytics, cloud, software and services. We are delighted to be teaming with Apple, whose innovations have transformed our lives in ways we take for granted, but can’t imagine living without. Our alliance will bring the same kind of transformation to the way people work, industries operate and companies perform.”</p>
<p>Apple and IBM’s shared vision for this partnership is to put in the hands of business professionals everywhere the unique capabilities of iPads and iPhones with a company’s knowledge, data, analytics and workflows. Specifically, the two companies are working together to deliver the essential elements of enterprise mobile solutions:</p>
<p>- Mobile solutions that transform business: The companies will collaborate to build IBM MobileFirst for iOS Solutions—a new class of “made-for-business apps” targeting specific industry issues or opportunities in retail, healthcare, banking, travel and transportation, telecommunications and insurance, among others, that will become available starting this fall and into 2015.</p>
<p>- Mobile platform: The IBM MobileFirst Platform for iOS will deliver the services required for an end-to-end enterprise capability, from analytics, workflow and cloud storage, to fleet-scale device management, security and integration. Enhanced mobile management includes a private app catalog, data and transaction security services, and productivity suite for all IBM MobileFirst for iOS solutions. In addition to on-premise software solutions, all these services will be available on Bluemix—IBM’s development platform on the IBM Cloud Marketplace.</p>
<p>- Mobile service and support: AppleCare for Enterprise will provide IT departments and end users with 24/7 assistance from Apple’s award-winning customer support group, with on-site service delivered by IBM.</p>
<p>- Packaged service offerings: IBM is introducing IBM MobileFirst Supply and Management for device supply, activation and management services for iPhone and iPad, with leasing options.</p>
<p>Announced at Apple’s Worldwide Developer Conference in June and available later this year, Apple’s iOS 8 is the biggest release since the launch of the App Store℠, giving users incredible new features and developers the tools to create amazing new apps. For enterprise, iOS 8 builds on the new IT model for a mobilized workforce by improving the way users are informed of how their devices are configured, managed or restricted, with expanded security, management and productivity features.</p>
<p>Apple designs Macs, along with OS X, iLife, iWork and professional software. Apple leads the digital music revolution with its iPods and iTunes online store. Apple has reinvented the mobile phone with its revolutionary iPhone and App Store, and is defining the future of mobile media and computing devices with iPad.</p>
<p>IBM’s 5,000 mobile experts have been at the forefront of mobile enterprise innovation. IBM has secured more than 4,300 patents in mobile, social and security, that have been incorporated into IBM MobileFirst solutions that enable enterprise clients to radically streamline and accelerate mobile adoption, help organizations engage more people and capture new markets.</p>
<p>IBM has made a dozen acquisitions in security in the past decade, has more than 6,000 security researchers and developers in its 25 security labs worldwide that work on developing enterprise-class solutions.</p>

The workshop was lead by the lovely and talented Cynthia Tabcharany, who covered topics on VM from all aspects. I must admit that I attended 3 out 6 classes due to a couple of business trips, and since I work a full-time job, it was a little tricky organizing my time. But with all that, I still managed to attend the class on Friday afternoons at 5.30 and still benefit just as much as the rest of the attendees. Cynthia was always kind enough to recap with me on any important notes I had missed.</p>

<p><!-- more --></p>
<p>The best past of the workshop was the last session where Cynthia took us to the Salvatore Ferragamo store in downtown to apply everything we had learnt. Our job was to rearrange the display of 5 walls in addition to the window display. It may sound like an easy task, but once you’re put there to apply, you’re going to need serious talent and creativity. </p>

<p>If any of you are interested in VM, I strongly advise you to sign up for Cynthia’s class, or take a look at the workshops offered next season and see what catches your attention the most. I personally guarantee you a great experience where you will both learn about a new topic and meet new people you can share ideas with you. All thanks to Tony Abou Ghazaly, the man behind it all, who came up with such a great start up. Don’t forget that The Agenda is now available in Qatar, too. </p>

The village is located in a rather arid region at the foot of the Anti-Lebanon Mountains that separate Lebanon from Syria. Three years ago you could see thistle flying around in the narrow, deserted alleys. Those times seem long lost. The village tripled its population since then, adding 90,000 Syrian refugees to its 35,000 inhabitants, scattered over the hills. Arsal is now more Syrian than Lebanese, and it hosts the highest concentration of improvised settlements in Lebanon.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>According to Ahmad Fleeti, vice president of the Arsal municipality, there have been thousands of refugees taking shelter in Arsal at any given time since the Syrian uprising began. Now there are 90,000 people, most from the Qalamoun region right across the border, where fierce fighting between Syrian rebels and Hezbollah has been raging for the past three weeks.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;The situation is very bad. They barely have food and water. The aid is getting scarce. There were a lot of NGOs working in Arsal, but now there are only few of them,&rdquo; Fleeti said. &ldquo;We have too many refugees in Arsal, and no organization can help them all, not to mention count them all.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Moreover, security-wise, the village is caught between a rock and a hard place. On one hand, residents and refugees, mostly Sunnis, have to face Shiite Hezbollah fighters and checkpoints in the neighboring village, Labweh. The conflict has led to a series of kidnappings and violence. On the other hand, the presence of Syrian rebel brigades using Arsal&rsquo;s farms for shelter has led to many conflicts with Lebanese security forces. Recently, extremist fighters in Qalamoun have raided the town, kidnapped residents or refugees andtortured or executed them.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Setting up an organized refugee camp with proper security would greatly improve the situation, Fleeti said. &ldquo;We suggested this idea to the prime minister, the minister of interior, and the minister of social affairs,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;Arsal is a big region and can host refugee camps. It is close to the borders and its people are compassionate towards Syrian refugees and are always ready to help. Therefore, Arsal was a better suggestion for a camp location then Zahle or the south, for example. The refugees find a safe haven in Arsal. We hope that the authorities we suggested this idea to will cooperate,&rdquo; he added.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But Lebanon is not ready to organize proper camps for the Syrian refugees &ndash; in Arsal or anywhere else. The government has refused to discuss the matter. International organizations avoid the topic officially. Refugees, some host communities, and NGOs, however, warn that the lack of money, humanitarian aid, and security over the influx of refugees may have traumatic consequences in Lebanon.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>According to a recent census released by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) earlier this month, there are over 173,000 Syrian refugees living in 1,259 improvised camps across Lebanon, double that of 2013.</p><p>Social Affairs Minister Rashid Derbas calls them &ldquo;illegal camps,&rdquo; as the Lebanese government has not agreed to the creation of the settlements. The Lebanese cabinet failed to reach a decision to organize the presence of Syrian refugees after the&nbsp;March 8&nbsp;Alliance ministers adamantly refused to engage in any discussion over the matter.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>According to the UNHCR, most of the improvised settlements are located in the northern region of Akkar and in the Bekaa Valley, and most of those in regions inhabited by Sunni populations.</p><p>Residents of improvised settlements feel they would be safer in an organized camp supervised by the Lebanese state and international organizations. It is not just a question of getting aid, a woman from one of the camps in Bar Elias in western Bekaa told NOW, it&rsquo;s also a question of safety. &ldquo;Some of the landlords ask for rent for the land we use for our tents,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;They ask for $600 dollars a year for five to six square meters.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She also said that camp residents are subject to harassment and that they can&rsquo;t find work to provide for their families. Aid, she said, is almost nonexistent. &ldquo;Many organizations come and visit the camp, they make promises, and because there is no authority to deal with them, they simply forget to come back.&rdquo;</p><p>The UN agencies working with refugees have already sounded the alarm over the growing number of Syrian refugees in Lebanon. &nbsp;By the end of the year there could be more than 1.5 million Syrian refugees in Lebanon, accounting for almost a third of the nation&rsquo;s population.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The UN has not made any statements on the necessity of setting up organized refugee camps in Lebanon, but they do pressure the Lebanese government, especially with the security situation deteriorating day by day and the lack of funding for humanitarian aid. UNHCR head Ant&oacute;nio Guterres has said that "failing to provide enough humanitarian support for Syrian refugees by the end of 2014 could result in dramatic consequences for refugees and the stability of the entire region, including a serious security threat to Lebanon."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So far in 2014, donors have contributed some $1.1 billion to the Syria Regional Response Plan, but this represents only 30% of the revised requirements against the new estimate of 3.6 million Syrian refugees in the region by the end of 2014. Lebanon, in turn, has received only 23% of those funds, even though it hosts the largest number of Syrian refugees.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Lebanon has also paid the highest price for hosting so many Syrian refugees in terms of security. And while a significant number of security incidents have had to do with the lack of money for aid, security forces&rsquo; lack of organization in dealing with scattered Islamist cells taking shelter in refugee communities have contributed to terrorist attacks, an NGO worker in Akkar who requested anonymity told NOW. &ldquo;We are dealing with a large mass of desperate people. They have nowhere to go, they have no means to support themselves in Lebanon, and we&rsquo;ve seen Lebanese ministers making a lot of controversial statements basically telling them that they are not wanted here,&rdquo; the aid worker said. &ldquo;How do you expect them not to radicalize?&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Myra Abdallah contributed reporting.</p><p>                                      According to UNHCR, there are at least 173,000 Syrian refugees living in improvised settlements across Lebanon.
