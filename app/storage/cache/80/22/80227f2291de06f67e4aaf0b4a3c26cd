  Whether you’re out lounging poolside catching some rays, or brunching at a bistro with friends from out of town, or even hitting the dance floor hard like a smashed adolescent, only a killer cocktail can keep you cool and quenched.
  
  Here’s your trustworthy guide to summer’s favorite treats - in sippable form, of course - and who’s brewing them best. Now here’s something worth toasting to!   									    			  									    				
  									    														    						Image via Tumblr  									    															    				 									    			</p><p>  									    			It’s built a cult following around its impeccable pain perdu, but did you know that the bistro du coin Couqley serves up one mean Bloody Mary during weekend brunch? Nicknamed the hangover cure, this cocktail features slow-roasted tomatoes muddled with cracked peppercorn, steak sauce (from their legendary steak-frites, no doubt) and Cajun spices, finished with a liberal dose of pepper-infused vodka. You’ll love how the celery and occasionally cucumber spears are fastened into place by the cubed ice.

Amethyste is a fabulous chill-out lounge located inside the Phoenicia Hotel, a welcoming atmosphere of both opulence and comfort. Order the Sub-Zero Gold Corona punch, a blend of icy cold Corona beer mashed with Gold tequila, twisted mint sprigs and thinly-sliced lemon laced with Tabasco. A potent punch that will make your lips pucker!

Here you’ll find unique décor like designer Roberto Cavalli’s iconic animal prints, a tempting chocolate display, and a long brass-and-wooden bar serving sophisticated cocktails. The passion fruit martini is the house specialty, and it is divinity incarnate. A shot of citrus vodka, another of white cranberry juice, a squeeze of fresh passion fruit, some orange liqueur and a hollowed out passion fruit for garnish make this drink uplifting and irresistible. Indulge!

You know what I’m talking about - the famous Moscow Mule! GardenState, an open-air terrace and the summertime counterpart of Secteur 75, mixes a tempting concoction of this essential cocktail. Pair it with the house sliders for a taste of late-night summer BBQs.

Make no mistake, Sky Bar has earned its bragging rights and worldwide acclaim, and not simply for its posh venue and breathtaking sea views. Its cocktails are among the most innovative to be had in the Lebanese capital. The Chilled Vodka-Loaded Watermelon is a summer must, as is the Blueberry Bellini with fresh blueberry and orange muddled with crème de cassis and Moët & Chandon champagne. For something slightly tarter, try the English Herbs, a concoction of gin, basil, thyme, lime, and 7UP.

  Ahhhh the holy month. This is my time to meditate, to love, to pray, to be patient. They say one reflects best when they are stripped of their desires and, simply said, this month will be one of contemplation and reflection.
  
  Reality:

  Rampant hunger fests. Getting angry at my younger brother for playing drums. Bickering over everything. Yes, I contemplate. I contemplate eating food. 
  
  Expectation:

  Five minutes before ftoor, and everyone fasting expects to devour the entire table from the sambusek appetizers and lentil soup, to the kibbeh,  fattoush and strawberry cheesecake.
  
  Reality:
  
  (Image via Tumblr)
  
  False. Everyone is full by the time they get to the kibbeh, but they push on regardless for fear of seeming weak. This will result in overrating, which causes bloating, anger and discontent.
  
  Expectation:

  Suhur will be graceful and joyous. My family and I are going to wake up, munch on delicious and fresh saj, and have good times.
  
  Reality:

  I can’t get myself to wake up. Also, why can’t I find any leftover pizza from yesterday? I’m not about to go down the elevator to pick up a sandwich from b2b. I better find that leftover pizza.
  
  Expectation:

  If I drink three bottles of water during su7ur, I won’t wake up thirsty. I got this.
  
  Reality:

  No. Nope. Nada. Still thirsty.

  Not missing a re-run of Gossip Girl.

  Finishing up the Hunger Games book series because reading is productive, and I have more free time at home during Ramadan.

  Actually experiencing the "hunger games" in real life. May the odds be in our favor.

<p><a href="http://www.executive-magazine.com/society/lebanese-conquered-brazil">Executive Magazine</a> is doing a special report this month about Lebanese in Brazil, by giving a historical overview and compiling the success stories of several Lebanese personalities. As most of us know or have heard, there are at least 6 million Brazilians of Lebanese origin and Lebanese in Brazil have made it to the top in many fields. </p>

<p>As far as I know, Ahmaz people were not really hiding their political allegiance, so they must have seen it coming. For those of you who don’t know <a href="https://www.facebook.com/starscom">Stars Group</a>, they basically mobile phones to the majority of shops in Lebanon and always get the new phones ahead of others somehow. </p>
<blockquote><p>As the Treasury Department announced today, the United States targeted a key Hizbullah procurement network by designating brothers Kamel Mohamad Amhaz and Issam Mohamad Amhaz; their business, Stars Group Holding, which is based in Beirut and has subsidiaries in China and the UAE; and certain managers and individuals who supported their illicit activities,” the U.S. State Department said in a statement.</p>
<p>Later on Thursday, a Stars Group manager denied the accusations in remarks to LBCI television, saying his firm had not yet received the sanctions decree in an official manner. “Hizbullah relies heavily on front companies such as Stars Group Holding, which continue to procure dual-use material for the organization to enhance its military capabilities,” the State Department said in its statement.</p>
<p>It accused Stars Group Holding of covertly purchasing sophisticated electronics and other technology from suppliers around the world, including “a range of engines, communications, electronics, and navigation equipment.”</p></blockquote>";s:17:"post_image_height";i:573;s:16:"post_image_width";i:1311;s:11:"post_visits";i:19;s:18:"post_twitterShares";i:1;s:19:"post_facebookShares";i:16;s:16:"post_totalShares";i:17;s:16:"post_socialScore";i:31;s:13:"post_virality";i:23;s:9:"blog_name";s:11:"Blog Baladi";s:16:"blog_description";s:89:"a non-political Lebanese blog that tackles various issues related to the Lebanese society";s:8:"blog_url";s:21:"http://blogbaladi.com";s:11:"blog_author";s:11:"Najib Mitri";s:28:"blog_author_twitter_username";s:7:"LeNajib";s:13:"blog_rss_feed";s:27:"http://blogbaladi.com/feed/";s:9:"blog_tags";s:7:"society";s:2:"id";i:22;s:11:"blog_active";i:1;s:24:"blog_last_post_timestamp";i:1405290000;s:6:"col_id";N;s:8:"col_name";N;s:16:"col_media_source";N;s:13:"col_home_page";N;s:13:"col_shorthand";N;s:26:"col_media_source_shorthand";N;s:27:"col_author_twitter_username";N;s:8:"col_tags";N;s:15:"col_description";N;s:23:"col_last_post_timestamp";N;}i:7;O:8:"stdClass":36:{s:7:"post_id";i:32572;s:8:"post_url";s:79:"http://whatrhymeswithellen.com/2014/07/11/lebanon-attends-alcoholics-anonymous/";s:10:"post_title";s:36:"Lebanon Attends Alcoholics Anonymous";s:10:"post_image";s:43:"http://img.youtube.com/vi/zEdCsinK-xY/0.jpg";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:123:"Lebanon is an alcoholic and Karine Sawan has the 12-step program that will make all its problems go away.

<p>It looks like the series of outright destruction and theft of Lebanon’s archeological treasures continues. Today, while walking by, a close friend noticed ruins being excavated on a new lot prepped for construction between the Bank Audi HQ and the Elie Saab HQ, just a stone’s throw away from the Prime Minister’s HQ (quite a fancy neighborhood, huh?).</p>
<p>The gate was mistakenly left open, allowing for a photo, before my friend was hurriedly escorted away and the gate sealed. When asked why, the gatekeeper rudely said, “yeah, they’re being stolen. You can’t take photos here.”</p>
<p>Till when? After priceless landmarks like the first Port in Beirut, Beirut’s ancient gate, and other gems keep being plundered silently, or just filled in with cement at night when no one is watching…</p>

<p align="center">Inspiré de <em>Conseils à une parisienne</em> d’Alfred de Musset</p>
<p>Oui, si j’étais homme, violent et coléreux</p>
<p>Je voudrais, monsieur,</p>
<p>Faire comme vous;</p>
<p>Sans peur ni pitié, sans tragédie ni drame,</p>
<p>A toutes les femmes</p>
<p>Faire un mauvais coup</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Je voudrais n’avoir de soucis au monde</p>
<p>Que ma bouche qui gronde</p>
<p>Mon ventre chéri</p>
<p>Et de pied en cap être le géôlier</p>
<p>Le mieux équipé</p>
<p>De Tyr à Tripoli</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Je voudrais garder pour toute science</p>
<p>Cette insouciance</p>
<p>Qui vous va si bien;</p>
<p>Joindre, comme vous, à l’étourderie</p>
<p>Cette rêverie</p>
<p>Qui ne pense à rien</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Je voudrais pour moi qu’il fût toujours fête</p>
<p>Et briser la tête</p>
<p>A la plus innocente, corps merveilleux</p>
<p>Etre en même temps de glace et de flamme</p>
<p>Amant dans l’âme</p>
<p>Prédateur dans les yeux</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Je détesterais avant toute chose</p>
<p>Ces “Non” en prose</p>
<p>Qui me tapent sur les nerfs</p>
<p>Je tiendrais, dans ma main de fer</p>
<p>Un couteau bien taillé</p>
<p>Pour poignarder celle qui ose me dénigrer</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Car c’est si dévalorisant et c’est si incommode</p>
<p>Cette désobéissance à la mode</p>
<p>Cet air supérieur !</p>
<p>Ah! Quelle dépravation!</p>
<p>La femme moderne, une déception.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Je voudrais encore</p>
<p>Avoir votre corps</p>
<p>Vos cris de douleurs</p>
<p>Vos regards et vos pleurs</p>
<p>Je voudrais enfin, vous dominer de nouveau</p>
<p>Comme au bon vieux temps, comme il le faut</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Mais moi, je suis femme</p>
<p>Et je ne voudrais pas, si j’étais monsieur</p>
<p>N’être qu’une machine à ordres, dépourvue d’âme</p>
<p>Ou un monstre qui crache du feu</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Voyez-vous, mon cher, au siècle où nous sommes</p>
<p>La plupart des hommes</p>
<p>Sont très inconstants</p>
<p>Sur deux amoureux pleins d’un zèle extrême</p>
<p>La moitié nous aime</p>
<p>Pour passer le temps</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Quand on est femme, il faut être sage</p>
<p>C’est une des obligations</p>
<p>Que nous infligent les traditions</p>
<p>Mais, ne vous en faites pas, monsieur, vous êtes un mage.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Permettez-moi de vous adresser un seul mot</p>
<p>En échange de tous les maux</p>
<p>Dont vous étiez responsable:</p>
<p>Monsieur, personne n’est coupable</p>
<p>Femme et homme sont égaux</p>
<p>Maîtrisez votre égo</p>
<p>Utilisez votre raison</p>

Meet Natasha Abou Moghli, the poised yet personable mistress manning the chic watering hole Bar ThreeSixty on the roof of the Le Gray Hotel in downtown Beirut. At just 25-years-old, she is perhaps the youngest female mixologist in the entire city, but after sipping one of her concoctions - more like guzzling it down, it’s so good - you’ll quickly realize that age has nothing to do with finesse. In fact, Abou Moghli’s youthfulness is refreshing: she’s perpetually smiling, disarmingly approachable, and loves creating pleasurable experiences for her guests.

  Abou Moghli’s foray into mixology was pure serendipity. The eldest of seven children born to a Lebanese father and Pakistani mother, she grew up in Saudi Arabia and washed up on the shores of Lebanon in 2008 to major in marketing at AUST. Like any college kid, she began waitressing at Bob’s Diner in Verdun for extra pocket money. Abou Moghli quickly realized how much she loved being around people and serving them, but she found herself lured to the action behind the bar. She watched the bartender intently as he whipped up cocktails and prepared drinks, and she became entranced. 
  
  When Abou Moghli moved on to Kennedy’s Irish Pub in Hamra, her fascination grew deeper. She struck up a friendship with the bartender, and every evening after her floor shift ended, she’d stand next to him and shadow his techniques.
  
  The leap from Kennedy’s to Le Gray wasn’t overnight. In fact, after Kennedy’s, Abou Moghli held half a dozen roles, shrugging off the garb of waitress and donning the apron of bartender. First at Neighbors in Hamra, then Chili’s Achrafieh, followed by a summer stint at BayView’s C-Lounge in Ain Mreisseh, and then a gig at Liquid in Mar Mikhael. At 9:30 Bar and Grill in Hamra she got her first real taste of bar management, where she’d been hired on to launch the bar, engaging in everything from cost control to menu creation and pricing in addition to actually crafting drinks. 
  
  But after some time, the lengthy hours and the lack of vacation time took a toll on her, and she reluctantly left the beverage scene to try her hands at an administrative job behind a computer. Three months was ample time to convince her she didn’t belong in an office, so as soon as she stumbled upon Le Gray’s online job post seeking a mixologist, she applied. The rest, as they say, is history.
  
  At Bar ThreeSixty, Abou Moghli works solo, and that can be overwhelming on nights when she’s fashioning over 120 drinks. During the summer season, she shifts gears and venues, reigning over Cherry on the Rooftop with the help of a bar-back. And Cherry is in full blossom: with around 140 guests on weekends and 100 on weeknights, Abou Moghli hardly has time for a pause. 
  
  
  
  Her specialty is an espresso martini, which, together with a Physalis and herbs concoction, won her a merit award at Horeca’s Bartender Competition in April. She’s also developed a Gardenia drink for the hotel’s Cigar Lounge offered during the month of June, and her martini sampler is a perennial favorite. I can’t get enough of  her ultra-smooth sangria, dosed generously with wine, fresh seasonal fruit, and a few other clandestine ingredients. Thankfully, it’s available year-round.
  
  So what’s in Abou Moghli’s glass? Believe it or not, she’s a whiskey girl. Tennessee whiskey like Jack Daniel’s is her ultimate comfort drink. But how does a gal who craves the simplicity of a whiskey craft such expertly complex and tasty cocktails? 
  
  “Mixology is like baking,” Abou Moghli confides. “It puts you in a good mood, and it’s soothing.” 
  
  Is being female a plus or minus in her capacity? “Neither,” she says, after some thought. “I think I’m lucky. I’ve been fortunate to have had many helpful mentors along the way. No one’s ever eyed me quizzically or dismissed my motivation.” 
  
  It seems even the toughest character can be charmed with a good drink. </p>";s:17:"post_image_height";i:381;s:16:"post_image_width";i:571;s:11:"post_visits";i:15;s:18:"post_twitterShares";i:0;s:19:"post_facebookShares";i:410;s:16:"post_totalShares";i:410;s:16:"post_socialScore";i:39;s:13:"post_virality";i:48;s:9:"blog_name";N;s:16:"blog_description";N;s:8:"blog_url";N;s:11:"blog_author";N;s:28:"blog_author_twitter_username";N;s:13:"blog_rss_feed";N;s:9:"blog_tags";N;s:2:"id";N;s:11:"blog_active";N;s:24:"blog_last_post_timestamp";N;s:6:"col_id";i:18;s:8:"col_name";s:17:"Beirut City Guide";s:16:"col_media_source";s:10:"Beirut.com";s:13:"col_home_page";s:23:"http://beirut.com/blogs";s:13:"col_shorthand";s:15:"beirutcityguide";s:26:"col_media_source_shorthand";s:15:"beirutcityguide";s:27:"col_author_twitter_username";s:15:"beirutcityguide";s:8:"col_tags";s:7:"society";s:15:"col_description";s:50:"a valuable resource for locals and visitors alike.";s:23:"col_last_post_timestamp";i:1405232390;}i:14;O:8:"stdClass":36:{s:7:"post_id";i:32553;s:8:"post_url";s:25:"http://beirut.com/l/33873";s:10:"post_title";s:51:"A Look at How Lebanese Food Has Been Adopted Abroad";s:10:"post_image";s:61:"http://www.beirut.com/GetImage3/prime/slideshow/33873/600x600";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:0:"";s:7:"blog_id";N;s:14:"post_timestamp";i:1404987584;s:12:"post_content";s:5131:"<p>  									    			Lebanese food is becoming somewhat of a hit worldwide. With heightened public consciousness about eating healthy and naturally, the Lebanese Mediterranean cuisine has stolen the spotlight for its delicious balance of vegetables, whole wheat, grains, herbs, and olive oil. 
  
  But as with anything exported from its motherland, staple Lebanese dishes have undergone slight twists and transformations reflective of their new locales. Who knew that a dozen flavors of hummus could exist? How about an inverted parsley-bulgur tabbouleh? Boy have I got a radical selection for you.
  
  Join me on a riveting food tour du monde for a look at how your Lebanese favorites have been morphed in translation. This is a whole new breed of rebel feed.   									    			  									    				
  									    														    						Glitter and Mud  									    															    				 									    			</p><p>  									    			You love it for its sheer simplicity - puréed chickpeas, creamy tahini, a squeeze of lemon juice, and perhaps a clove or two of garlic. Whirl it all together, and you get pure, unadulterated hummus; the godfather of all mezze; king of the Lebanese spread; the perfect accompaniment to anything and everything. One American brand called Cedar’s spices things up and makes a whopping 20 different flavors of hummus! I’m talking roasted red pepper, chipotle, avocado, artichoke spinach, sun-dried tomato and basil, garden veggie, wasabi (yes—wasabi!) and a whole lot more! It’s like hummus meets every country of the world. I know the traditionalists are probably declaring heresy, but between us, these hummus mutants are actually quite good!   									    			  									    				
  									    														    						Ten Million Miles  									    															    				 									    			</p><p>  									    			And what medium do the Americans employ to scoop up said hummus deviants? Sliced wonder bread surely won’t do. Enter Stacy’s Simply Naked Pita Chips, a brand of your favorite Frito Lay snacks. Dressed in nothing but sea salt, these pita chips are pretty much thick Lebanese bread toasted to a perfect crunch. They’ve got the structure and rigidity you’ve always yearned for, easily scooping hummus, guacamole, Pico de Gallo, French onion dip, chili beans - virtually anything.  I think they’re the new contender for modern gourmet nachos.   									    			  									    				
  									    														    						Cupcake Diaries Blog  									    															    				 									    			</p><p>  									    			When I moved to Paris, I spotted a box labeled “taboulé” in the fridge aisle and advertised as prêt-a-manger, or food on the go. Flush with excitement, I bought a pack, peeled back the lid and stared in disbelief at what looked to me like a couscous salad with parsley as an afterthought. In fact, the French take on tabbouleh is semolina, bell peppers, tomatoes, plump raisins for a bit of tangy sweetness, and a stray flat-leaf parsley or two in the entire mash-up—who knew this green herb could be so precious? Tasty, yes. But an absurdly far cry from what we hail as tabbouleh in Lebanon and the Levant.   									    			  									    				
  									    														    						Carrefour  									    															    				 									    			</p><p>  									    			Another Franco-Libanais innovation is “le kafta poulet” wrap. At Chez Le Libanais, a hole-in-the-wall Lebanese joint not far from the famed Saint Michel fountain in Paris, you can opt for a traditional zaatar man’ouche, or you can sink your teeth into something a bit more complex that I like to dub “la7me b3ajjin à la djej.” Loosely-ground chicken minced with onions, green herbs and pepper is spread generously on a round flatbread saj and, once heated, topped with heaps of garlic paste, lettuce, tomato, and cornichons. Bound into a wrap, this sandwich is, in a word, incredible.   									    			  									    				
  									    														    						Yelp  									    															    				 									    			</p><p>  									    			When we think of falafel, our mind conjures up a pita bread sandwich stuffed with the iconic ground chickpea-and-fava-bean balls, tarator (tahini sauce with parsley), pickled horseradish, tomato and radishes. Full stop. Nothing more. Well, the people at Amsterdam Falafelshop like to do things a little bit differently, and we’re talking a full-on garnish bar where you can stuff your sandwich silly with over 21 sauces and toppings. You’ve got red cabbage, sauerkraut, fried cauliflower, fried eggplant, hummus, baba ghannouj, beets, Greek salad, tzatziki sauce—wait, wait, I’m not through—Dutch mayo, homemade peanut ‘saus,’ malt vinegar, Old Bay Seasoning, ketchup, and more. Your sandwich ends up looking like a falafel cornucopia.

The holy season of Ramadan is a reminder of how precious are the things we often take for granted, sustenance (aka grub) being the prime example. 
  
  This year, break bread at these recommended restaurants which, beyond the trite Jallab-Dates-Fattouch-Chicken-Kellaj combo, propose something on the same footing with divine. Siem ma2boul!

A fusion of Lebanese, Moroccan and French cuisines all in one, Momo has crafted a ravishing multi-course menu that transforms every week during the holy month. Start with the requisite Jallab or Amareddine drink; dive into a traditional Algerian shorba followed by a tangy fattouch; enjoy a selection of cold and hot mezze like merguez t’chakchouka and chicken pastilla; sink your teeth into rich seafood tajine or Momo’s specialty couscous; and end on a sweet note of Osmalieh, Kellaj, Oum Ali and seasonal fruit. A steal at 65,000 LL, if you ask me.

Save room for the main, which varies daily and features seafood dishes—Paella, fish frikeh, siyaddieh—and mixed grills or steak for the seafood-averse. The sahlab dessert is not to be missed.

Though nearly impossible, save room for dessert, particularly the Oum Ali: an Egyptian-inspired bread pudding served hot with sweetened milk, cream, raisins, and coconut.

<p>Well, I was actually raised Muslim. My last Ramadan was actually a summer Ramadan. It’s the worst time to fast, and I was already not too confident about my faith in the whole Islam deal, so I pretty much gave up. I like to think a lot of people leave the faith around this time. Like if the Muslim global committee has a NASA-esque command center somewhere in a mountain in Saudi Arabia, they’re all shouting at screens and watching a graph move downward. “Damn it, we’re losing them!”. But actually, it’s a little bit of the opposite. Ramadan is the time when people actually remember their faith in many cases. Muslims who haven’t lifted a finger for prayer, fasting (did you know it’s not just a Ramadan thing? Most Muslims don’t seem to), charity or any of the other Muslimy things suddenly get all Muslimy around Ramadan. For some reason fasting seems to be the one where all the prodigal sons return to the faith. Something about fasting might appeal to people, I guess. Others like to appear cosmopolitan by insisting that they’re doing it as a sort of diet program (It’s been proven to have SOME positive effects but it’s not exactly top-notch). Maybe some like the competitive aspect of it, like it’s some kind of reality TV challenge where you starve yourself for 9 hours and then enter an eating decathlon.</p>
<p>I’m not a religious person (that’s my attempt to sound moderate; I’m actually a militant atheist who knows how repetitive his rants can get), but I think you really contemplate and consider the thing you’re doing, religiously speaking. I personally left religion and think it’s a stupid waste of time (see that’s why I try to keep a lid on the rants) but I can still at least respect someone who has really turned it over and their heads and has decided to pursue a religious lifestyle. I think if you’re going to undertake a significant religious endeavor, there are some things you should do.</p>
<h2>Figure out why you’re fasting</h2>
<p>Another thing some people seem to lose track of is the fact that fasting is by no means exclusive to Islam. Pretty much every faith has it, and even quite a few new-agey made-up ones have it as well but I think they do it with juices. So Ramadan is part of a rich, varied and multicultural tradition of starving yourself to show God you love him more than food (God lost that contest with me). But see, nobody seems to want to investigate that tradition at all. Okay maybe not nobody, but it’s shocking to see the number of people who assume that fasting is just God’s way of reminding us how much it sucks to be poor (that’s actually the answer I’ve gotten from a lot of people). I mean most people understand the general idea, which is that God is always going to ask you to do stuff you don’t feel like doing and that makes you a better person who’s more worthy of his love. But try to get a better idea of that concept. Look into fasting, and look into the rationale behind it, because that sort of thing should matter to you. And of course, understand the Islamic reasons behind it if you’re fasting Islamically.</p>
<h2>Don’t be an asshole about fasting</h2>
<p>Good news Muslims! Did you know you can be a complete fucking dick to people in Ramadan, and when they call you out on it, be like ‘I’m fasting!’. I’m not a scriptural man, but I’m fairly sure there’s no religious stipulation that religious sacrifice is some big fucking favor you’re doing God or anybody else for that matter. If you’re doing it for some kind of big shiny medal, I think you’re missing the point of the whole exercise. It’s part of your religious rituals and it’s something you have acknowledged as a duty, and something you should be humble about it. It’s not very spiritual to bitch and moan. I’m pretty sure Ghandi didn’t go around losing his temper at people and bitching about his hunger strikes. Or maybe he did but that didn’t make it into the memoir. I don’t think it’s asking much more if you just try to be patient throughout the whole thing because THAT’S THE WHOLE POINT. Also, if somebody eats in front of you when you’re fasting, kindly avoid being an asshole about it. If I wanted to fast too I’d go back to Islam, crawling on my hands and knees like my sheikh said I would (not a true story).</p>
<h2>Make an effort to be more charitable</h2>
<p>This is advice to everyone, not just the Muslims. I think we’re always so ready to criticize religious rites and their societal role that we forget the legitimate good that religion does bring. Try to remember that you are encouraged to be charitable in the month of Ramadan as Muslims, as that’s something I can get behind no matter what your motivation is. Instead of bringing enough food to feed a small village to your table, why not give it to, oh I don’t know, A SMALL VILLAGE. And secular/irreligious/claims to be Wiccan just to fuck with their parents/humanists, definitely make an effort to be charitable as well. I see a lot of good behavior in Ramadan and it reminds me that religions do promote altruistic behavior in people. Which makes me want to be altruistic just to show up the religious people. Nothing says charity like a little spite.</p>
<p>Aside from all that, happy Ramadan! Oh and check with your doctor to make sure you don’t have any health concerns. If you do, you’re exempt, enjoy running inside to have a drink of water and then enduring everyone’s judgmental stares.</p>";s:17:"post_image_height";i:0;s:16:"post_image_width";i:0;s:11:"post_visits";i:29;s:18:"post_twitterShares";i:3;s:19:"post_facebookShares";i:68;s:16:"post_totalShares";i:71;s:16:"post_socialScore";i:46;s:13:"post_virality";i:34;s:9:"blog_name";s:11:"Gino's Blog";s:16:"blog_description";s:79:"Home of FASHAL, The Weekly Leaks, and everything you love and hate about Beirut";s:8:"blog_url";s:21:"http://ginosblog.com/";s:11:"blog_author";s:10:"Gino Raidy";s:28:"blog_author_twitter_username";s:9:"ginoraidy";s:13:"blog_rss_feed";s:26:"http://ginosblog.com/feed/";s:9:"blog_tags";s:7:"society";s:2:"id";i:45;s:11:"blog_active";i:1;s:24:"blog_last_post_timestamp";i:1405076820;s:6:"col_id";N;s:8:"col_name";N;s:16:"col_media_source";N;s:13:"col_home_page";N;s:13:"col_shorthand";N;s:26:"col_media_source_shorthand";N;s:27:"col_author_twitter_username";N;s:8:"col_tags";N;s:15:"col_description";N;s:23:"col_last_post_timestamp";N;}i:19;O:8:"stdClass":36:{s:7:"post_id";i:32543;s:8:"post_url";s:25:"http://beirut.com/l/34467";s:10:"post_title";s:48:"Five Conversations Every Lebanese Person Has Had";s:10:"post_image";s:61:"http://31.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mcujg8VlNd1rhn75ko1_500.gif";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:195:"In our small society, the themes in our life can become repetitive - much like the conversations.

  The Help</b>

  How many times have you had dinner guests compliment you on your housekeeper as if you birthed and raised her yourself?  I have heard this ridiculous conversation at many dinner parties and it is almost always accompanied by stories of how well everyone treats their housekeeper. Society ladies are always so shocked that their housekeeper ran away! After all, they did let her call home TWICE this year. 
  
  The Charity</b>

  What is the point of feeding orphans if you can’t go out and brag about it the next night?  It is even better if you manage to Instagram some pictures of your charitable soul. You need to publicize your good deeds as much as possible, otherwise it's like they don’t even count. Lebanese people love discussing how selfless they are, from how they cried for hours after seeing that old homeless man on the street to how they hosted hundreds of unprivileged people for dinner. 
  
  The Bomb Survival</b>

  “I was JUST there…….. last Thursday.” “I had JUST turned that exact corner……. two years ago.”  For some reason, everyone always seems to have just fled the bomb scene moments before it went off. 
  
  The Refugees</b>

  How many cars with Syrian license plates did you see yesterday? Because my mom’s friend saw like 20, you guys. This conversation is gaining popularity fast.
