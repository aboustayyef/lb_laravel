But unfortunately, far too many apartments and even so-called villas of our day and age fit the caveman ticket at least in their exteriors. Cities today, just like the past 100 years have the flair of stacked caves that are crowded into buildings are deficient of character. They are structures built from primitive design or shortsighted greed, or both. Consequently, millions of buildings in thousands of cities are only theoretically conducive of social life and economic activity, lacking structural character that would support their owners and tenants in improving their lives.</p>
<p>Beirut also is stacked with buildings that create feelings ranging from distance to disgust, whether as fancy but wholly unimaginative towers or as barely functional boxes used for commerce, housing, leisure or education. But that is not the whole truth. There is not only a small and dwindling portfolio of heritage buildings that help the city to breathe civilization, there is also a small but growing stock of new buildings that represent ingenuity and some that even make us think — and perhaps help us think more constructively.</p>
<p>When Executive last month surveyed one such building, the new home of the Issam Fares Institute think tank on the grounds of the American University of Beirut, IFI director Rami Khouri said that the new building had immediately boosted his team’s ability “to do better work.” Part of this was due to the structure’s information and communications technology features and the high visibility that the building provided. But another part of the productivity gains derives from the building’s design and the conducive environment that it generates, Khouri said, inspiring staffers to conduct their “core activities with much greater enthusiasm.”</p>
<p>With a tip of the hat to the project owners, architects and developers that have invested themselves in unconventional projects, Executive has put together a selection of recently completed buildings that impress us as concepts, and which give us something to think about. Some may even be seen as entrenched, positive elements of the city’s fabric in 100 years time.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The sparks that appear on the baseball-sized rock (starting at :17) result from the laser of the ChemCam instrument on NASA’s Curiosity Mars rover hitting the rock.</p>
<p>ChemCam’s laser zapping of this particular rock was the first time the team used Curiosity’s arm-mounted Mars Hand Lens Imager (MAHLI) camera to try and capture images of the spark generated by the laser hitting a rock on Mars. Their efforts were a success.</p>
<p>The video is compiled from single images from the MAHLI camera, taken during the 687th Martian day, or sol, of Curiosity’s work on Mars (July 12, 2014).</p>
<p>Since Curiosity landed in Mars’ Gale Crater in August 2012, researchers have used ChemCam’s laser and spectrometers to examine more than 600 rock or soil targets. The laser itself has been fired more than 150,000 times. The process, called laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy, hits a target with pulses from the laser to generate sparks, whose spectra provide information about which chemical elements are in the target. Multiple laser shots are fired in sequence, each blasting away a thin layer of material so that the following shot examines a slightly deeper layer. In this case, “Nova” displayed an increasing concentration of aluminum as a series of laser shots from the rover penetrated through dust on the rock’s surface.</p>

This part holds the kickstand as well as a battery, which we praised heavily on the previous model as it offers an impressive 9000 mAh of power.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.absolutegeeks.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Lenovo-Yoga-Tablet-10-HD-6-e1405620565875.jpg" rel="lightbox-0"><img src="http://www.absolutegeeks.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Lenovo-Yoga-Tablet-10-HD-6-1024x576.jpg" alt="Lenovo Yoga Tablet 10 HD (6)" width="838" height="471"></a></p>
<p>The body has been fully crafted out of magnesium alloy, which combined with a smooth front glass surface leaves the impression of a premium device — right off the bat, anyone can see that the Yoga Tablet 10 HD+ is not your average tablet. The elegant side line with slightly rounded edges also contributes to the pleasurable feeling while using it.</p>
<p>This device comes in at 1.4 pounds (615 grams). Due to the shifted center of gravity it does not tire out the hand for the most part, we found that the 10″ version does get somewhat heavy on the wrist over a prolonged duration, something not felt in its 8″ older smaller and lighter sibling.</p>

<p>The most notable and unique feature of the Yoga 10 HD+ is the kickstand and cylindrical bulge on the side. This allows for two functionalities/features that make the tablet stand out from the competition: The battery (addressed later in the review), and the kickstand.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>The Kickstand</h2>
<p>Lenovo has always been a market leader in producing devices that can perform in versatile ways. It’s Yoga family of products are testament to that positioning. The Yoga tablet is no different. The Kickstand allows the tablet to be rested in a number of ways without the need to add a cover or accessories to achieve this.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.absolutegeeks.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Lenovo-Yoga-Tablet-10-HD-11-e1405620707745.jpg" rel="lightbox-2"><img src="http://www.absolutegeeks.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Lenovo-Yoga-Tablet-10-HD-11-1024x677.jpg" alt="Lenovo Yoga Tablet 10 HD (11)" width="838" height="554"></a></p>
<p>This allows for three usage modes: the Hold, Tilt and Stand.  In Hold mode, the weight of the device falls into your palm rather than your fingers, making it more comfortable for reading and browsing.  Lay it down into Tilt mode and you have a perfect viewing angle for typing or gaming. Flick the kickstand and rest it upright in Stand mode to comfortably watch videos, listen to music, or video-chat.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Display</h2>
<p>The most immediately evident change to the upgraded Lenovo Yoga Tablet 10 is the increase of the screen resolution. Instead of a mere 1280 x 800 pixels, this tablet now has Full HD resolution, i.e. 1920 x 1200 pixels, increasing pixel density from a humble 149 ppi to a more pleasant 224 ppi. From a usual distance, individual pixels can no longer be spotted with the naked eye, and displayed items do not seem even slightly blurred, as the case was with the first Yoga Tablet 10.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.absolutegeeks.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Lenovo-Yoga-Tablet-10-HD-9-e1405620850991.jpg" rel="lightbox-6"><img src="http://www.absolutegeeks.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Lenovo-Yoga-Tablet-10-HD-9-1024x801.jpg" alt="Lenovo Yoga Tablet 10 HD (9)" width="838" height="655"></a></p>
<p>The contrast has also been improved, so it is now above average for a mid-range tablet. Black tones are now exceptionally dark, but the white tones could be a bit less ‘dirty’, i.e. lighter. The colors are realistically interpreted and quite vivid, yet not overly saturated, which can often be the case (and which many users actually like) with more advanced tablets. However, contrast sustainability still has certain shortcomings, especially when the display is exposed to direct sunlight, while the viewing angle is satisfactory and relatively wide.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.absolutegeeks.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Yoga-10HD-3D-Gaming-Screenshot-2.jpg" rel="lightbox-7"><img src="http://www.absolutegeeks.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Yoga-10HD-3D-Gaming-Screenshot-2-1024x640.jpg" alt="Yoga 10HD 3D Gaming Screenshot 2" width="838" height="523"></a></p>
<p>Thanks to a new active ambient lighting sensor, automatic display brightness adjustment has more balance than the previous Yoga Tablet 10 featured. We found that the brightness adjustment is sometimes not subtle enough with fast and large dips or spikes in brightness (delayed optimization) depending on the ambient light.</p>
<p>All in all, the display offers an experience similar to that of premium Android tablets, and it is one of the best of the mid-range 10-inch devices.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Software</h2>
<p>Not much is different here from Lenovo’s other tablets and smartphones. Lenovo does seem to start building up its own ecosystem of apps and services that compliment its range of products. With built-in apps like SHAREit, SYNCit HD and SECUREit HD.</p>
<p>SHAREit provides file sharing on multiple devices (tablet, smartphone and PC), it’s Lenovo’s version of Apple’s Airdrop. The process gets a bit long when sharing with devices that don’t have SHAREit installed, but it’s still great because, unlike Airdrop, it does share with multiple platforms (Mac, PC, Android).</p>
<p><a href="http://www.absolutegeeks.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Yoga-10HD-Multiscreen-Screenshot.jpg" rel="lightbox-8"><img src="http://www.absolutegeeks.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Yoga-10HD-Multiscreen-Screenshot-1024x640.jpg" alt="Yoga 10HD Multiscreen Screenshot" width="838" height="523"></a></p>
<p>SYNCit allows you to sync your preferences and contacts with the cloud, easily retrieving them later on your new Lenovo device or laptop. To us, this is a bit redundant since Google Contacts provides the same functionality and is far more and better connected with Google’s other products.</p>
<p>The tablet also makes use of its 10″ real-estate by enabling a multi-window mode, allowing you to work on two apps at the same time.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Sound and Battery</h2>
<p>Both deserve to be mentioned, but not big enough for their separate sections.</p>
<p>The Yoga Tablet 10 HD+ comes with a Dolby enhanced front speakers, giving deeper and more immersive sounds to your music and videos. The nice thing about this Dolby system, which has its own control panel, is that it is fully customizable and could be changed to accommodate the mode you’re using the tablet in (Hold, Tilt, Stand), all at a flick of a switch.</p>
<p>The battery is nothing short of outstanding. It’s safe to say that we’ve never experienced a battery that lasts this long on any device we’ve tested, ever! At the time of writing this review we logged 7 days and 5 hours of usage on the battery with 23% still left to go! Need we say more!</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Performance</h2>
<p>Let’s get some numbers and key specs out of the way. The Yoga Tablet 10 HD+ sports a Qualcomm Snapdragon 400 quad code 1.6GHz and a 2GB RAM. The unit we reviewed had 16GB of storage space, expandable via SD card slot. The tablet also supports SIM cards for cellular data connection.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.absolutegeeks.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Yoga-10HD-Antutu-Benchmark-Screenshot.jpg" rel="lightbox-9"><img src="http://www.absolutegeeks.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Yoga-10HD-Antutu-Benchmark-Screenshot-640x1024.jpg" alt="Yoga 10HD Antutu Benchmark Screenshot" width="332" height="531"></a></p>
<p>The tablet scored 19363 on AnTuTu Benchmark test. Not too bad, but not as much as we’d hoped for it. It does fit well in its mid-range tablet category though, providing a smooth and streamlined experience throughout. We haven’t experienced any lagging or drop in performance even while running multiple apps in multi-screen mode. 3D games performed smoothly as well, but the quality of the graphics suffered a little as the game optimized its rendering to fit the processor’s capacity.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Wrap up</h2>
<p>The Lenovo Yoga Tablet 10 HD+ is a well rounded tablet that delivers a lot more than what you pay for. At AED 1,499, it’s pretty much a steal. The tablet doesn’t exactly compete with the heavyweights out there like Samsung’s Pro tablet range and Apple’s iPads, but it’s not supposed to do so in the first place.</p>
<p>This is a mid-range tablet that is built to address all of an average users needs, delivering them in both style and decent power. The enhanced display resolution is a plus from last year’s model and the battery life is simply unparalleled.</p>
<p>If you’re looking for an affordable, mid-range tablet that has a quality build, versatile viewing modes, enhanced Dolby sound system and a killer battery, the Lenovo Yoga Tablet 10 HD+ is definitely the tablet of choice for you.</p>";s:17:"post_image_height";i:576;s:16:"post_image_width";i:1024;s:11:"post_visits";i:3;s:18:"post_twitterShares";i:9;s:19:"post_facebookShares";i:131;s:16:"post_totalShares";i:140;s:16:"post_socialScore";i:23;s:13:"post_virality";i:40;s:9:"blog_name";s:14:"Absolute Geeks";s:16:"blog_description";s:28:"Unleash The Tech Geek In You";s:8:"blog_url";s:24:"http://absolutegeeks.com";s:11:"blog_author";s:0:"";s:28:"blog_author_twitter_username";s:13:"absolutegeeks";s:13:"blog_rss_feed";s:34:"http://www.absolutegeeks.com/feed/";s:9:"blog_tags";s:4:"tech";s:2:"id";i:268;s:11:"blog_active";i:1;s:24:"blog_last_post_timestamp";i:1405622580;s:6:"col_id";N;s:8:"col_name";N;s:16:"col_media_source";N;s:13:"col_home_page";N;s:13:"col_shorthand";N;s:26:"col_media_source_shorthand";N;s:27:"col_author_twitter_username";N;s:8:"col_tags";N;s:15:"col_description";N;s:23:"col_last_post_timestamp";N;}i:4;O:8:"stdClass":36:{s:7:"post_id";i:32862;s:8:"post_url";s:73:"http://www.absolutegeeks.com/2014/07/17/the-global-app-summit-2014-dubai/";s:10:"post_title";s:36:"The Global App Summit 2014 – Dubai";s:10:"post_image";s:94:"http://www.absolutegeeks.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Screen-Shot-2014-07-17-at-10.28.57.png";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:123:"Do you have an idea that will change the World ?

<p>The announcement is expected before the financial markets open on Thursday morning.

However, I chose to rename it for the purpose of fairness and giving credit where credit was due, since I managed to squeeze in two rides on the same afternoon/evening with two very different experiences.</p>
<p>Some of you who follow me on Twitter might have noticed that I immediately reached out to <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/tech-ticker/~https://twitter.com/Uber_Beirut" target="_blank">Uber Beirut</a> upon news of their launch. I am a big fan of the hailing app concept and have had the chance to try several apps in several countries starting with Romania.</p>
<p>Uber however is not just any app, and regardless of any controversy that you might have heard, these guys have an excellent business model that is spreading like wildfire and I can totally understand why:
<br>
What’s not to like about the promise of ordering a timely, elegant transport with a courteous driver and a friction-less payment method from the comfort of your smartphone?</p>
<h3>My First Ride in Beirut…Uber-Lebanese</h3>
<p>I set out heading from Badaro to LAU Beirut on Saturday (2014-07-12), and placed my order at 18:53. Surely enough, I was notified that the driver would be arriving within 4 minutes. So far so good, but 4 minutes later with no car in sight, I followed up with a short text to the driver indicating exactly where I would wait for him, to avoid any confusion.
<br>
From there on, things went downhill. It took the driver 32 minutes to reach me. I was seriously panicking that I would not be able to make it on time to LAU.</p>
<p><img src="http://i2.wp.com/tech-ticker.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Uber-Driver-Combo.jpg?resize=894%2C800" alt="Uber-Driver-Combo" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<p>I called the driver to inquire how close he was as the car seemed lost in a maze of streets in Achrafieh. He assured me he was close to the museum but what I was seeing in front of me suggested something else. I then finally spotted him coming towards me but stopping to ask for direction, so I called him again. He saw me also and hung up as he pulled up.</p>
<div>As you see from the info above, I was off to a bad start, and had less than 30 minutes to get to my destination. Doors were to close at 19:45 at LAU. As I got into the car I was surprised again that the driver was not familiar with the area and did not know how to make up for lost time to make it there, so I co-piloted and navigated him through my usual road.</div>
<div></div>
<div>I must, however, in all due conscience, say that he seemed really apologetic and stressed that he had been so late and he was really helpful and courteous through the ride, adjusting the cooling and proposing me a drink of water since he saw I had been sweltering in the heat for 30 minutes. He also did his best to get me to my destination on time. I eventually made it on time  and got off just 15 meters away from the lower gate although he proposed to drive me exactly there. I did not want us to get caught in the Koraytem road maze.</div>
<div></div>
<div>I was left perplex on what to make of this experience. On one hand, I had waited in the heat for half an hour and lost my chance for a decent seating at the event, on the other, the vehicle and the driver were up to my expectation in terms of quality and behavior.</div>
<div>I still do not want to categorically draw any conclusions and perhaps traffic was hard on the way to Badaro from Abdel Wahab Street although on a Saturday afternoon in summer, Beirut is usually traffic free.</div>
<h3>Uber Redeemed by Abbas</h3>
<div>After the ceremony in LAU had finished, we decided to grab a bite at the nearby Deek Duke restaurant (<a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/tech-ticker/~https://www.google.com/maps/place/Deek+Duke/@33.895934,35.479451,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0x1f523092cb1590e" target="_blank">Google Map</a>). I wanted to try again taking Uber. My girlfriend had ordered a ride a few hours before me that day and was extremely satisfied. So I opened the app, GPS blasting, and placed an order. A car was assigned to us a few minutes away. I then monitor the driver skillfully avoiding congested roads to make it on time and arriving at the marker that was supposed to represent our location.</div>
<div></div>
<div>However, as we look around, there was no car anywhere near.</div>
<div>I immediately call the driver, and we quickly realize the app had placed us in Bliss not in Hamra. I bare a lot of the responsibility this time as I did not really zoom in and look at the pin.
<br>
However, he reassured me he had understood where we actually were, and sure enough, a few minutes later a sparkling new BMW Series 5 pulls up.</div>
<div><img src="http://i0.wp.com/tech-ticker.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Uber-Abbas.png?resize=720%2C1280" alt="Uber Abbas" data-recalc-dims="1"></div>
<div>A neatly dressed driver disembarks, introduces himself as Abbas, opening the door for us. <span>Once in the car, he apologizes once more (although he was not to blame for a faulty GPS location in the app) and asks if the air conditioning setting was to our liking and we were comfortably seated. The rest of our drive home was smooth as can be and upon our arrival we got the same royal treatment as when we boarded the vehicle.</span></div>
<h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
<p>Sure, some of you will say I am being tough on the first driver and the company, and that a normal Taxi will have lied and weaseled its way out of this, and even not shown up at all.
<br>
But you know what? This is NOT a random taxi company managed by some fat-bellied, sweat-dripping, flip-flop wearing driver. I based my expectations on the reputation of what is the fastest growing company in this field. Just consider this: <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/tech-ticker/~www.forbes.com/sites/stevenbertoni/2014/05/22/surge-pricing-uber-seeking-12-billion-valuation-in-latest-funding-round/" target="_blank">Uber had recently been seeking $12 Billion valuation in its latest funding round</a></p>
<p>In the entire commotion I had not noticed that I had received a mail follow up. Uber had reacted to the rating of the first drive that I had input on the app even before I got to write this blog post and reacted by giving me a 5$ coupon on the spot. I think this is just one facet of how professional these people are. I also think the driver which I had the unfortunate experience with, has the potential of being an excellent driver as he gets more used to the roads and the process as a whole.</p>
<p>Uber did warn us this was a sort of a “beta” release. Therefore, I will cut them some slack in that area but above all I will thank them for one of the best rides home I have had in a very long time.</p>
<p>Regular Lebanese taxi providers are still in a slumber, but they better wake up really fast and get up to speed with the century. They are about to be heavily outclassed and I honestly do not think they can do anything about it, especially those among them with new fleets and cocky attitudes.</p>

<p><a href="https://lfadi.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/1.png"><img src="http://lfadi.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/1.png?w=300&h=266" alt="1" width="300" height="266"></a></p>

<p>The word “falatan” or social mess/chaos has many meanings and can be measured differently according to each society and its traditions. Having sex before marriage for example is not a chaos in Europe, thus a non-virgin European girl can never be considered as a whore regardless of agreeing with the fact or not. Everyone is free in his own life as long as he is not disturbing others’.</p>
<p>Moreover, generalizing a situation taking place in one resort on all resorts is totally unacceptable. Telling that lack of ethics is occurring in Lebanese swimming pools means that most of them to not say all are full of perversity, which is certainly not the case.</p>

<p><em>Source: <a href="http://www.beiruting.com/" target="_blank"><span dir="ltr">beiruting.com</span></a></em></p>
<p>Below are some of the article’s points I totally disagree with and consider as views’ imposition.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Athena is full of prostitution and immorality:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So everyone in Athena is either a streetwalker or a pimp?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mykonos is the uncontrolled capital of gays:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Regardless of being homosexuals not gays, what is surveillance needed for?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nudist beaches and nobody cares:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Why should anybody care? A person opposing such places is free to avoid them.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pool or Cabaret:</p>
</blockquote>
<ul><li>Dancing on the bar while wearing a swimwear is totally normal when on the beach. Many people are avoiding such places since this fact is bothering them and contradicting with their habits, which is totally normal. Every person should respect others’ rules in addition to having his own rules that should be respected.</li>
<li>Many resorts in Lebanon have free entrance for girls before 11:00 or 12:00 due to the bad touristic movement. They are sacrificing access fees with the hope of having more people inside to spend money on food and drinks.</li>
<li>The pool in the article’s photo is 18+ and no kids are allowed inside. Therefore, no harm in children’s education.</li>
</ul><blockquote><p>Porn film – Kissing in the pool before ending up in the bed:</p></blockquote>
<p>I am not willing to comment on this point, mostly that I think having sex in public couldn’t take place in Lebanon without arresting both parties.</p>

<p>P.S.: I am not defending the resort which I think most of us recognized it and I totally agree that morals and ethics should be respected, particularly in public places, but limiting others’ freedom just because you disagree with and generalizing a case as if all resorts in Lebanon are full of prostitution is inadmissible.</p>

<p>What hit us first was the cool neutral white “loungy” venue in Dowtown Dubai, where everything seemed to shout out minimalism and modernity. Until the bright coloured lights came to life (pretty close to the Microsoft logo color pattern), then we totally understood we were aboard a fresh new ride alongside Microsoft taking over Nokia’s legacy in a brand new fashion.</p>
<p>After the meet and greet moments, we went on to mingle with our friends from the regional media, and went straight on to the Corporate keynotes, whereby the Microsoft team laid out their strategy for their mobile division, emphasising on how the Microsoft cross-device experience is meant to go seamless no matter the device used: desktop, laptop, smartphone, tablet, game console… the main effort done on the Windows UI is to unify all aspects in order to make the Windows experience feel like home for the user. And in many ways, the company did achieve this, just by looking at the way things blend in, in terms of global UI, cloud sharing services, and so on.</p>
<p>The highlight of the evening was undeniably the announcement of the Lumia 930, which came right after that of the Lumia 630 and 635, which embodied Microsoft and Nokia’s efforts to bring in the best of smartphone experience to the masses, in the most elegant and complete package you could ever think of at that pricing level.</p>
<p>The Lumia 930 has everything we could ever ask from a modern time flagship smartphone: an awesome design and build quality, lightness in weight, freshness through its back cover color palette (ranging from orange to green, with classic white and black also available), killer specifications (Snapdragon 800 chipset, 2GB of RAM, FullHD OLED ClearBlack display, 20MP Pureview shooter). We undeniably had a smiling grin on our faces, since this was pretty much the very first time we felt that Windows Phone can finally be called “Complete”. This feeling did not only come from design and specs, but also from the inherent feeling the new Windows Phone 8.1 experience brought along. The software now sports almost every single feature available in every other competing smartphone OS out there. I personally was happy, simply because back in the time when Windows Phone was first released to the market, I found it to be the most beautiful UI out there, but immediately felt that there was a long way to go in order to achieve the maturity other OS like iOS or Android were building for themselves. I can finally say now that the mission looks pretty accomplished as of today.</p>
<p>Taken by that same wave of Tech bliss, we had the opportunity to sit with Mr. Ifi Majid, Global Head of Mobile Devices Marketing at Microsoft and ask him a few questions about the new Microsoft experience.</p>
<p></p><hr><ul><li><em>On a personal level, since you’re coming from Nokia initially, how did the whole integration with Microsoft go?</em></li>
</ul><p>The whole thing went seamlessly. It is still an ongoing process, but everything went very naturally. There were no harsh changes in the business, just a boost in terms of motivation, since we feel we have new challenges now.</p>
<ul><li><em>Can you tell us more about the Nokia brand? Will it disappear in favor of Microsoft or any other new branding under Microsoft? Or will it be sustained in an effort to maintain Nokia’s mobile phone legacy?</em></li>
</ul><p>Things are not clear thus far, and we cannot really communicate on that very matter. So far, as we can see with the Lumia 930, the Nokia brand has been kept alive, as it is still featured on the device. But where do we go from here is still not final yet.</p>
<ul><li><em>Talking about the Lumia 930, do you really feel that it is a true flagship device? Meaning, is it up to par with all currently available competing flagship devices out there? Does it lack something others currently have?</em></li>
</ul><p>What can I say? It has an awesome design by all means, it’s light, it’s powerful, it’s equipped with the latest chipset currently available, a monster camera, and a plethora of apps, including all major apps users would look for. Even the OS got way better with WP 8.1, as it can perform practically all stunts and tricks other platforms do and more. Wouldn’t you call it a true flagship?</p>
<ul><li><em>It is indeed a flagship in many ways. But don’t you feel you need to be more aggressive on the pricing if you want to penetrate the market and convert people from Android or iOS to Windows Phone?</em></li>
</ul><p>You’re right. This is where the Lumia 630/635 comes in. These devices offer premium features and specs in a totally sexy and extremely affordable package. This is how we want people to convert to Windows Phone; by offering them a complete and affordable way in.</p>

<p>A UAE space agency will be created to oversee the UAE’s space programme sector and to supervise the missions. The announcement makes the UAE one of nine countries with space programmes to explore Mars. The probe’s 60 million kilometer journey will be taking nine month to complete.</p>

					<div><p>CUPERTINO, Calif. & ARMONK, N.Y.–(<a href="http://www.businesswire.com/" rel="nofollow">BUSINESS WIRE</a>)–Apple® and IBM (NYSE: <a href="http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ibm.com%2Finvestor&esheet=50905160&newsitemid=20140715006655&lan=en-US&anchor=IBM&index=1&md5=0b703f2b62589227d451e96b50f78dd5" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">IBM</a>) today announced an exclusive partnership that teams the market-leading strengths of each company to transform enterprise mobility through a new class of business apps—bringing IBM’s big data and analytics capabilities to iPhone® and iPad®.</p>
<p> </p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Mobility—combined with the phenomena of data and cloud—is transforming business and our industry in historic ways, allowing people to re-imagine work, industries and professions”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The landmark partnership aims to redefine the way work will get done, address key industry mobility challenges and spark true mobile-led business change—grounded in four core capabilities:</p>
<p>• a new class of more than 100 industry-specific enterprise solutions including native apps, developed exclusively from the ground up, for iPhone and iPad;</p>
<p>• unique IBM cloud services optimized for iOS, including device management, security, analytics and mobile integration;</p>
<p>• new AppleCare® service and support offering tailored to the needs of the enterprise; and</p>
<p>• new packaged offerings from IBM for device activation, supply and management.</p>
<p>The new IBM MobileFirst for iOS solutions will be built in an exclusive collaboration that draws on the distinct strengths of each company: IBM’s big data and analytics capabilities, with the power of more than 100,000 IBM industry and domain consultants and software developers behind it, fused with Apple’s legendary consumer experience, hardware and software integration and developer platform. The combination will create apps that can transform specific aspects of how businesses and employees work using iPhone and iPad, allowing companies to achieve new levels of efficiency, effectiveness and customer satisfaction—faster and easier than ever before.</p>
<p>As part of the exclusive IBM MobileFirst for iOS agreement, IBM will also sell iPhones and iPads with the industry-specific solutions to business clients worldwide.</p>
<p>“iPhone and iPad are the best mobile devices in the world and have transformed the way people work with over 98 percent of the Fortune 500 and over 92 percent of the Global 500 using iOS devices in their business today,” said Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO. “For the first time ever we’re putting IBM’s renowned big data analytics at iOS users’ fingertips, which opens up a large market opportunity for Apple. This is a radical step for enterprise and something that only Apple and IBM can deliver.”</p>
<p>“Mobility—combined with the phenomena of data and cloud—is transforming business and our industry in historic ways, allowing people to re-imagine work, industries and professions,” said Ginni Rometty, IBM Chairman, President and CEO. “This alliance with Apple will build on our momentum in bringing these innovations to our clients globally, and leverages IBM’s leadership in analytics, cloud, software and services. We are delighted to be teaming with Apple, whose innovations have transformed our lives in ways we take for granted, but can’t imagine living without. Our alliance will bring the same kind of transformation to the way people work, industries operate and companies perform.”</p>
<p>Apple and IBM’s shared vision for this partnership is to put in the hands of business professionals everywhere the unique capabilities of iPads and iPhones with a company’s knowledge, data, analytics and workflows. Specifically, the two companies are working together to deliver the essential elements of enterprise mobile solutions:</p>
<p>- Mobile solutions that transform business: The companies will collaborate to build IBM MobileFirst for iOS Solutions—a new class of “made-for-business apps” targeting specific industry issues or opportunities in retail, healthcare, banking, travel and transportation, telecommunications and insurance, among others, that will become available starting this fall and into 2015.</p>
<p>- Mobile platform: The IBM MobileFirst Platform for iOS will deliver the services required for an end-to-end enterprise capability, from analytics, workflow and cloud storage, to fleet-scale device management, security and integration. Enhanced mobile management includes a private app catalog, data and transaction security services, and productivity suite for all IBM MobileFirst for iOS solutions. In addition to on-premise software solutions, all these services will be available on Bluemix—IBM’s development platform on the IBM Cloud Marketplace.</p>
<p>- Mobile service and support: AppleCare for Enterprise will provide IT departments and end users with 24/7 assistance from Apple’s award-winning customer support group, with on-site service delivered by IBM.</p>
<p>- Packaged service offerings: IBM is introducing IBM MobileFirst Supply and Management for device supply, activation and management services for iPhone and iPad, with leasing options.</p>
<p>Announced at Apple’s Worldwide Developer Conference in June and available later this year, Apple’s iOS 8 is the biggest release since the launch of the App Store℠, giving users incredible new features and developers the tools to create amazing new apps. For enterprise, iOS 8 builds on the new IT model for a mobilized workforce by improving the way users are informed of how their devices are configured, managed or restricted, with expanded security, management and productivity features.</p>
<p>Apple designs Macs, along with OS X, iLife, iWork and professional software. Apple leads the digital music revolution with its iPods and iTunes online store. Apple has reinvented the mobile phone with its revolutionary iPhone and App Store, and is defining the future of mobile media and computing devices with iPad.</p>
<p>IBM’s 5,000 mobile experts have been at the forefront of mobile enterprise innovation. IBM has secured more than 4,300 patents in mobile, social and security, that have been incorporated into IBM MobileFirst solutions that enable enterprise clients to radically streamline and accelerate mobile adoption, help organizations engage more people and capture new markets.</p>
<p>IBM has made a dozen acquisitions in security in the past decade, has more than 6,000 security researchers and developers in its 25 security labs worldwide that work on developing enterprise-class solutions.</p>
<p>IBM has also established the world’s deepest portfolio in Big Data and Analytics consulting and technology expertise based on experiences drawn from more than 40,000 data and analytics client engagements. This analytics portfolio spans research and development, solutions, software and hardware, and includes more than 15,000 analytics consultants, 4,000 analytics patents, 6,000 industry solution business partners, and 400 IBM mathematicians who are helping clients use big data to transform their organizations.</p></div>
