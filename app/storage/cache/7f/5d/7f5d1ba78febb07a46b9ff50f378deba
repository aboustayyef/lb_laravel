I try reading on various devices but I always prefer the physicals once. I love books and I don't think I can ever read a whole book on a screen, no matter what size. I love printed magazines, I love the content, design, look and it is a pleasure flipping through it. I think books or magazines just feel like the right format for reading a large amount of content. When it comes to news or shorter articles, I love what the internet have to offer, I visit news/blogs sites daily on both my computer and I pad.<br>I doubt print will die but it will need to evolve. Magazines need to engage more, they can use digital platforms to do so.<br><div><br></div><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/blogspot/BPqar/~4/nKqEZ1hQ2xQ" height="1" width="1">";s:17:"post_image_height";i:1600;s:16:"post_image_width";i:1342;s:11:"post_visits";i:5;s:18:"post_twitterShares";i:1;s:19:"post_facebookShares";i:2;s:16:"post_totalShares";i:3;s:16:"post_socialScore";i:10;s:13:"post_virality";i:9;s:9:"blog_name";s:9:"Joe's Box";s:16:"blog_description";s:25:"Have a look inside my box";s:8:"blog_url";s:18:"http://joesbox.com";s:11:"blog_author";s:12:"Youssef Alam";s:28:"blog_author_twitter_username";s:7:"JoesBox";s:13:"blog_rss_feed";s:42:"http://www.joesbox.com/feeds/posts/default";s:9:"blog_tags";s:21:"society, tech, design";s:2:"id";i:61;s:11:"blog_active";i:1;s:24:"blog_last_post_timestamp";i:1401708180;}i:1;O:8:"stdClass":26:{s:7:"post_id";i:28920;s:8:"post_url";s:53:"http://www.joesbox.com/2014/05/online-generation.html";s:10:"post_title";s:24:"“Online” generation!";s:10:"post_image";s:43:"http://img.youtube.com/vi/Z7dLU6fk9QY/0.jpg";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:0:"";s:7:"blog_id";s:7:"joesbox";s:14:"post_timestamp";i:1399221360;s:12:"post_content";s:218:"<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="415" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/Z7dLU6fk9QY?rel=0" width="650"></iframe><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/blogspot/BPqar/~4/WPYm64iqL0w" height="1" width="1">";s:17:"post_image_height";i:360;s:16:"post_image_width";i:480;s:11:"post_visits";i:12;s:18:"post_twitterShares";i:2;s:19:"post_facebookShares";i:1;s:16:"post_totalShares";i:3;s:16:"post_socialScore";i:17;s:13:"post_virality";i:9;s:9:"blog_name";s:9:"Joe's Box";s:16:"blog_description";s:25:"Have a look inside my box";s:8:"blog_url";s:18:"http://joesbox.com";s:11:"blog_author";s:12:"Youssef Alam";s:28:"blog_author_twitter_username";s:7:"JoesBox";s:13:"blog_rss_feed";s:42:"http://www.joesbox.com/feeds/posts/default";s:9:"blog_tags";s:21:"society, tech, design";s:2:"id";i:61;s:11:"blog_active";i:1;s:24:"blog_last_post_timestamp";i:1401708180;}i:2;O:8:"stdClass":26:{s:7:"post_id";i:28911;s:8:"post_url";s:74:"http://www.absolutegeeks.com/2014/05/huawei-smartphones-launch-in-lebanon/";s:10:"post_title";s:36:"Huawei Smartphones launch In Lebanon";s:10:"post_image";s:89:"http://www.absolutegeeks.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Huawei_phone_display-1024x576.jpg";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:123:"It was roughly 9 days ago when I received an invitation to attend an event by HUAWEI in the prestigious Le Royal, Dbay...";s:7:"blog_id";s:13:"absolutegeeks";s:14:"post_timestamp";i:1399193580;s:12:"post_content";s:4309:"<p><span>It was roughly 9 days ago when I received an invitation to attend an event by </span><a href="http://consumer.huawei.com/en/mobile-phones/" target="_blank"><b>HUAWEI</b> </a><span>in the prestigious Le Royal, Dbayeh. </span></p>
<p><span>The Chinese Telecom giant was making its debut in Lebanon as a major player in the smartphone business. My previous encounters with a Huawei handset had been very brief as I only got to check out the device once with one of my friends who is living in Dubai. I did not have enough to build an opinion and this event was an occasion to familiarize myself with this manufacturer.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.absolutegeeks.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Huawei_phone_display.jpg" rel="lightbox-0"><img src="http://www.absolutegeeks.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Huawei_phone_display-1024x576.jpg" alt="Huawei_phone_display" width="838" height="471"></a></p>
<p><span>Fast forward to the event day, I arrived slightly ahead of time to the event and this actually gave me plenty of time to really poke around with the models that were on display. A wide collection was exposed and while it was easy to tell the low-end devices from the high-end ones, they all seemed quite responsive when submitted to the casual tests one can perform in such a short window. Another nice surprise was that all ran Android 4.4.2. this made me move past the aesthetics for some devices and the resemblance with other manufacturers. My immediate crush was for the</span><b> <a href="http://consumer.huawei.com/en/mobile-phones/features/p6-u06-en.htm" target="_blank">Ascend P6</a></b><span>. This device was thin, ultra light and really a pleasure to handle but more on this later and in a subsequent post.</span></p>
<p><span>The formal presentation was, well, formal…the usual intros by the mother company but also by </span><b>Mr Eddie Cherfane</b><span> (you might know the name from another brand of phones) who is heading </span><a href="http://www.chetracolb.com/" target="_blank"><b>CHETRACO</b></a><span> the local partner for the Chinese brand.</span><br><span>I must admit some of the info presented was new to me and quite impressive: 3rd biggest smartphone manufacturer worldwide, P6 the slimmest smartphone ever made, the brand managed to climb from 25% to 52% in terms of awareness….</span></p>
<p><span>Huawei seem very confident of their UI dubbed </span><b>“<a href="http://en.ui.vmall.com/intro.html" target="_blank">Emotion UI</a>“</b><span> but also of the fact that they can take-on older better known and well anchored names in the smartphone industry. From what I have seen they might just be able to to pull this off. I must admit that I was slightly disappointed when they replied to a question I raised that there would not be any “Google Play Edition” of their phones in the Lebanese market. The vanilla Android experience for me is somehow always more enjoyable than any added layer but that’s probably my hardcore coding side talking: </span><i>You can take a man out of coding, but you can’t take coding out of a man.</i><br><br><span>While, during the presentation, we got to see the list of phones that are now available in the Lebanese market alongside what is planned next, the highlight of the event was when I managed to have a casual chat with</span><b> Mr Ashraf Fawakherji</b><span>, </span><i>Vice President Open Market Middle East Region</i><span>, who was very informative on their vision and strategy but above all was extremely nice to let me have a sneak peak at the P6′s successor the </span><a href="http://www.gizbot.com/mobile/huawei-ascend-p7-new-press-images-spotted-online-017000.html" target="_blank"><b>Ascend P7</b></a><span>. I tell you people, these guys have done a lot to surpass their previous model and they mean business!</span><br><br><span>We also got treated to an unexpected surprise as we all walked away with the Huawei Ascend P6.</span><br><span>I will be reviewing the device in the next few days so you might want to stay tuned for that.</span></p>

Allegations reached a peak last summer over one particular incident, when the US said a "red line" had been crossed in Syria and there was a strong possibility of a US-led military intervention. </span><br><span>At the last hour, Russia pushed through a compromise, that Syria would willingly hand over its chemical weapons to the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) for destruction. Military intervention was called off. A self-imposed deadline by Syria to hand over all chemical weapons was set for April 27 this year, and the weapons to be destroyed by June 30. </span><br><span>As of April 22, 86.5 percent of weapons had been handed over. By April 24, 92.5 percent had been relinquished, according to the OPCW. This is extraordinary progress considering the obstacles faced, including extracting and transporting the weapons in the mid of a conflict, and getting them to US navy vessel </span><em>Cape Ray</em><span> to be taken from Syrian shores for destruction. </span><br><span>Indicative of the complexities is that, according to an AFP report, the last chemical weapon stockpile is near the Syrian capital but cannot be accessed for security reasons. It is no surprise then that Damascus did not meet April 27's deadline, which is a concern, but it was perhaps wishful thinking for the deadline to be met in a relatively short time frame. </span><br><span>Moreover, with the removal of chemical stockpiles still underway, it gives Damascus more time to stave off international pressure, particularly as UN Security Council members are calling for a new investigation into alleged gas attacks.</span><br><span>Yet while recriminations and fingers are being pointed at Damascus for having missed the deadline, Syria's actions since last summer are worthy of emulation. </span><br><span>Indeed, the removal of the chemical weapons is one of the few positive developments since the conflict started in 2011. </span><br><span>The removal of weapons in trying circumstances is a further positive sign, and one that should send a signal to other countries possessing chemical weapons to get rid of them too. </span><br><span>Syria's example means there is no excuse for some countries not to sign up to the 1993 Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC). </span><br><span>More crucially, given the US wagging its finger at Syria over chemical weapons, and Russia having suggested disarmament in the first place, the two countries should re-bolster their efforts to eradicate their own stockpiles. </span><br><span>The US in particular sounds hypocritical when it forces Syria to disarm, and given the sordid saga of Iraq's alleged weapons of mass destruction that provided the casus belli for the US invasion of Iraq in 2003. </span><br><span>Furthermore, Iraq signed the CWC in 2009, and has a supply of chemical weapons from before the 1991 Gulf War, yet the US did not destroy these caches when occupying the country, or in the years since. </span><br><span>The big issue is that under the CWC, participating countries were given a decade to destroy stockpiles, with the possibility of a five year extension. By 2007, five countries had missed the deadline: the US, Russia, South Korea, India and Albania. In the years since, South Korea, Albania and India have lived up to their obligations. </span><br><span>While 58,528 metric tons (MT), or 80.69 percent, of the world's declared stockpile of 72,531 MT of chemical agents have been destroyed, according to the OPCW, Russia and the US missed a second deadline, the supposed final one, in 2012. To date, Russia still has some 15,000 MT (38 percent of former stockpiles), and the US has some 2,800 MT (10 percent). </span><br><span>Russia is slated to have destroyed its stockpile by 2015, although there are doubts this will happen before 2020. The US on the other hand is only likely to have destroyed its weapons by late 2023. </span><br><span>We are approaching 100 years since chlorine gas was first used in modern warfare, in 1915, which left over 90,000 dead and 1 million injured. This should give further impetus to eradicating such horrific weapons. </span>";s:17:"post_image_height";i:0;s:16:"post_image_width";i:0;s:11:"post_visits";i:4;s:18:"post_twitterShares";i:0;s:19:"post_facebookShares";i:0;s:16:"post_totalShares";i:0;s:16:"post_socialScore";i:5;s:13:"post_virality";i:2;s:9:"blog_name";s:14:"Back in Beirut";s:16:"blog_description";s:67:"Articles and snapshots: Lebanon, the Middle East and further afield";s:8:"blog_url";s:33:"http://backinbeirut.blogspot.com/";s:11:"blog_author";s:13:"Paul Cochrane";s:28:"blog_author_twitter_username";N;s:13:"blog_rss_feed";s:52:"http://backinbeirut.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default";s:9:"blog_tags";s:14:"tech, business";s:2:"id";i:9;s:11:"blog_active";i:1;s:24:"blog_last_post_timestamp";i:1399376460;}i:4;O:8:"stdClass":26:{s:7:"post_id";i:28901;s:8:"post_url";s:65:"http://tech-ticker.com/roundup-security-week-26-april-3-may-2014/";s:10:"post_title";s:51:"Roundup: Security in a Week – 26 April/3 May 2014";s:10:"post_image";s:45:"http://i.vimeocdn.com/video/455737302_640.jpg";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:123:"Security in a week is a series of articles that is posted each week covering between 10 to 20 security news headlines fr...";s:7:"blog_id";s:11:"tech-ticker";s:14:"post_timestamp";i:1399158060;s:12:"post_content";s:10125:"<p>Security in a week is a series of articles that is posted each week covering between 10 to 20 security news headlines from around the globe.</p>
<p>Have you ever wished to check all security news websites to only find that there’s a lot of reading to do and most of the articles are useless for you? Well we will do that for you, doing our best to pick up the most interesting and important bits.</p>
<p>Note: I will number the news randomly and not by order of importance.

<h3>Passwords Patterns Collected recently</h3>
<p>Kevin Liston, an ISC holder, recently had the chance to collect passwords from compromised machine. And those are some of the pattern he found:</p>
<ul><li>Some uses a slightly modified version of the word “password”, example: Pa55W0rd.</li>
<li>Some uses their name or the website name followed by a number (most of the time it is the number one or sequential number), example: JeanPierre123 or TechTicker1.</li>
</ul><p>This shows that brute forcing credentials is still profitable and that users lacks some good security knowledge. Also the problem is that a huge number of users uses those same patterns. As a user, you should avoid using these quick, throwaway passwords. As a website owner, you should not allow passwords ending in 1 or 123, that’s a pretty simple filter to implement. As a network owner, you should be brute forcing your own access credentials using a short hit-list. As an ISC Handler, you should practice what you preach.</p>

<h3>IE Patch Update</h3>
<p>Microsoft released a special update on 1/5/2014 fixing the Internet Explorer vulnerability which has been used in targeted attacks recently affecting all IE iterations back to version 6. Even if you don’t use IE as your main browser, it may still launch in some cases, and unless you don’t use a Microsoft operating system you are still considered vulnerable. Make sure to update your Windows OS people.</p>

<h3>Authy makes two steps verification easy</h3>
<p>Security must be your utmost priority when it comes to your online account. We use password to protect our accounts, but nowadays, this is not enough. You need two-step verification, which means once you enter your password, you will receive an sms message on your phone giving you a code or token that enables you to access your account. Most of us find this practice time consuming, but a few extra seconds may save you from months of headache later on.</p>
<p>Authy is the software you need, what it does is simplify this process for you. Authy supports multiple platforms, and it also supports providing two-step tokens for multiple online services like Gmail, Dropbox, and Facebook to name just a few. Perhaps the best part of Authy is the fact you can sync your account across multiple devices, meaning no matter what device you find yourself using, you’ll have quick access to your tokens.</p>
<p>In addition to that, if you’re on a computer, you no longer have to wait for a text or take your phone out of your bag just to get the token. Simply launch the app, enter your Authy password and copy the token.</p>
<p>Download the app from: <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/~https://www.authy.com/" target="_blank">https://www.authy.com/</a> and then follow the detailed steps provided with the app.</p>

<h3>Some security flaws are kept secret, reveals the NSA</h3>
<p>The NSA lately disclosed that some security flaws that they know about, are sometimes kept secret from the people. In a blog post, White House cybersecurity coordinator Michael Daniel detailed when the NSA keeps security vulnerabilities under wraps and when it lets the public know they exist.</p>

<h3>2 Findings From Akamai’s 4Q13 State of the Internet Report</h3>
<p>The internet is in constant development, and one of the ways that the internet evolution is tracked is by the way of Akamai quarterly state of the internet report (7 findings are presented in the report). I will illustrate the 2 findings related to security in this quarter:</p>
<ol><li>Most of the internet attacks are orginated from China (43% of the attacks) followed by the Snited States in the second place with 19% of the attacks generated from there.</li>
<li>Port 445 Is the Most Attacked Port: Microsoft Directory Services (DS), which sits on Port 445, was once again the single most attacked network service. Port 445 Microsoft DS attacks represented 30 percent of attack volume in the fourth quarter, up from 23 percent in the third quarter of 2013. Followed by port 80 (www and http port) with 14% of attack volume hitting it.</li>

<h3>Facebook servers can be used for huge DDOS of attack</h3>
<p>Distributed Denial Of Service attacks are increasing lately and the attackers are not short of new sophisticated and advanced way. A new way is to use Facebook ‘Notes’ as a mechanism to trigger DDoS attack using the image <strong><img></strong> tag according to Chaman Thapa, known as ‘chr13’ who wrote in a blog recently. You can check the blog post <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/~chr13.com/2014/04/20/using-facebook-notes-to-ddos-any-website/" target="_blank">here</a> for more information</p>

<h3>500 password u should never use</h3>
<p>Here is a list of 500 easily hackable and widely used passwords that you should never use. This list is put by the people at hackersnewsbulletin so feel free to check it <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/~hackersnewsbulletin.com/2014/04/major-list-500-passwords-easily-hackable-use.html" target="_blank">here.</a></p>
<h3>Hacker condemned for 440 years of jails</h3>
<p>440 years of jail is pretty absurd but when you are accused of 44 charges you can’t really expect less!</p>
<p>27-year-old Fidel Salinas of Donna, Texas, was charged with several counts of cyber stalking, attempted computer hacking and with intent to harass and intimidate a female victim, making it altogether 44 counts of cyber assaults that could lead him up to 440 years in jail!</p>
<p>It looked like, Salinas would only face a single count of charge, but charges against him continue to be filed. Salinas is also an alleged member of the famous amorphous Hacktivist group Anonymous.</p>

<h3>Skype leaves sensitive user data unencrypted locally on a computer</h3>
<p>Skype chat, video, image and calls are all encrypted via Skype servers. But the local (the one that resides on your PC on your hard drive) Skype database has been found unencrypted and it can be accessed by anyone who have access to your PC. This databse may contain: full name, birth date, phone number, country, city and even full chat conversation.</p>
<p>A flaw in the popular voice calling and messaging service may have left its Millions of users vulnerable to the attackers by storing the data in such a way that anyone can read it. The users’ details are kept inside one of Skype’s database files buried within the file system, but anyone could see it if they had access to user’s device and knew where to look.</p>
<p>It is quite easy to steal the history files and with the help of some special software one can view all the history without your Skype password.
<br>

The Chinese Telecom giant was making its debut in Lebanon as a major player in the smartphone business. My previous encounters with a Huawei handset had been very brief as I only got to check out the device once with one of my friends who is living in Dubai. I did not have enough to build an opinion and this event was an occasion to familiarize myself with this manufacturer.<br><br><div><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-jFO2G7RGw0Y/U2VhGvb1BHI/AAAAAAAAGug/b_IHIqB4GWs/s1600/Huawei_phone_display.jpg" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-jFO2G7RGw0Y/U2VhGvb1BHI/AAAAAAAAGug/b_IHIqB4GWs/s1600/Huawei_phone_display.jpg" height="225" width="400"></a></div><br><br>Fast forward to the event day, I arrived slightly ahead of time to the event and this actually gave me plenty of time to really poke around with the models that were on display. A wide collection was exposed and while it was easy to tell the low-end devices from the high-end ones, they all seemed quite responsive when submitted to the casual tests one can perform in such a short window. Another nice surprise was that all ran Android 4.4.2. this made me move past the aesthetics for some devices and the resemblance with other manufacturers. My immediate crush was for the<b> <a href="http://consumer.huawei.com/en/mobile-phones/features/p6-u06-en.htm" target="_blank">Ascend P6</a></b>. This device was thin, ultra light and really a pleasure to handle but more on this later and in a subsequent post.<br><br>The formal presentation was, well, formal...the usual intros by the mother company but also by Mr Eddie Cherfane (you might know the name from another brand of phones) who is heading <a href="http://www.chetracolb.com/" target="_blank"><b>CHETRACO</b></a> the local partner for the Chinese brand.<br>I must admit some of the info presented was new to me and quite impressive: 3rd biggest smartphone manufacturer worldwide, P6 the slimmest smartphone ever made, the brand managed to climb from 25% to 52% in terms of awareness....<br>Huawei seem very confident of their UI dubbed "<a href="http://en.ui.vmall.com/intro.html" target="_blank">Emotion UI</a>" but also of the fact that they can take-on older better known and well anchored names in the smartphone industry. From what I have seen they might just be able to to pull this off. I must admit that I was slightly disappointed when they replied to a question I raised that there would not be any "Google Play Edition" of their phones in the Lebanese market. The vanilla Android experience for me is somehow always more enjoyable than any added layer but that's probably my hardcore coding side talking: <i>You can take a man out of coding, but you can't take coding out of a man.</i><br><br>While, during the presentation, we got to see the list of phones that are now available in the Lebanese market alongside what is planned next, the highlight of the event was when I managed to have a casual chat with<b> Mr Ashraf Fawakherji</b>, <i>Vice President Open Market Middle East Region</i>, who was very informative on their vision and strategy but above all was extremely nice to let me have a sneak peak at the P6's successor the <a href="http://www.gizbot.com/mobile/huawei-ascend-p7-new-press-images-spotted-online-017000.html" target="_blank">Ascend P7</a>. I tell you people, these guys have done a lot to surpass their previous model and they mean business!<br><br>We also got treated to an unexpected surprise as we all walked away with the Huawei Ascend P6.<br>I will be reviewing the device in the next few days so you might want to stay tuned for that.<br>I leave you with some pictures from the event and of the devices.<br><br><div><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-J5Vst5QDiCw/U2VhYCtRH5I/AAAAAAAAGuw/d3R63f-vpdw/s1600/IMG_20140502_125504+(Medium).JPG" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-J5Vst5QDiCw/U2VhYCtRH5I/AAAAAAAAGuw/d3R63f-vpdw/s1600/IMG_20140502_125504+(Medium).JPG" height="157" width="200"></a><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-_UnWyvm0fnQ/U2VhiXdwNqI/AAAAAAAAGu4/EdCHAAg-Zgc/s1600/IMG_20140502_123440+(Medium).jpg" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-_UnWyvm0fnQ/U2VhiXdwNqI/AAAAAAAAGu4/EdCHAAg-Zgc/s1600/IMG_20140502_123440+(Medium).jpg" height="200" width="112"></a><a href="https://images-blogger-opensocial.googleusercontent.com/gadgets/proxy?url=http%3A%2F%2F4.bp.blogspot.com%2F-IdZQciD2RO8%2FU2VhQj-IkKI%2FAAAAAAAAGuo%2FuRt5Nvyje30%2Fs1600%2FPANO_20140502_123313%2B(Medium).jpg&container=blogger&gadget=a&rewriteMime=image%2F*" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-IdZQciD2RO8/U2VhQj-IkKI/AAAAAAAAGuo/uRt5Nvyje30/s1600/PANO_20140502_123313+(Medium).jpg" height="133" width="200"></a></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-8rGk8BeW_X0/U2VomCzpPTI/AAAAAAAAGvI/P8v0xJ8wlPU/s1600/huawei_devices.jpg" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-8rGk8BeW_X0/U2VomCzpPTI/AAAAAAAAGvI/P8v0xJ8wlPU/s1600/huawei_devices.jpg" height="480" width="640"></a></div><div><br></div><div><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-dcl4atqGAgc/U2VqR45IQ0I/AAAAAAAAGvU/eOjGgLo71GY/s1600/Huawei-english-PR1.png" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-dcl4atqGAgc/U2VqR45IQ0I/AAAAAAAAGvU/eOjGgLo71GY/s1600/Huawei-english-PR1.png"></a></div><br><div><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-jNxauinAWUE/U2VqSJ4dcLI/AAAAAAAAGvc/GuB8k1z9YY8/s1600/Huawei-english-PR2.png" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-jNxauinAWUE/U2VqSJ4dcLI/AAAAAAAAGvc/GuB8k1z9YY8/s1600/Huawei-english-PR2.png"></a></div><br><div><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-a52wSsAreH8/U2VqSEtrVrI/AAAAAAAAGvY/sVME4zlpVOU/s1600/Huawei-english-PR3.png" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-a52wSsAreH8/U2VqSEtrVrI/AAAAAAAAGvY/sVME4zlpVOU/s1600/Huawei-english-PR3.png"></a></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><br></div>";s:17:"post_image_height";i:768;s:16:"post_image_width";i:1364;s:11:"post_visits";i:5;s:18:"post_twitterShares";i:7;s:19:"post_facebookShares";i:5;s:16:"post_totalShares";i:12;s:16:"post_socialScore";i:15;s:13:"post_virality";i:20;s:9:"blog_name";s:31:"@Face Value, by Patrick Chemali";s:16:"blog_description";s:109:"If that's how I said it happened, then most probably that's how it happened...well, in my opinion at least...";s:8:"blog_url";s:24:"http://blog.chemali.org/";s:11:"blog_author";s:15:"Patrick Chemali";s:28:"blog_author_twitter_username";s:7:"chemali";s:13:"blog_rss_feed";s:51:"http://blog.chemali.org/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss";s:9:"blog_tags";s:21:"society, tech, design";s:2:"id";i:270;s:11:"blog_active";i:1;s:24:"blog_last_post_timestamp";i:1401745680;}i:6;O:8:"stdClass":26:{s:7:"post_id";i:28884;s:8:"post_url";s:175:"http://www.smex.org/whos-been-detained-in-lebanon-for-freedom-of-speech/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=whos-been-detained-in-lebanon-for-freedom-of-speech";s:10:"post_title";s:55:"Who’s been detained for freedom of speech in Lebanon?";s:10:"post_image";s:68:"http://www.smex.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Freedom-of-Speech.png";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:123:"Photo credit: www.sha3teely.com

But it’s very useful and I don’t think I’m hurting <em>Annahar</em> in anyway when I share this. So here goes.</p>
<p>I like reading my news on the iPad each morning, and I’m not really a fan of <em>Annahar’s</em> iPad edition, which for all intents and purposes has become <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abandonware">abandonware</a>; I also love the Layout of <em>Annahar</em> and I think <a href="http://www.linotype.com/5282/nadinechahine.html">Nadine</a> has done <a href="http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20110411007222/en/Customized-Typeface-Lebanon%E2%80%99s-An-Nahar-Newspaper-Debuts-Redesign#.U2T7761_urY">tremendous work</a> with the fonts.</p>
<p>All this is to say that I want a way to see <em>Annahar</em> in all its layout and typography glory on my iPad. But the <a href="http://newspaper.annahar.com/pdf">official way</a> of browsing the pdf in <em>Annahar’s</em> website is very lacking on the iPad, which still is not friendly to embedded PDFs in iframes. So I wrote a little script that will just load the pdf file of the latest edition of the newspaper and fill the entire iPad screen. See the difference: </p>

After al...";s:7:"blog_id";s:13:"absolutegeeks";s:14:"post_timestamp";i:1399041600;s:12:"post_content";s:9911:"<p>When the first HTC One made its debut, it was hard to imagine how HTC would do a better job with its successor. After all, the M7 had a lot going on for it: outstanding design; innovative, beautifully loud speakers; elegant UI; BlinkFeed; and the Ultrapixel camera – the latter two features being fodder to plenty of love/hate debate. But regardless, it was a unique phone in every dimension possible.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.absolutegeeks.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/DSCN0008.jpg" rel="lightbox-0"><img src="http://www.absolutegeeks.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/DSCN0008-1024x768.jpg" alt="HTC One M8 – AbsoluteGeeks" width="838" height="628"></a></p>
<p>The M8 builds on the foundation set by the M7 and refines many of its features and shortcomings in both hardware and software. The best comparison I can give between the M7 and M8 is an iPhone 5 running iOS 6 and an iPhone 5S running iOS7.</p>
<p>That is not to say that this incremental update should be overlooked. The improvements are noticeable enough – especially from the software’s side – that the M8 feels and functions as a worthwhile upgrade.</p>
<h2>The Hardware</h2>
<p>No matter what I say and write as an attempt to explain the hardware, the only way to understand and appreciate how wonderful and natural the phone is is by holding it. Photos are not enough.</p>

<a href="http://www.absolutegeeks.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/DSCN0001.jpg" rel="lightbox[gallery-1]"><img width="150" height="150" src="http://www.absolutegeeks.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/DSCN0001-150x150.jpg" alt="HTC One M8 – AbsoluteGeeks"></a>
<a href="http://www.absolutegeeks.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/DSCN0004.jpg" rel="lightbox[gallery-1]"><img width="150" height="150" src="http://www.absolutegeeks.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/DSCN0004-150x150.jpg" alt="HTC One M8 – AbsoluteGeeks"></a>
<a href="http://www.absolutegeeks.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/DSCN0007.jpg" rel="lightbox[gallery-1]"><img width="150" height="150" src="http://www.absolutegeeks.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/DSCN0007-150x150.jpg" alt="HTC One M8 – AbsoluteGeeks"></a>

<p> </p>
<p>But I’ll try anyway. The entirety of the phone is a unibody metallic case, with the only non-metal components being the screen, the power button, and the IR blaster. The phone has stronger curves than the M7 and fits comfortable in the hand. The metal wraps around the sides as well before folding underneath the screen; there is definitely no harsh or hard edge to be felt.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.absolutegeeks.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/DSCN0006.jpg" rel="lightbox-1"><img src="http://www.absolutegeeks.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/DSCN0006-1024x768.jpg" alt="HTC One M8 – AbsoluteGeeks" width="838" height="628"></a></p>
<p>The speakers remain prominent and they are as loud as ever, though they’re a bit soft on the bass. But make no mistake: this is one of the best phones to watch a movie on or listen to music from. Speaking of watching movies, the screen is downright gorgeous. The colours are beautiful and faithful, with the whites more white (or rather, slightly cooler) than the Nexus 5. Colours in pictures, movies, and apps look really well.</p>
<p>My only gripe with the design is the power button sitting on top. For a phone this size, it makes more sense to have it on either side. Thankfully, HTC probably thought about that and implemented a gesture function in the software that allows you to unlock through a double-tap or swipe on the screen.</p>
<h2>The Software</h2>
<p>Sense UI has been updated, and is as elegant as ever. Custom UI by manufacturers is a personal taste, and not many people are into Sense UI.</p>
<p>The update has refreshed the overall look aligning with the current trend of flat design. It’s the closest UI that resembles stock android, and most apps appear as refined from stock rather than a complete overhaul. The mail app in particular is a delight to use, with different accounts having shades of blue, red, and magenta to my liking.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.absolutegeeks.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/calendar.jpg" rel="lightbox-2"><img src="http://www.absolutegeeks.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/calendar-1024x888.jpg" alt="HTC One M8 Calendar – AbsoluteGeeks" width="838" height="726"></a></p>
<p>The overall colour theme of the phone and accents can also be changed in the theme menu, though you’re limited to four presets, one of which is monotone greys and blacks for your formal look, or if the blues, greens, oranges, purples, and reds are too colourful to your taste. What’s missing though is a custom theme builder feature, which I’d like to see in the next update or the next phone.</p>
<p>Battery performance has been greatly improved as well with the new software update, easily giving the phone a full day’s worth of juice. There is an extreme saving mode as well which you can switch on that kills all functions except the most basic phone and SMS.</p>
<h2>Camera</h2>
<p>The camera is mostly unchanged from the last model, still touting the Ultrapixel technology for better or worse. In my experience though, the camera remains a hit and miss and needs more fiddling to get a good photo than other phone cameras can. The pictures are softer than those taken with other cameras, but the biggest problem is exposure. The Ultrapixels are designed to be hungry for light and this is problematic in indoor situations with various lighting or some outdoor photos in daylight. The camera struggles to get everything correctly exposed, and lamps and other light sources just flare up completely. That is not to say that it <em>always</em> takes bad photos, or that it struggles, but the frequency at which is does is noticeable.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>To overcome this glaring problem, full manual control of the camera options is given, where you can change ISO, focus, and shutter speed – which is great for deliberate photography but impractical for on-the-go shots.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.absolutegeeks.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/2014-04-29-16.47.41.png" rel="lightbox-3"><img src="http://www.absolutegeeks.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/2014-04-29-16.47.41-1024x576.png" alt="HTC M8 camera controls – AbsoluteGeeks" width="838" height="471"></a></p>
<p>The front-facing camera is better at handling light, and with the wide-angle lens, the selfies look better than ever, taking in a big chunk of the scene if you don’t mind the side-effect of having a ridiculously long arm. It sure is the highlight of all the camera features, making photos in gatherings and parties quite fun to shoot.</p>
<p>As for features, there are some really nifty ones thanks to the additional lens on the back of the phone. A fun one is the perspective shot which transforms any photo taken on default settings into a quasi-3D one. You can tilt the phone around and the perspective shifts to a degree, and is certainly a cool feature to have to wow your friends or to have fun and play around with.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.absolutegeeks.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/unfocus.jpg" rel="lightbox-4"><img src="http://www.absolutegeeks.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/unfocus-904x1024.jpg" alt="HTC M8 photos – AbsoluteGeeks" width="838" height="949"></a></p>
<p>The more useful feature though is the focus change (called unfocus) which gives you the ability to tap anywhere on the photo after it has been taken to change focus. How good this performs depends on the photo, but for the most part it pulls of some really good shots, especially for portraits.</p>
<h2>Final Words</h2>
<p>If there is ever a benchmark or blueprint for what a perfect android phone could be, it is the HTC One M8. The unmistakable design has pushed the envelope and it is by far the best looking android phone on the market, and one of the best looking phones in recent memory. The software is elegant and builds upon the stock android rather than rebuilds. The only downfall is its wild camera, which is unpredictable and requires some effort from your end to better compose to compensate for some erratic nuisance every now and then. It is not unusable but far from being the best camera on a phone.</p>";s:17:"post_image_height";i:768;s:16:"post_image_width";i:1024;s:11:"post_visits";i:12;s:18:"post_twitterShares";i:7;s:19:"post_facebookShares";i:46;s:16:"post_totalShares";i:53;s:16:"post_socialScore";i:28;s:13:"post_virality";i:32;s:9:"blog_name";s:14:"Absolute Geeks";s:16:"blog_description";s:28:"Unleash The Tech Geek In You";s:8:"blog_url";s:24:"http://absolutegeeks.com";s:11:"blog_author";s:0:"";s:28:"blog_author_twitter_username";s:13:"absolutegeeks";s:13:"blog_rss_feed";s:34:"http://www.absolutegeeks.com/feed/";s:9:"blog_tags";s:4:"tech";s:2:"id";i:268;s:11:"blog_active";i:1;s:24:"blog_last_post_timestamp";i:1401602040;}i:10;O:8:"stdClass":26:{s:7:"post_id";i:28817;s:8:"post_url";s:91:"http://www.taknologia.com/kevin-spacey-head-villain-new-call-duty-advanced-warfare-trailer/";s:10:"post_title";s:84:"Kevin spacey is the head villain in the new Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare (Trailer)";s:10:"post_image";s:43:"http://img.youtube.com/vi/sFu5qXMuaJU/0.jpg";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:123:"The next installment of the mega successful call of duty franchise will be dubbed Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare.

<p>Choosing the appropriate gift is one of the most difficult problems everyone faces. Cash gifts are surely the easiest and less time-wasting especially when no idea what to buy. Thus, the gift cards were founded to avoid gifting cash which may be misconstrued as if it is negligent or disrespectful.</p>
<p><a href="http://lfadi.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/011.jpg"><img src="http://lfadi.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/011.jpg?w=300&h=225" alt="01" width="300" height="225"></a></p>
<p> </p>
<p>However, buying a gift card needs time; furthermore it may limit the diversity of choice. Here from comes the idea of an eGift card, a gift card that can be bought online in few minutes to be used in 55+ stores like Virgin Megastore, Galerie Lafayette, Boutique 1, Faces, iStyle, etc.</p>
<p>What can be fluffier and prettier than receiving a message telling you got a gift?!</p>

<p> </p>
<p>The instant messaging “YouGotaGift” is the first online mall for gift cards in the Middle East. It was launched in UAE and extended to Lebanon recently.</p>
<p>Regardless of your current residence, you can now send an eGift Card to the one you care about living in Lebanon and he will be able to use it at any of the partners’ store. For the time being, YouGotaGift website is fairly adjusted for smartphones, awaiting the iPhone and Android applications that should be available within couple of weeks in addition to audio and video messaging tools.</p>
<p><a href="http://lfadi.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/23.png"><img src="http://lfadi.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/23.png?w=700" alt="2"></a></p>
<p> </p>
<p>You pick the eGift Card from the website by setting the amount, defining the occasion, selecting the design (a note and a photo can be added to the card) and choosing the delivery type (“Print at Home” for a printed hard copy of the card to be gifted and “Send it Digitally” for a soft copy to be sent via SMS, Email or Facebook):</p>
<p><img src="http://lfadi.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/43.png?w=700&h=235" alt="4" width="700" height="235"></p>
<p>Once done, you enter the payment details (Visa card, Master card or PayPal):</p>
<p><a href="http://lfadi.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/62.png"><img src="http://lfadi.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/5.png?w=700" alt="5"></a></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Moreover, YouGotaGift provide many services like “Group Gifting” and “Weddings”:</p>

<p> </p>
<p>As mentioned on the website, the purchase is instant, on time and secure. Once the purchase done, the message will be directly sent to the concerned person unless it is scheduled at a specific date and time. The card is usable since purchasing and for one year.</p>

<p>The move comes after careful investigation of how users engage with the app and the result of the endeavour to decrease app bloat. Swarm app – launching for iOS, android, and Windows Phone (at a later stage) – is your check-in and friend-finding app. It is aimed to be simple, fast, and efficient with a focused goal: find where your friends are and check in.</p>

<p>The Foursquare app itself will be re-invented to focus on discovery. Foursquare describes this as the digital Yellow Pages:</p>
<blockquote><p><span>Local search today is like the digital version of browsing through the Yellow Pages (remember those?). We believe local search should be personalized to your tastes and informed by the people you trust. The opinions of actual experts should matter, not just strangers.</span></p></blockquote>

<p>Today, April 30th, 2014 is the day I will officially mark as the day I stopped reading newspapers. It’s kind of a big deal for me, since I used to love spreading a broadsheet on a table with a coffee in hand and some nice jazz music playing softly in the background. But today is the day I found out I no longer wanted that.</p>
<p>You see, I did realize in the past few years that I was reading less and less newspapers and more and more online news or Kindle dailies, but I always assumed that it was out of pragmatic necessity, because I didn’t have access to an actual paper. But it turns out the transformation was more permanent.</p>
<p>Today, I was having breakfast at the hotel, and I saw them: A set of fresh, untouched, free newspapers silently pleading to me to pick them up and read while I’m having my morning coffee. These were not some second tier cheap newspapers. No, they were Lebanon’s top dailies: Annahar, the Daily Star..etc. This was a sight (and smell) that the old me would have drooled over, but today I felt nothing. </p>
<p>I hesitated for a moment, then looked at my iPhone, and it hit me: It’s officially the end of an era. I no longer want to read any news printed on paper…</p>

After the reported news about Google <a title="Google+ Nearly Reaching The End" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/~tech-ticker.com/google-nearly-reaching-end/" target="_blank">dropping Google+</a> to the backside bin, here comes rumors talking about the Android Silver project. <strong>‘</strong><a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/~https://www.theinformation.com/Google-Takes-Aim-iPhone-Silver-Program" target="_blank"><span><span><strong>The Information’</strong> reports</span></span></a> that the current Nexus-branded handset line sporting Google’s unadulterated vision of the best Android user experience will be trashed, to be replaced by a set of high-end Silver phones. Google is said to be planning to spend heavily on promoting these upcoming devices and subsidizing the development and marketing costs for its hardware partners, willing to spend as much as $1 billion to get phone makers to jump aboard the new initiative.</p>
<p>Why Android Silver? Google will potentially gain tighter control over the software shipping on the selected phones. The promise is that the company will clean up third-party bloatware, ensure prompt and reliable software updates, and introduce a real standard and consistency to the user experience across Android Silver devices.</p>
<p>These new devices will be introduced to every manufacturer’s lineup. But they will definitely need a lot of convincing to adhere to the project. Nevertheless, some of them already offer Google Play Editions of their flagship phones. But… thinking of it again, Google Play Edition is rather close enough to Android Silver…</p>
<p>It does look like Google wants to try and regain control of its mobile platform. Google is definitely shifting hard towards Android. A better Android. Making it an even stronger brand than what it is currently. But what is particularly peculiar about this rumored strategy is the fact that Google will kind of be letting the middle-end Android market go adrift. Kind of weird when we look back at the Moto X and Moto G programs, launched less than a year ago.</p>
