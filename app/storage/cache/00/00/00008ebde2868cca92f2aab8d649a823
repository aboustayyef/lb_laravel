The artist, whose real name is Thierry Guetta, was a little known figure who popped up in the street art world after his appearance in the 2010 film, Exit Through the Gift Shop. Since then, he has become as prolific and well-known as he has controversial.  Some critics have even claimed he's a hoax conceived by the famously anonymous British graffiti artist, Banksy, in a real-life critique on the vapid artificiality of the art world. 
  
  Indeed, the style of his work would seem an amateur reproduction of Banksy's original street style archetype. And despite the fact that his work has been completed by a team of graphic designers since 2008, Mr. Brainwash's pieces continue to be sold at five and six figure sums. Herein lies the irony: an exhibit called "Life is Beautiful," mocks the mass production of art that our gullible culture readily eats up. Beirut, too, is a charade; the so-called "Paris of the Middle East," an arguably poor imitation for what a real cosmopolitan city should be. 
  
  
  
  Using pop culture imagery, neon colors and iconic figures, Mr. Brainwash's "Life is Beautiful" exhibit, now on display at Gallery 169 in Saifi Village, introduces small alterations to famous images in ways that are meant to evoke a change in perception for the viewer. One particular work shows an Edgar Degas’ painting of ballerinas masked with Charlie Chaplin doing pirouettes. There’s also a General Gaddhafi with Marilyn Monroe-platinum hair and makeup, and a Jackson Pollock painting with Mickey Mouse on top.  It should be noted that much of Mr. Brainwash's work is copyrighted, but the Brainwash experience is less about the artistic effort behind the work than the ideas he intends to orchestrate. 
  
  Alongside the "Life is Beautiful" installation is Patrick Rubenstein’s kinetic art installation. Unlike Mr. Brainwash's work, Rubeinstein’s installation is more of a visual feast, with stunning attention to detail, and offering the baffling realization that even the smallest piece looks as though it took an incredible amount of effort and time to make. Rubenstein’s obsession with argentic photos (which contain silver) and kinetic art works, which depend on movement for effect, compelled him to mix both mediums into a novel form of art that has the effect of changing in form as you walk past it. 
  
  
  
  
  Reminiscent of street billboards, his work is made up of triangular strips, with each side of the strip exposing just a piece of the picture. So as you walk past a Mona Lisa painting, for instance, Mona Lisa slowly starts morphing into something else entirely. It’s truly a remarkable interaction between art and the motions of the viewer, and you're strongly advised to check it out.
  
  Both artists - Brainwash and Rubenstein - are part of the Bel-Air Fine Art group, an international art group based in Geneva and run by Francois Chabanian, a mild mannered, multi-lingual art mogul who has seven galleries spread across Europe and more than 30 artists under his belt. Their works are paraded across the world, from Shanghai to New York. Mr. Chabanian visited Lebanon in 2010 and came away from the trip believing the untapped Middle East market is full of potential for art lovers who are not usually given the chance to experience firsthand the works of international artists. Well, that is no longer the case, thanks to his efforts. The works of these prominent artists are available for you to see in person and even buy, if you are obscenely wealthy.

Though partially deaf, Pierre Geagea, 34, expresses himself not through speech, but through his Mother Tongue - sign language - and contemporary dance.
  
  Born deaf, Pierre was unable to hear or speak until his mid-teens when, with the help of speech therapy and a huge amount of personal effort, he gradually developed the capacity to read lips. 
  
  In the show, Pierre performs on an almost completely bare stage using simple props, including a chair, a table and an aerial silk hammock. At times, a single spotlight dangles from the ceiling, highlighting Geagea's muscular curves and curly hair.
  
  There’s a spontaneous quality to Pierre’s work that translates beautifully into his artistic vision. “I don’t exactly think in terms of choreography. What I care about the most is [how] to integrate sign language and dance in my work,” he said. 
  
  
  
  Assistant Director Sara Maurice describes the show as a culmination of the dancer's own life experiences and development. “This was a show done by Pierre in May and now it’s coming back to the stage. They’ve worked on it a lot more so now it’s like taken to a new level. Pierre interacts with the music, the music interacts with him, and this definitely gives a certain mood to the piece,” she said. 
  
  Mother Tongue features live music from Sharif Sehnaoui and Tony Elieh, pioneer musicians on the Lebanese experimental music scene. The duo worked closely with Pierre to find a harmonious music-movement connection for the performance.
  
  With a childlike smile, Pierre says he was first inspired to dance by Michael Jackson and only became more serious about the effort after he began training at the age of 14 in different dance genres ranging from ballet and jazz to traditional dabkeh. “When I was around 10, I didn’t know much about dance but I used to love Michael Jackson,” he told Beirut.com. Later, turning his talent and passion to contemporary dance, he gradually formed his own distinct means of expression in a style that was further polished by choreographers from prominent Lebanese dance companies such as Caracalla, Arabesque and the Takween Collective. He also recounted his journey in France with La Mission de La Danse which has a special place in his heart. 
  
  Director Nadim Deaibes first worked with Pierre 13-years-ago in a show that became one of the first in Beirut to blend sign language and visual performance. “We got together again last year when I came back from France after assistant choreographer Daniel Balabane told me Pierre was putting on a new show,” Nadim explained. “Pierre came up with the concept and choreography, what we provided was an overall outside look on his existing work in order to pull all the different parts together."
  
  Nadim also made a precious observation about the major challenge of this production: achieving effective communication. Since Pierre primarily relies on lip reading,  this sort of pushed everyone on the team to make themselves clear while communicating. It was a challenge, but it made the group stronger as a whole.
  
  Pierre hopes shows like Mother Tongue will get more people involved in the deaf community in Lebanon and hopes one day the Ministry of Culture will take the initiative to implement effective learning opportunities for people with special needs.
  
  The 45-minute show opens tomorrow at Monnot Theater and is set to run until July 20. Tickets are on sale at all branches of Librairie Antoine and through Antoine Online.

You don’t want to be there, your parents don’t want to be there, the waiters don’t want to be there – it’s just another soul-crushing Lebanese ritual. Having been to as few of these lunches as I could possibly manage, I noticed that the characters are repetitive. These are seven of the most recurring ones you'll see.

  This woman has multiple orgasms when Aїshti has a sale. She gets featured in every edition of Mondanite magazine, where she gets her picture taken for doing nothing all day but attending lunches at which she doesn’t eat. She also doubles as the “passive mom” who is completely oblivious to the fact that her child just bit someone’s ankle. 
  
  5. The Sticky Child</b>

  6. The Inappropriate Distant Relative</b>

Determined atheists that we both are, as the Black Label bottle steadily drained our conversation turned, as it often would, to the evergreen subject of the woefully elevated positions of the region&rsquo;s Parties of God in all their forms and guises.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Man, let me show you something,&rdquo; he suddenly said, reaching for the TV remote. &ldquo;This is why the secularists can&rsquo;t beat the Islamists today.&rdquo; Flicking to one of at least a dozen available Islamic channels, we listened as a shrouded televangelist expounded on the boundless splendors of the pious path. &ldquo;Just listen to the guy&rsquo;s fusha [classical Arabic],&rdquo; my friend said in sincere admiration. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s effortless.&rdquo; And so it was &ndash; without the slightest stutter or pause, our imam filled the room with the music of 7th -century Arabian vocabulary, every single letter adorned with precisely the correct diacritical flourish. Picture someone mellifluously chatting in the tongue of Shakespeare and you&rsquo;ll get something of the oratorical effect.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Now compare that with these guys,&rdquo; said my friend, switching to a political talk show featuring two beardless Jordanians in suits. Clearly ill-at-ease in the fusha they were compelled (by widely-observed custom) to speak on air &ndash; which is likely the only time they speak it &ndash; the contrast in style was disastrous. In awkward monotone, they would punctuate every other word with an &ldquo;uhhh&rdquo; as they frantically scanned their limited mental lexicons for the formally proper noun or adjective. &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter that what they&rsquo;re saying is a thousand times more enlightening than the Islamist propaganda,&rdquo; my friend said. &ldquo;Who could listen to this for more than thirty seconds?&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>That thought came rushing back to me on Saturday when I watched another Islamist, the fugitive cleric-cum-militiaman Ahmad al-Assir, mount an 11-minute-long diatribe  against the &ldquo;liberals&rdquo; (what contempt he put into the word) of Lebanon&rsquo;s moderate Sunni Future Movement. Secure in his amply-demonstrated fusha proficiency, Assir actually reverted to colloquial dialect to land his most personal jab, directed at Future leader Saad Hariri, &ldquo;who doesn&rsquo;t know how to string two words together in Arabic.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s a reference to the former prime minister&rsquo;s famously shaky fusha, most memorably demonstrated in a calamitous  2009 parliament address. But Assir wasn&rsquo;t trying to score literary points: he meant to undermine Hariri&rsquo;s religious, and ultimately political, legitimacy as the representative of Lebanon&rsquo;s Sunnis. It was an assertion of the supposed authenticity, the unshakeable Arabness, of Islamism compared to effete and decadent liberalism.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Older generations of Arab nationalist intellectuals championed the revival and protection of Arabic out of fear that &ldquo;the nation&rdquo; and its culture were losing ground to an ascendant West. Today, the new and graver danger is of young Arab minds being seduced by hyper-articulate jihadists, to whose rhetorical charms even this British kafir is not entirely invulnerable.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Among other things, this makes all the more necessary the secular Arabic literary heritage, from the classic pre-Islamic mu`allaqat through such brilliant medieval reprobates as Abu Nuwas to modern giants like Mahmoud Darwish. Indeed, there&rsquo;s reason to believe a thread running through the entire oeuvre of the permanently clean-shaven Darwish, who never hid his dislike of Hamas and lamented those who &ldquo;don&rsquo;t know the difference between the mosque (al-jam`) and the university (al-jam`a),&rdquo; was an unspoken determination to claim Arabic (and specifically classical Arabic, the clerics&rsquo; home ground) for an avowedly secular renaissance, or nahda. (The contribution of those who manage to turn these works into music and other art forms &ndash; Marcel Khalif&eacute; being perhaps the most obvious example &ndash; is also invaluable, not least because of the profanity of music in and of itself in the Wahhabist worldview. One recalls Khalif&eacute;&rsquo;s farcical 1999 blasphemy trial.)
