Now it is the banks that are taking their businesses to Iraq. But while the banks see a lot of promise in the Iraqi market, their small investment to date reflects the major difficulties of operating a commercial bank in Iraq.</p>
<div><p>Iraq is still one of the most under-banked countries in the MENA region, with estimates that 80 percent of the population does not have a bank account.</p>
</div>
<p>With seven Lebanese banks operating 14 branches in Iraq, and giants BLOM Bank and Bank Audi set to enter the market within the year, more than half of Lebanon’s alpha group banks will be represented. These banks see potential in the Iraqi market as it undergoes modernization and revitalization of both physical and financial infrastructure. Though they already make up half of the total foreign banks present in Iraq, excluding representative offices, Lebanese banks’ investment in Iraq is still “light” compared to their capital base, according to Sader, and their activities are still limited.</p>
<p><b>Room for growth</b></p>
<p><a href="http://www.executive-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/20140609-tourist-arrivals.png"><img src="http://www.executive-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/20140609-tourist-arrivals.png" alt="20140609-tourist-arrivals" width="600" height="285"></a></p>
<p> </p>
<p>After a slight drop between 2008 and 2009, Iraq’s nominal GDP has consistently grown from its 2009 level of $111.7 billion to $215.8 billion in 2012, <a href="http://databank.worldbank.org/data/views/reports/tableview.aspx#" target="_blank">according to the World Bank</a>. Domestic credit to the private sector as a percent of GDP has been rising steadily, from 3.8 percent in 2009 to 6 percent in 2012. While still small compared to the regional average — at 23.6 percent of GDP in 2012 for MENA minus the GCC and Israel — the increase in lending as a percentage of GDP is a positive and promising trend.</p>
<p>According to a <a href="http://www.iraq-businessnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Sansar-Capital-Iraq-Bank-Sector-Report-May-June-2013.pdf" target="_blank">2013 report by Singapore-based but Iraq-focused Sansar Capital</a>, Iraq is still one of the most under-banked countries in the MENA region, with estimates that 80 percent of the population does not have a bank account. According to the World Bank, the country had 5.4 commercial bank branches per 100,000 people in 2012. By comparison, Lebanon had 29.3 branches per 100,000 people.</p>
<p>The lack of ATMs — two for every 100,000 inhabitants — is exacerbated by the fact that most ATMs are not connected to a national switch and thus customers from one bank cannot use the ATM of another bank to make transactions, creating more barriers to consumer banking. These pose both opportunities and constraints for Lebanese banks moving into the country.</p>
<p>However, several reform efforts appear promising. Two projects to facilitate retail banking are in the pipeline. The first is the implementation of a national switch that would connect ATMs of various banks. The second is the Iraq Interoperable Mobile Payments System (IIMPS), which could dramatically increase the penetration of banking among the cash-oriented population. Both projects are due to begin pilot testing this summer.</p>
<div><p>Despite minimal interference from an Iraqi controller, it’s not easy being a commercial bank in Iraq, where state owned banks dominate the field and enjoy several privileges over their commercial counterparts.</p>
</div>
<p>Another encouraging development is the government’s efforts to develop the country’s infrastructure, which could lead to an increase in economic output triggering an increase in demand for banking services. In 2013 the Iraqi Ministry of Planning <a href="http://www.iraq-businessnews.com/2013/09/18/new-357bn-national-development-plan/" target="_blank">launched Iraq’s second National Development Plan</a>, which laid out a roadmap for the country’s economic recovery between 2013 and 2017. The plan consists of a $357 billion investment in infrastructure in various sectors of the Iraqi economy. If carried out, it could have a massive effect on the economy: in general, the World Bank estimates a 1 percent increase in economic output for every 10 percent increase in infrastructure allocation. Iraq’s total national budget in 2013 was $118 billion.</p>
<p>These projects could increase both lending and deposits at banks. According to <a href="http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTMENA/Resources/QuickNote44.pdf" target="_blank">a 2011 World Bank report</a>, Iraq’s asset-to-GDP ratio was 73 percent after adjusting for certain state owned banks’ overstated asset valuations — compared to 130 percent for the MENA region.</p>
<p>Such numbers appeal to Lebanese banks, which are putting their faith in the growth of Iraq’s economy and banking sector. “With time, I believe the banking industry will grow, and quickly,” says Fahim Mo’dad, advisor to the chairman at BLOM Bank and the individual responsible for the bank’s expansion into Iraq. BLOM is planning to open two branches within the year, one in Erbil and one in Baghdad, according to Mo’dad.</p>
<p><strong><span>R</span>egulation and restriction</strong></p>
<p>Lebanese banks in Iraq are subject to <a href="http://www.cbi.iq/documents/banking_law_f.pdf" target="_blank">the country’s 2003 Banking Law</a>, as well as the same international regulations they are following elsewhere. Licenses for a foreign-owned bank in Iraq are issued by the Central Bank of Iraq (CBI), and require compliance monitoring from the country where the parent bank’s head office is located. They also require the Lebanese central bank’s approval. Sader explains that the Lebanese Banking Control Commission signed an agreement with its Iraqi counterpart that would make BDL control their activities in Iraq. “[The CBI] doesn’t have the human resources to control … [BDL] is helping them to control our maximum,” says Sader.</p>
<div><p>The lack of ATMs — two for every 100,000 inhabitants — is exacerbated by the fact that most ATMs are not connected to a national switch … creating more barriers to consumer banking.</p>
</div>
<p>Despite minimal interference from an Iraqi controller, it’s not easy being a commercial bank in Iraq, where state owned banks dominate the field and enjoy several privileges over their commercial counterparts. State owned banks have a monopoly on transactions involving the government and government owned companies. In a country where the government controls the oil sector, which accounts for three fifths of the economy, and where the public sector and state owned enterprises <a href="http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/COUNTRIES/MENAEXT/IRAQEXTN/0,,menuPK:313115~pagePK:141132~piPK:141107~theSitePK:313105,00.html" target="_blank">employ about half the labor force</a>, this places severe limits on the business of commercial banks.</p>
<p>Government entities and state owned enterprises cannot, for instance, place deposits with commercial banks, and payments to the government (such as taxes) cannot be drawn from commercial banks. Likewise, <a href="http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTMENA/Resources/QuickNote44.pdf" target="_blank">state-owned agencies cannot receive loans from commercial banks</a>.</p>
<p>This has led to the disproportionate size of state owned banks compared to commercial banks in Iraq. According to Abdul Aziz Hassoun, executive director of the Iraqi Private Banks League, the seven state-owned banks account for more than half of all bank capital with IQD 14 trillion ($12 billion) out of a total IQD 25 trillion ($21.4 billion).</p>
<p>According to Hassoun, Lebanese banks are under the same constraints as any commercial bank in Iraq. The only transactions Lebanese banks can do in Iraq with government accounts or government owned entities is issuing letters of guarantees (LGs). They cannot, for instance, take deposits, make transfers or issue letters of credit (LCs) from these entities. This was confirmed by Elias Achkar, head of the research department at ABL. However, Sader claims that Lebanese banks are trying to work out a deal where they would be able to make transactions with the government and government owned companies.</p>
<p><strong><span>S</span>tarting small</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.executive-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/20140609-iraq-banks-map.png"><img src="http://www.executive-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/20140609-iraq-banks-map.png" alt="20140609-iraq-banks-map" width="300" height="300"></a></p>
<p>Despite the room for growth in lending to the Iraqi market and the competitive edge of Lebanese banks with superior technical infrastructure and internal processes, it is not the lending ceiling that is imposed on every Lebanese bank abroad by the BDL that is crippling their activities. In fact, lending activity only accounts for a small margin of their profits.</p>
<p>According to Sader, the primary activity of Lebanese banks in Iraq is trade finance, with their primary source of revenue coming from LCs and LGs. They also make margins off foreign currency auctions, whereby they buy foreign currency from the Central Bank of Iraq at the daily currency auction — the only way to convert the Iraqi dinar — and then sell it to their clients with a certain margin of profit allowed by the CBI, according to Mo’dad.</p>
<p>Their smaller lending activities are mostly geared toward their Lebanese clients, according to Hassoun, who claims it is normal for a foreign bank to first capitalize on these business relations. “When Standard Chartered came to the country, they were only covering the needs of British companies working in construction and oil,” he says.</p>
<p>Focusing on Lebanese clients is also less risky for the bank. “The institutional environment in Iraq is lacking. If we want to lend money to a client, they don’t have a ‘centrale des risques’, they don’t have a clearing house,” says Sader, “They will start with Lebanese clients, which is easier because they might have information on them for Lebanon,” says Mo’dad.</p>
<p>Despite these setbacks, Sader claims that the Iraqi banking sector is working on modernizing its infrastructure, something the Lebanese banking sector is well poised to assist them with. In April, the Iraqi-Lebanese Banking Conference was held in Beirut which highlighted a common interest of both sectors in improving the banking environment in Iraq’s recovering economy. With time and the right developments, the hope is that Lebanese banks’ strategy of early entry into Iraq will pay off handsomely.</p>

Index movements in nine of the twelve markets during the week were by less than two percent — except for a renewed hike in the EGX 30 and corrections in Qatar and Abu Dhabi, which were all between three and four percent. Besides Egypt’s 3.1 percent gain, seven markets moved up, but for six of them, the range of advance was between 0.1 and 1 percent. Beirut and Casablanca joined Abu Dhabi and Doha in moving down.</p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.executive-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/20140609-indices-week-23.png"><img src="http://www.executive-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/20140609-indices-week-23.png" alt="Index performance" width="300" height="522"></a></span></p>
<p><strong>Emerging players</strong></p>
<p>The impact of the transition of the United Arab Emirates and Qatar <a href="http://www.executive-magazine.com/business-finance/finance/msci-announcement-drives-markets" target="_blank">from frontier to emerging markets status in the MSCI</a> once again — but possibly for the last time for some while — was the most visible driver of index developments in the Gulf Cooperation Council.</p>
<p>The QE General Index closed the week 3.4 percent lower, but when compared with its intraday all-time peak of 13,909 points on May 29, the gauge dropped nearly 5 percent in a week. Abu Dhabi — which closed last month very near to a multi-year record, also achieved intraday on May 29 — fell by almost 4 percent. Dubai, on the other hand, was not quite as ebullient in the last week of May and eked out a 0.3 percent gain.</p>
<p>With MSCI EM-tracking passive funds entering the three markets at the end of May and in the first few days of June, the volumes of trade on all three were significantly above average in the first two to three sessions of the new month, but tapered out toward the end of the trading week. According to reports by two UAE newspapers, <a href="http://gulfnews.com/business/markets/dfm-drops-2-51-adx-falls-1-14-1.1344639" target="_blank">Gulf News</a> and <a href="http://www.thenational.ae/business/industry-insights/markets/uae-stock-markets-buzz-with-activity-on-day-one-of-msci-upgrade" target="_blank">The National</a>, local market participation during the week was characterized on one hand by investor caution in the aftermath of recent hyperactive trading, but on the other hand also saw many new and inexperienced day traders come onto the scene in search of wins.</p>
<p><strong>Expanding frontiers</strong></p>
<p>A fourth GCC market that was affected by MSCI’s reshuffle of its Frontier and Emerging Markets index compositions is Kuwait. It remains part of the Frontier Markets index, but the representation of Kuwaiti stocks in the FM Investable Markets Index — which MSCI stated as 16.45 percent in the index’s May 30 factsheet — was set to expand by about six percentage points after the index’s rebalancing due to the reclassification of Qatari and Emirati stocks which had been part of the FM IMI. Reports on GCC markets said that the KSE could see increased funds inflows due to the KSE’s enlarged role in the Frontier Markets indices.</p>
<p>However, impact of the increased MSCI weightings of KSE-listed stocks on their share prices did not jump last week out either in terms of the KSE Index performance or via price changes of the stocks with the highest FM IMI weightings, which according to the May 30 factsheet were National Bank of Kuwait (NBK), telecommunications group Zain and Kuwait Finance House (KFH).</p>
<p>The KSE Index fluctuated by not more than 2 percent and subdued trade volumes on the KSE were in no way comparable to the May 29 and June 1 surges of activity seen in the UAE and Qatar. According to market statistics by Kuwait Financial Center Markaz, the share prices of NBK, Zain and KFH dropped by 1 percent, 1.16 percent and 1.22 percent respectively in the first week of June. Trade volumes of NBK, Zain and Agility, another large cap KSE company in the FM index, were elevated but not radically so. Agility, a logistics company, was the only large cap Kuwaiti company that recorded a substantial price gain in the week, moving up by 4.9 percent.</p>
<p>Overall, local factors such as the perceived lack of transparency, as well as disclosure practices marred by time delays and alleged information leaks seemed to remain much stronger influences on the KSE than the country’s inconclusive position of being a major frontier market.</p>
<p>Saudi Arabia’s Tadawul, the largest securities market in the MENA, progressed to a new post-financial crisis high on June 1. While the TASI closed the week only with a small gain, this further supported the bourse’s overall impression as having a stable upward trajectory. The index action on the Bahrain Bourse was unremarkable for yet another week. The Muscat Securities Market continued a rise that started on May 28 and was the GCC’s strongest gainer in the week.</p>
<p>In the context of market valuations and long-term performances, the Omani and Bahraini markets are positioned having the GCC’s lowest price to earnings ratios at 10.5 and 11.7 respectively at the end of May, according to Markaz. Tadawul is more costly with a P/E ratio of 17.1, but although it has gained 17 percent in the year to date, it is still is almost 11,000 points below its historic pre-crisis peak. Consequently, the TASI has the room to gain almost 110 percent — more than any other GCC market — before it would reach another all time index record.</p>
<p><strong>North Africa & the Levant</strong></p>
<p>In the North African markets, the Tunisian Stock Exchange showed some micro-volatility, but the Tunindex moved sideways, closing yet another week of flat performance. The MASI’s performance reflected a week of almost daily drops on the Casablanca Stock Exchange; the market recorded a close below 9,400 points for the first time since the end of February. In the context of the past 12 months, however, the MASI remains on middle ground. With a 3.1 percent gain, the Egyptian market recouped part of the territory lost in the previous, rather volatile <a href="http://www.executive-magazine.com/business-finance/finance/market-presidential-plummet" target="_blank">election week</a>. Before climbing 150 points on Wednesday, June 4, and more than 380 points on June 5, the EGX 30 had finished two of the week’s sessions below 8,000 points.</p>
<p>The Amman Stock Exchange continued an upward momentum that started in the previous week and gained 1 percent in the ASE Index. The BLOM Index for the Beirut Stock Exchange saw about half of its gain from the previous week wither away, dropping 0.9 percent in the week.</p>

<p><strong>The idea: </strong>Girnaas is a game making and publishing studio that strives to bring new stories into the fast world of gaming, which has a high rate of recycling old titles. Many popular games come out with a second, a third — even a sixth version. And characters such as Aladdin, one of the many characters in famous collection of Middle Eastern folk tales “One Thousand and One Nights,” are constantly being recycled, while other lesser known characters remain in the shadows. It is the stories of these lesser known characters that Girnaas is trying to tell through their games.</p>
<p><strong>Traction:</strong> Thus far Girnaas has published three games and reached 350,000 downloads, according to the team. The games are free, with the company focusing on building traction. The team plans to eventually license their ideas and characters to generate revenue.</p>

The platform enables them to gather data throughout the life of a project in one place, also giving them a dashboard that displays the progression of the data — something that can be used to impress donors. The data is stored on a cloud, but there is an offline version that NGO officers can use when working in places without an internet connection, which can later be synced with the cloud.</p>
<p><strong>Traction:</strong> AidBits is used by the Palestine branches of the NGOs <a href="http://www.pu-ami.org/" target="_blank">Première Urgence</a> and <a href="http://www.care-international.org/" target="_blank">Care International</a>, who are their paying clients, as well as several other NGOs who are still in the free trial mode. Première Urgence liked the product so much that they wanted the rest of their offices to start using the platform. The company charges a yearly fee for their software.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.theblackbox.me/" target="_blank">BlackBox</a></strong></p>
<p>Founded: 2013</p>
<p>Country: Lebanon</p>
<p>Cofounders: Christine Dwairi and George Eid</p>
<p><strong>The idea:</strong> BlackBox prints photos at events that attendees upload on Instagram with the event’s hashtag. It prints old school polaroid-like photos, which gives partygoers a memory of the event, all the while promoting the brand hosting the event by its active presence over social media. The BlackBox team rents the equipment to the hosts of the event, and provides them with support services. At the end of the event, BlackBox also presents a report with an analysis of the likes, comments, impressions and context of the social media content.</p>
<p><strong>Traction:</strong> BlackBox’s first event was in November 2013 in Beirut at the <a href="http://www.redbull.com/mea/en/music/stories/1331621766738/mashrou-leila-clashed-with-who-killed-bruce-lee" target="_blank">Red Bull Soundclash</a> between Lebanese bands Mashrou’ Leila and Who Killed Bruce Lee. Besides Red Bull,  their clients include Absolute Vodka and Time Out. They’ve done events in Beirut, Dubai, Doha and New York.</p>

<p>Founded in: 2011</p>
<p>Country: Spain</p>
<p>Founder: Gerard Vidal</p>
<p><strong>The idea</strong>: Enigmedia encrypts information in real time using a technology that improves transmission by using less bandwidth, making the information sent of better quality. It is well adapted to high definition real time video transmission — for instance getting rid of pixelation. Its complexity also makes it more difficult to hack in a world where the increase in communication over digital media is paired with a concomitant increase in security issues. The technology uses an algorithm that was developed by founder Gerard Vidal while writing his doctoral thesis.</p>
<p><strong>Traction: </strong>Enigmedia’s clients include Deloitte Barcelona, Football Club Barcelona and La Caixa bank. They charge a monthly fee for the software, which can be used either through an app or through Enigmedia’s television platform.</p>

Usually the real challenge in most markets is that the investors don’t have their act together, the investors don’t take risks and the investors don’t know how to build their own ecosystems.”</p>
<p>Hearty applause followed these words, spoken by <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2F500hats.com%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNFPf5tKFNKDXXL99FXIVj2lE014vA" target="_blank">Dave McClure</a> in his keynote speech at <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.executive-magazine.com%2Fbuzz%2Farabnet-dubai-the-next-step&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNEhzs72M3n-cg3dlXmhb99PZWTbGQ" target="_blank">ArabNet’s Digital Summit in Dubai</a>. But he quickly added a caveat: “Investors aren’t the only ones to blame; entrepreneurs screw a lot of things up, too.”</p>
<p>McClure is an entrepreneur, angel investor and founding partner of global seed-stage venture capital fund and accelerator <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2F500.co%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNGSITNR7fBbWROl-S0FQQRBLhu_hA" target="_blank">500 Startups</a>. He is also behind the initiative <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fgeeksonaplane.com%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNE-m7Oci2q4pqDxml2fG_iFeurgyA" target="_blank">Geeks on a Plane</a>, which organizes international tours for startups, investors and executives to learn about and visit high-growth technology markets around the world.</p>
<p>McClure’s balanced statements pin investors and entrepreneurs as having equally important responsibilities to work toward the success of a company. But risk-averse investors need to play their game right — in his keynote, he went on to stress that a successful ecosystem requires early access to capital and early investor optimism.</p>
<p>He points to Estonia as a prime example, where early investors in Skype took a large risk very early. Though investing early does not always garner the same success across the board, McClure cites early optimism as a key factor that breeds trust in an ecosystem.</p>
<p>In the MENA, this optimism will likely have to come from regional investors. Panelists at ArabNet’s “What’s Hot in Web and Mobile” discussion agreed that foreign investors were somewhat skeptical of investing in regional internet companies because the region has yet to see a breakout hit. They were also doubtful of the companies’ ability to scale internationally, since many regional startups are copies of international counterparts. While this might attract regional venture capital because of startups’ proven business models, it limits their potential for international growth. VCs therefore need to encourage entrepreneurs to think globally. “Not just a blanket for this region, but something that will make fundamental global change,” said panelist Ben Parr of VC firm <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fangel.co%2Fdominatefund&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNHSWVKCyz2dAe3aIyWq8ucYRAFueA" target="_blank">DominateFund</a>.</p>
<p>Early optimism, however, appears to be lacking among MENA investors. And while there is a lot of money, regional investors are still too shy to take the kind of risks that could result in explosive success.</p>
<p>The dearth of optimism ends up killing both sides. Too little money for an entrepreneur, paired with large stakes of equity for a cautious and controlling investor can end up stifling a business rather than giving it space to flourish. “If you squeeze the entrepreneur out of equity, he will be demotivated and the [venture capital firm] becomes the owner, which lessens [the entrepreneur’s] chance to make a profit,” said Hervé Cuviliez, CEO of digital media company <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fcorp.diwanee.com%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNGoCFv4Ah5h54UL8Qs6RSlxSO_xkg" target="_blank">Diwanee</a>.</p>
<p>It seems that the region’s best option is to establish good practices among local investors. At a panel on “The Rise of the Big VC,” Habib Haddad, serial entrepreneur and CEO of <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.wamda.com&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNHBxhSzVohx5ll4jvxRM6mQ9Yi05Q" target="_blank">Wamda</a>, recognized some qualities that make for good investors. “A great VC invests and keeps injecting capital in the long run,” he said. VCs should make sure the financial needs of the entrepreneurs are met, such as finding follow-on funding, while leaving the entrepreneurs do their thing, he said, “not to own the entrepreneur.”</p>

When the <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.executive-magazine.com%2Fbuzz%2Fcompetition-happiness-rankings&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNGNUaP_tgeHPzEXRUcx6fzFvhNUlQ">Positive Experience Index (PEI)</a> of 138 countries was released last month by global opinion surveying organization Gallup, Executive noted how Syria’s war had wrecked havoc on its people’s positive emotions and sense of happiness.</p>
<p>Now we have the pain test. In its just-released <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gallup.com%2Fpoll%2F170819%2Fhappiness-short-supply-iran.aspx&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNHBRkl2Bj2VA6BbbGSdREYeEr3lUQ">Negative Experience Index (NEI)</a>, Gallup measured the prevalence of negative emotions, and it shows a very clear and unenviable clustering of bad vibes in the Middle East and North Africa. According to the 2013 NEI, half of the ten most emotionally downtrodden countries — where people told surveyors they felt anger, stress, pain and worry the day prior — were in MENA. The rest of this unenviable top ten list was comprised of one country in each Asia and Africa, and three jurisdictions in Europe’s eastern Mediterranean.</p>
<p>Iraq led the ranking on negative experiences, followed by Iran. Egypt and Greece were tied in third place, ahead of Syria. Lebanon made the tenth spot in the NEI, where a higher rank indicates that more people felt negative emotions.</p>
<p>In similar fashion, the PEI had ranked countries by translating the number of ‘yes’ answers to positive-emotions questions into an index score. The two indices are not, however, inverses of each other. Syria’s fifth place finish in the NEI did not mirror its last place finish in the PIE; similarly, while Iraqis reported more negative emotions than anyone else, they also reported more positive emotions than those in 23 other locations.</p>
<p>In presenting the NEI findings, Gallup placed a strong emphasis on Iran’s lack of happiness, opining that “Iranians have every right to feel negative, given the high unemployment coupled with high inflation in their country that has crippled their ability to provide for their families, along with international sanctions over their nuclear program that have hurt their livelihoods.”</p>
<p>But while Iran ranked highly on the NEI, the Islamic republic actually scored 63 points in the PEI, placing it in the lower middle field of countries and tied with Luxembourg, South Korea, Kazakhstan and Czech Republic. It clearly underperformed on a global scale, but within the region compared favorably to both Syria and Iraq.</p>
<p>In short, emotions are complicated — and at times, seemingly contradictory.</p>

Executive sat down for an interview with Dany Baz, Bankdata’s general manager, to enhance our understanding of the latest developments in the sector.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What is your most striking impression from recent data on banking in Lebanon?</strong></p>
<p>What strikes me first is once again the resilience of the banking sector that was able to maintain a satisfactory performance despite the increasingly tough operating conditions. The banks that have chosen to expand regionally have handled the downturn in neighboring countries with minimal impact on their financial strength and performance, while banks that focused on the domestic market have had to face the slowdown of the Lebanese economy and the increasingly competitive operating conditions and have also managed to keep up.</p>
<p>Another striking fact is that there are pockets of opportunities for banks domestically, as some segments are under-borrowed; the SME [small and medium enterprise] sector for instance has also shown resilience versus the economic slowdown. Many of these enterprises have also decided to go cross border and have done so successfully.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>How does the under-borrowing of SMEs affect us?</strong></p>
<p>On a global level, the economy is running at a much slower pace than it should be. Companies in the category of small and medium enterprises, meaning SMEs with more than 5 and up to 150 employees, number approximately 20,000 companies that generate around $5 billion of annual turnover. If you take into consideration that there are something like 200,000 registered establishments, this shows that these 10 percent of enterprises generate around 10 percent of Lebanon’s GDP [of $43 billion]. Interestingly, only over a third of these SMEs are borrowers and their borrowings amount to around $2 billion of various loans and facilities. If this ratio is raised to 50 percent, it would represent about $600 million of untapped business for banks over the upcoming years.</p>
<p> </p>
<div><p>There is quite a lot that the banks are doing for the economy and they should not be penalized because of the transparency they have adopted. </p>
</div>
<p><strong>Currently, with debates over profits and taxes of banks, it seems that the banker is everyone’s favorite villain. Do they deserve it?</strong></p>
<p>Banks are traditionally the driving force behind economic growth and consequently contribute to the welfare of citizens. Obviously, banks are profit-oriented organizations and are definitely into improving their profitability and shareholder value. But I think you can say that of any venture and in some businesses, like the food industry where you can poison people, you have many more ethical concerns than in the money or service business.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Are banks paying enough taxes? </strong></p>
<p>They are the biggest taxpayers in the country. They contribute more than one third of all taxes on profit and bank employees contribute nearly 30 percent of all payroll taxes in Lebanon. Banks settled about $400 million in taxes in 2012. Tell me one sector that is doing the same. I think banks are the number one employer, the number one taxpayer, and they don’t even recoup VAT [value added tax]. There is quite a lot that the banks are doing for the economy and they should not be penalized because of the transparency they have adopted. Tax evasion is estimated at $3 billion yearly, i.e. 7 percent of GDP — this is where the real change should take place.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>In your opinion, would a permanent increase in the taxation rate of banks impact the economy?</strong></p>
<p>I honestly don’t think that raising [VAT] by 2 percentage points is going to rock the boat. The problem is that the economy is in a slowdown and there is very little leeway for the government today. In a different context, I don’t think 2 percent would make a difference. But today nothing [in terms of tax increase] is acceptable.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>That is on VAT in general. But how about the specific taxes on banks that have been proposed?</strong></p>
<p>When you have a sector that is vital for the economy, you don’t want to burden it in times such as these. In my view, everything that was discussed is acceptable and I am sure even the banks will say that — but is it acceptable today? No.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What would you consider as a minimum healthy growth rate and prudent performance indicator for the banking sector?</strong></p>
<p>The IMF estimates a 5 percent growth in customer deposits is the minimum required to finance public and private borrowing needs. I wouldn’t take the growth of assets as a measure for the health of banks. I would take the return on equity. Today we are at just over 12 percent in return on equity and this is low if we take a look at other financial sectors in MENA countries. Everybody will expect the ratio to be closer to 20 percent.</p>
<p> </p>
<div><p>Tax evasion is estimated at $3 billion yearly, i.e. 7 percent of GDP — this is where the real change should take place</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Bankdata is the organization that initiated categorization of banks according to deposits. What is the rationale for making the distinction between alpha, beta, gamma and delta group banks?</strong></p>
<p>Segmentation helps external people and the bankers themselves to benchmark against banks of the same size with comparable operating conditions in terms of network and staff, for instance. You have to compare apples to apples: the purpose was to facilitate comparisons.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>You raised the threshold of financial size for the alpha banks to $2 billion in deposits quite a while back. When was that and why is it prudent to keep it at that level still today?</strong></p>
<p>We raised it in 2004 so it will be ten years this year. We review it every year to see if a change in the definition of categories is warranted but if the difference [between the old and new deposit size benchmark] is around 10 percent, it is not worth [changing] it. The issue is to have a look at the even distribution of the four categories and not just the top banks.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Your company is regarded as the authority on measuring the performance of Lebanese banks. Should that be done by a private sector company, or rather by a government agency?</strong></p>
<p>I don’t think it is the purpose of the regulator to publish market shares and ranks but rather to monitor compliance and follow up on performance. We are much more flexible in our approach and have two-way communication with the banks, which is not something that you would have if you were addressing this from the public sector.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>How confident are you that the information you publish is accurate, especially on some highly watched ratios where people might want to look better than they are?</strong></p>
<p>They cannot because we have our own controls, both specific and general. Of course there are human errors and if we see a growth rate by a bank that is incoherent on any criteria, even if it is a small item on the balance sheet, we immediately call the bank. And if there is a correction in one bank, we call 70 banks to align. This is our added value.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>How many items do you check each time when you review the banking performance?</strong></p>
<p>That is an interesting question and I have never looked at it this way. (Consults briefly with staff.) We review 410 items times 70 banks times two because we control two years in every edition [of the Bilanbanques yearbook]. That means we cover 57,000 pieces of data for every edition.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Do you do that for the love of numbers?</strong></p>
<p>No, for the love of credibility.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>How did the concept occur to you?</strong></p>
<p>This is a company that was founded by my husband, Freddie [Baz]. He started it 32 years ago because this is his forte and I learned the job. The methodology and the continuous enhancement and update of the methodology rely a lot on him but I have been running the show.</p>
<p> </p>
<div><p>Some banks provide unpublished figures and if they request for them not to be published, they will never be published or made available to anybody</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Are there any conflicts of interest for Bankdata because of the fact that your husband is a senior executive at the top bank in Lebanon?</strong></p>
<p>When he first started with [Bank] Audi, he was merely an adviser and there was no particular drawback. At some point, perhaps other banks might have felt a conflict of interest but they have realized that this is not the case. We cannot twist figures in any way. In addition, the fact that he combines macro and micro views and experience are a plus to continuously update and enhance our methodology.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>So you would not provide information exclusively or faster to one bank than any other?</strong></p>
<p>I would be shooting myself in the foot, honestly. The open climate that we have with the banks is based on them knowing that we are very keen on preserving [confidentiality]. They trust us with their figures. Some banks provide unpublished figures and if they request for them not to be published, they will never be published or made available to anybody.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What valuation do you attribute to the company that you manage?</strong></p>
<p>Bankdata is a profitable company, but it is not a company that will crush records of profitability. We are a service company and also do consulting and have very decent revenue. We have invested into our platform but if I were to value the qualitative part of it and not the multiples, the benefit to the sector is really priceless.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Are you a family business?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, we are.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Do you have succession planning?</strong></p>
<p>We should (laughs). Probably [the succession] will not be in the family, so we would have to transform.</p>

The launch was announced Tuesday by David Munir Nabti, CEO of Lebanese startup space <a href="http://www.altcity.me/" target="_blank">AltCity</a>.</p>
<p>Choosing the afternoon of the first day of ArabNet Digital Summit 2014 in Dubai to unveil the new group, Nabti explains that MEGAplay is an initiative to help Middle Eastern startups take advantage of the appetite for games in the Middle East. “Gaming is a huge sector regionally, but startups are not tapping into that,” he says.</p>
<p>Nabti announced that MEGAplay will provide various support to gaming startups. It will offer workshops — both online and offline — using expert know-how to put regional companies on a more competitive footing in a global market <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.newzoo.com%2Fpress-releases%2Fnewzoo-announces-new-report-and-projects-global-games-market-to-grow-6-to-70-4bn-in-2013%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNEUOKEom-aotVL2ue8PzOngAMcS0A">worth perhaps $70 billion</a>. The idea is “to help people start games [and] develop new concepts that are at the leading edge of trends, rather than behind the curve,” says Nabti. It will also hold competitions and help connect startups to investors.</p>
<p>MEGAplay is the brainchild of AltCity, with seed funding from the Netherlands Embassy in Lebanon. The initiative builds on AltCity’s involvement in gaming events in Beirut, as well as its lighter dabbling in the region. One such event was the group’s <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.altcity.me%2Flebanese-app-and-game-developers-develop-working-versions-in-less-than-12-hours%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNF2dnR6LaHt0Qb5ehaCV38R2E2ylw" target="_blank">Beirut hackathon</a> on May 3, which brought together developers, designers and entrepreneurs to build mobile apps and games within a 12 hour time frame.</p>
<p>But gaming is also a notoriously tough industry. An often cited example is the story behind Angry Birds, where Finnish developer Rovio <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.wired.co.uk%2Fmagazine%2Farchive%2F2011%2F04%2Ffeatures%2Fhow-rovio-made-angry-birds-a-winner&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNFFYnKMATuFpO6253T6NGMuR4Q7Ug">failed 51 times</a> at creating a viral game before producing an overnight success. This makes gaming startups inherently risky.</p>
<p>And regionally, the sector is <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.wamda.com%2F2013%2F11%2Foverview-gaming-sector-arab-world&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNEUKuCKcLiLMTgLQDafaRBoIbx8MA">quickly evolving</a>, with promising names such as Jordan’s Taktek <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.wamda.com%2F2013%2F01%2Fwhy-jordanian-gaming-company-taktek-closed&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNHAxHPa5EdH2uDkJYUy7TQwRPCCIg">fizzling</a>. Walid Hanna, managing partner at regional venture capital firm Middle East Venture Partners, told Executive in December that while the group had invested in gaming startups, they were trying to refrain from investing in them in the future because of the uncertainty of business.</p>
<p>When presented with these concerns, Nabti remains convinced of the potential of the market. He explains that the volatile nature of the business makes it all the more important how companies build themselves, learn to appreciate risk and increase their chances of success by developing the best methods.</p>
<p>“Gaming is already a huge market, and is becoming more connected to people’s lives,” he says, even to the point of overtaking cinema and TV.</p>

A typical Lebanese business model is to test a product in Lebanon before scaling to the region. This reflects at once the limits of the very small Lebanese market, but also the increasing nature of seeking solutions that cover the entire Arab world.</p>
<p>Besides catering to the region, Lebanese companies are increasingly drawn to Dubai, an important regional hub for big businesses and the Middle Eastern capital of marketing and advertising. The move is a logical expansion for a Lebanese company — some relocating their businesses there altogether.</p>
<p>Likewise, <a href="https://arabnet.me/" target="_blank">ArabNet</a> — a hub and conference organizer for digital entrepreneurs and professionals in the Arab world — expanded from its birthplace in Beirut to Dubai. The move was very successful: its Dubai event is now larger the original Beirut conference. This is due partly because of the political situation in Lebanon and partly because Dubai, being the business hub that it is today, is an attractive destination for regional companies to mingle. When Executive caught up with ArabNet founder Omar Christidis before March’s ArabNet Beirut, <a href="http://www.executive-magazine.com/business-finance/business/omar-christidis-arabnet-interview-startups" target="_blank">he explained</a> that while the Lebanon event focused on the local Levantine market as a production hub for the region, the Dubai event would be more focused on big business.</p>
<p>Indeed, the conference will highlight many aspects of big businesses — the latest trends in e-commerce, marketing and advertising from industry leaders. But entrepreneurs also have a selection of talks to choose from for promoting startup ecosystems in the region — with the government-owned tech park <a href="https://www.dsoa.ae/en/about-dso.jsp" target="_blank">Dubai Silicon Oasis</a>, local i360 accelerator’s space <a href="http://i360accelerator.com/" target="_blank">The Cribb</a> and the digital startup incubator <a href="http://afkar.me/" target="_blank">Afkar</a> among others represented.</p>
<p>Exhibitions and a digital showcase will highlight businesses big and small, creating opportunities for the two to liaise. Larger companies such as transportation and logistics company Aramex, market research company IPSOS and online payment gateway Gate2Play will be represented alongside smaller ones. Some of these smaller businesses were present at the Beirut event, such as animation company <a href="http://wezank.com/" target="_blank">Wezank</a> and social media topic analyzer tool Crowd Analyzer — which made the list of <a href="http://www.executive-magazine.com/business-finance/business/top-startup-pitches-arabnet" target="_blank">Executive’s favorite startups</a> from ArabNet Beirut.</p>
<p>The combination of panels where industry leaders share best practices and startups showcase the newest technological innovations makes ArabNet the epicenter of tech and entrepreneurship in the region for the next three days. Stay tuned for Executive’s coverage of ArabNet Digital Summit Dubai.</p>

Last week, <a href="http://www.executive-magazine.com/business-finance/finance/creditbank-on-the-lending-prowl">Executive published a longer piece about Creditbank</a>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The impression from our conversation on Creditbank is that you neither aim to be the richest banker in town nor are angling for the biggest bragging rights. Why are you a banker?</strong></p>
<p>I don’t regard myself only as a banker. If you think of yourself as a banker, you reduce yourself to calculating your margin on every transaction. I like to think of myself as a common denominator in the business world where people need a financier.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>How do you define the difference? </strong></p>
<p>Being a financier is more than being a banker. People think of a banker as someone who gets a lick of every deal that passes under his nose. This is not the picture that I have. If you asked me what I think of Creditbank, I would tell you that Creditbank is catering to people who are producing. If you are involved in banking in Lebanon today and like it, it is because you think everything is undervalued.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Undervalued in what way? </strong></p>
<p>I think everything in Lebanon could be at a higher and better value. This is the confidence that we have in this market and this is why we still lend to people in this market. If we didn’t believe that tomorrow would be brighter than today, we would not be taking the exposure to the private sector [that we are taking]. By taking private sector exposure, we are saying “I would rather take the upside of the private sector than the fixed return I can get on sovereign risk.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>How does the risk of private sector exposure correlate with your strategy for seeking growth?</strong></p>
<p>Going to a restaurant, hospital, clinic and retailer [as their lender] is saying that I am investing in the goodwill of all these operations and in their relationship with me. When [these businesses] are going to be bigger and more successful, I will grow [with them] because I have taken the risk in the bad days. It makes sense to us because we believe that there is an upside to the market. Lebanon can only [go up] in the future and the private sector is going to benefit from many things. We believe in this economy and the people that are the talent and the resource. As a bank you have to have the right morality vis-à-vis the client and the right productivity to reply to his needs. If you have those two, then you have a success.</p>

However, the factors underlying the market movements remained unchanged: Influences of MSCI classification drove three markets in the Gulf while political developments ruled in Egypt. On the weekly balance, four MENA exchanges were flat, six were up and two dropped.</p>
<p><strong>Egypt’s election<br></strong></p>
<p>The Egyptian Exchange traded up at the start of the week and reached a new post-Arab Spring high intraday on Monday before retreating. After the market closed on Tuesday, the EGX 30 weakened further on Wednesday while the predicted presidential win of former army leader Abdel Fattah al-Sisi was sealed on an unplanned third day of voting. Indications such as provision of free public transport on that day and threats of fines for non-voters suggested that the voting period was extended in order to increase participation and strengthen the appearance of legitimacy of Sisi’s mandate.</p>
<p>With Sisi’s win, the EGX 30 started Thursday with gains but then reversed, ending the day with a 3.5 percent drop due to news that the cabinet was preparing to levy a 10 percent capital gains tax on stock market investors. <a href="http://af.reuters.com/article/egyptMarketNews/idAFL6N0OF3E220140529?sp=true" target="_blank">Media reports</a> on Thursday gave the impression that the information arrived out of the blue, first spread in local media and then confirmed by finance minister Hany Dimian in an interview with Reuters.</p>
<p>The same day, the Egyptian Exchange posted an announcement it attributed to the finance ministry. The <a href="http://www.egx.com.eg/english/NewsDetails.aspx?NewsID=127360" target="_blank">one-sentence statement</a> said “Reference [sic] to what has been circulated about imposing taxes on capital gains achieved in the Egyptian Exchange, ministry of finance confirmed that the calculation of the tax on profits will be on the net value of the market capitalization portfolio by the end of year, compared to its value at the date of approving that law regardless of the purchase date preceding this law, taking into consideration to relay any losses achieved by the investor for the coming 3 years.”</p>
<p>Curiously, attempts to introduce a capital gains tax first on initial public offerings and then on incomes from share sales were twice announced and dropped in Egypt’s recent past — in December 2012 and March 2013 — both by the government of former President Mohammed Morsi.</p>
<p>Investors in the Egyptian bourse were confused and outraged by the latest tax announcement as much as by the announcement’s disorganized presentation and timing on the day when expectations were focused on the outcome of presidential elections. On June 1, the Egyptian Exchange was still in upheaval and trading was suspended from 11:20 am until 11:45 am. By market close at 2:30 pm the EGX 30 was nonetheless down 4.2 percent for the day.</p>
<p><strong>MSCIng the thrills</strong></p>
<p>Compared with the drama on the Cairo financial scene, the market movements in the rest of North Africa and the Levant could not fascinate. The Moroccan, Tunisian and Jordanian markets each fluctuated by less than 2 percent to the downside, but all three recouped that ground and closed the review period flat when compared with the end of the week prior.</p>
<p>The Beirut Stock Exchange, however, ended a period of small index movements with a 20 points gain on May 29–30, which looked to be the biggest two-day rise in the BLOM Index since mid-January. According to the BSE Bulletin, Bank Audi and Solidere were the key gainers on each of the two days. Daily gains ranged from 1.3 percent to 2.2 percent for the two share classes of the real estate company. Bank Audi GDRs rose 3.1 percent on May 29 and the bank’s common shares advanced 3.8 percent the following day.</p>
<p>Massive trading volumes drove the markets in Qatar and the United Arab Emirates on May’s last trading day as the much discussed MSCI Emerging Markets index’s inclusion of 19 stocks from across the three markets triggered share buying by international funds. This drove the ADX General Index 6.6 percent higher on the week, followed by gains of 5.3 percent in Qatar and 4.6 percent in Dubai. The QE Index’s rise brought it to a new all-time high.</p>
<p><strong>Passive activity</strong></p>
<p>Index tracking or ‘passive’ funds hold stock portfolios whose composition mirrors that of an index. When compared with active funds, whose managers pick stocks based on a fund’s respective criteria and buy and sell shares according to their own research, passive funds offer investors much lower operating costs.</p>
<p>One can think of passive funds as financial markets’ equivalent of Carrefour and Walmart, while active funds are akin to Neiman Marcus or Harrods. Active funds will dote on investors with a taste for tailored products in exchange for a hefty fee, but in terms of value for cost, the passive funds occasionally deliver more.</p>
<p>As May 29 was the first day for passive funds to compulsively adjust their portfolios in accordance with the revised MSCI EM index composition, their demand pushed share prices for 12 out of the 19 index entrants from the UAE and Qatar up by more than five percent each. However, the market dynamics also saw stocks go up which were not part of the MSCI selection.</p>
<p>In Abu Dhabi, eleven companies rose by between five percent and the daily limit of 15 percent on Thursday, of which four were driven higher by the MSCI EM siren song. These four were National Bank of Abu Dhabi, Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank, First Gulf Bank and Aldar. NBAD, which experienced extreme demand when compared with its average trading volumes, and ADCB rose at the upper limit; Aldar and FGB respectively gained 7.3 percent and 5.6 percent. The seven other ADX gainers of more than 5 percent included one bank, one insurer, two agricultural firms, a construction materials company, a services company and the cross-listed Qatari telco Ooredoo, which is an entrant to the EM index.</p>
<p>On the Qatar Exchange, however, Ooredoo was only a small gainer on Thursday, moving up just 0.6 percent. In Doha, the companies with share price gains of more than 5 percent each included MSCI EM entrants Vodafone, Barwa, Al Rayan Bank and Qatar Islamic Bank. Of the six other Qatari entrants, including Ooredoo, three saw their share prices go up while three dropped. Elsewhere on the QE, the Qatar National Cement Company’s 6.4 percent gain made it the one strong riser that was not part of the MSCI selection.</p>
<p>On the Dubai Financial Market, some of the EM debutants showed strong gains, as did several others. Emaar Properties and Arabtec pushed 7.2 and 6.3 percent higher while Dubai Islamic Bank added 6.2 percent. The one stock in Dubai to climb at the daily limit was the stock market operator, DFMCO. Outside of the debutant group, Ajman Bank gained 7.1 percent, Dubai Investment Co 5.8 percent and Shuaa Capital 9.6 percent.</p>
<p>Gulf media cited both analysts and research into behavior of reclassified markets to caution that the passive funds — in comparison to active funds’ far smaller assets under management — must not be expected to inject further massive amounts into the UAE and Qatari markets and that post-upgrade, further gains in the markets should not be speculated on.</p>
<p>Of the four other GCC markets, Oman’s MSM 30 was the strongest gainer with 1.7 percent, followed by Tadawul with 0.7 percent. The Bahraini bourse index was flat and the KSE Index gave up 0.8 percent in a trading week that was cut one day short.</p>

Last year, <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/09/01/us-hsbc-mideast-idUSBRE98005D20130901" target="_blank">HSBC reported</a> that they were to discontinue any sale of their investment and wealth management products in Lebanon as part of their global strategy to exit their less profitable branches. Similarly, the recent bidding process between local banks over who will acquire Standard Chartered’s retail banking operations is nearing completion, according to a source close to Standard Chartered. Most recently, <a href="http://www.dailystar.com.lb/Business/Lebanon/2014/May-14/256339-fransabank-to-acquire-local-ahli-interests.ashx#axzz33SyUk6al" target="_blank">reports emerged</a> that Lebanese franchise of Jordanian-owned Ahli International will be acquired by the Lebanese Fransabank.</p>

<p>Lebanon has witnessed many waves of international banks exiting the market since its pre-civil war glory days where it enjoyed the status of being the banking hub of the Middle East. Many banks left during the civil war only to be re-established after it ended. But recent cases of banks exiting or divesting from Lebanon raise the question of what would motivate an international bank to maintain a presence in Lebanon.</p>
<p><b>Both local and strategic</b></p>
<p>Despite recent exits, the decision of these international banks to stay or leave the country doesn’t depend entirely on the Lebanese environment for banking. Their overarching corporate strategy is a large determinant in whether or not these continued operations make sense.</p>
<div><a href="http://www.executive-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/CITI_Elissar-Farah-Antonios.jpg"><img src="http://www.executive-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/CITI_Elissar-Farah-Antonios.jpg" alt="Citi's managing director Elissar Farah Antonios" width="1000" height="750"></a><p>Citi’s managing director Elissar Farah Antonios</p></div>
<p>In the case of the Lebanese unit of global financial group Citi, managing director Elissar Farah Antonios explains that having a far-reaching global presence is one of the bank’s top priorities. “This is something that we’re not going to change as a strategy, not only for Lebanon but globally,” she says, claiming that Citigroup’s presence in roughly 160 countries includes some that have much more challenging economies than Lebanon.</p>
<p>Registered locally as Citibank, the group first came to Lebanon in the 1950s, where its Beirut office used to be the hub for the region, explains Farah Antonios. Though they were forced to leave during the civil war, they re-established the branch in 1996.</p>
<p>Farah Antonios describes Citi’s presence in Lebanon as “part of our global footprint.” She adds, “As long as it makes sense for us to be doing business in the country … as long as we can run our business with an acceptable efficiency ratio, we’re going to be here.”</p>
<p>Citi is determined to stay in Lebanon and Farah Antonios sees no reason why they would want to leave any time soon. She claims that the branch has an efficiency ratio of 38 percent, meaning for every dollar made it costs 38 cents. “It does very much justify us being here,” she adds.</p>
<div><p>As few foreign banks are left in Lebanon, they remain one of international companies’ few options to be serviced by a bank with a large global presence</p>
</div>
<p>Citibank’s asset growth affirms the commitment of the parent company of maintaining a branch in Lebanon. Their assets for 2010, 2011 and 2012 grew to $174.1 million, $180.8 million and $207.2 million, respectively, according to Bankdata. This constituted an increase of 3.7 percent between 2010 and 2011 and 12.7 percent between 2011 and 2012. Citibank claims that their assets increased a further 43 percent between 2012 and 2013, but this could not yet be verified by Bankdata.</p>
<p>In 2013, Citigroup made $13.7 billion in profits worldwide, its largest take since the 2007–2008 financial crisis, according to its annual report.</p>
<p>When it comes to Lebanon, Farah Antonios explains that the country represents added value for their institutional client group — international clients who would bank with Citi anywhere in the world. This institutional client group includes financial institutions, large corporations and governments. According to Farah Antonios, Citi’s main activities in Lebanon include acting as a US dollar correspondent, performing transactions abroad on behalf of Lebanese banks and financial institutions, servicing Lebanese businesspeople who do business outside of Lebanon, as well as servicing the public sector — a very active business ever since the Ministry of Finance launched its Eurobonds.</p>
<p>In addition, Farah Antonios explains that the branch plays an important role acting as “ambassadors” of Citi, whereby if a client requests a product or service not available locally, they can outsource it to the bank’s regional headquarters in London. “We’re only 30–40 employees, so we clearly don’t cover all the products that Citi has.”</p>
<p>Though Beirut is no longer Citi’s main hub for the region, they still see it as an important foothold. “We’ve lost some global clients to Dubai, but it still justifies servicing out of Beirut,” says Farah Antonios.</p>
<p>As few foreign banks are left in Lebanon, they remain one of international companies’ few options to be serviced by a bank with a large global presence.</p>

He is proud to have brought the little Italian restaurant across the Mediterranean to Beirut.</p>
<p>Bou Chaaya, who has a background in hospitality and event planning in Qatar, had always planned to open his own venue in his home city, Beirut. On a business trip to Italy, he visited La Traviata by chance and fell in love with its authenticity, immediately deciding that it should be the restaurant through which he realizes his plan.</p>
<p>After some initial research revealed that La Traviata was ranked number one among Bologna’s 360 restaurants on the travel website Trip Advisor, Bou Chaaya was even more convinced of his choice, and he decided to approach the family with the idea of franchising a branch in Lebanon. The matron, Manuela Sabbatino, was easily swayed.“They were happy that someone was interested in expanding their business [even] before knowing my background and what I could provide them with,” he says.</p>
<p>So began a two year stint in La Traviata’s kitchen where Bou Chaaya — who says his knowledge in the kitchen was lacking — learned all of Sabbatino’s recipes, the way she thinks before cooking and how to choose and find the best ingredients. “I needed to know every aspect of the kitchen so I am not affected if a chef decides to leave,” he says, adding that this is the basis of the restaurant business, especially in Lebanon.</p>
<p>With his training complete, Bou Chaaya entered with the family as a 15 percent shareholder in La Traviata Bologna and vice versa. “This was to ensure good faith, coordination and communication,” explains Bou Chaaya. Even today, the two shareholders start their day with email communications deciding on new recipe ideas or ingredients.</p>
<p>Nestled on a corner of Gemmayze’s Pasteur Street, La Traviata’s investment size was close to $400,000. Bou Chaaya admits that the price tag was steep but says no expense was spared in recreating the spirit of the original venue without falling victim to duplicating it exactly and appearing fake. “I even got the tiles on the bar from Italy,” he says.</p>
<p>With a maximum seating capacity of 55 customers when its exterior and interior are combined, La Traviata is indeed a cozy eatery. The outdoor seating area, on the sidewalk under the venue’s red awnings and next to various plants, is reminiscent of Europe’s chic sidewalk cafes even if a little too exposed to Beirut’s honking cars and traffic.</p>
<p><strong><span>An authentic italian experience</span></strong></p>
<p>Designed by Lebanese architectural company C-Lab, the interior is charming and indeed no detail, from the classical Italian music playing in the background to the choice of dainty yet simple cutlery used, is spared to create an authentic Italian experience for the customer. The walls are adorned with black and white reprints of people eating strings of pasta in different manners — the same reprints are found in Bologna’s La Traviata — and a large wall painting of a family portrait. To the back of the venue is a red window frame around a TV screen depicting the exact view enjoyed by those sitting in Bologna which changes with the weather and passage of time.</p>
<p>But the highlight of La Traviata is the food, which Bou Chaaya, just like Sabbatino, prepares from scratch on a daily basis. Bou Chaaya explains that he does not have any dry pasta or machinery but prepares and cuts the pasta by hand which is why the menu features only tagliatelle, ravioli and tortellini — three kinds of pasta which don’t need to be machine cut.</p>
<p>La Traviata only has service fridges and no storage space, meaning nothing can be kept for the next day. Leftovers are given to the staff at the end of the day. Bou Chaaya sees this as both a blessing, since it means his food is always fresh, and a curse, as it leads to a higher cost.</p>
<p>“I believe it is not how you cook, but what you buy which makes a good dish; a basic recipe with quality ingredients can be amazing,” says Bou Chaaya, who imports all his main ingredients (except for the olive oil) from Italy either directly or through wholesalers for larger quantities.</p>
<p>Though the recipes were quite simple, the freshness and quality of the ingredients could be tasted with every bite. The meal started off with a selection of Italian wine from the wide, yet affordable, list provided and a complimentary platter of granular Reggiano parmesan cheese and mortadella chunks served with bread.</p>
<p>The bacon wrapped mozzarella cheese we ordered for appetizers was an interesting blend of sour from the balsamic dressing and salty from the melting cheese. As for our ravioli and tortellini main courses, which came highly recommended from our friendly and well-informed waiter, they were perfectly al dente. The right amount of cheese was used in the stuffing so as not to hide the pasta’s taste.</p>
<p>We finished off our meal with strong espressos made from coffee beans that Bou Chaaya imports from an Italian family who make their own special blend.</p>
<p>The total bill was $60, making it an affordable place for the quality it offers.</p>
<p><strong><span>Verdi bright future</span></strong></p>
<p>La Traviata currently has an average daily turnover of 65 customers but Bou Chaaya, who has until now relied on word of mouth for promotion, is about to start a social media marketing campaign in an attempt to increase that number. “I wanted it to be the kind of place one discovers alone, but I need to increase the turnover. It’s a business after all,” he says, adding that he hopes to recoup his investment in three years.</p>
<p>Though Bou Chaaya claims to enjoy the competition with other Italian venues in Lebanon, he says all hospitality venues in the country are competing with each other for a very narrow market of people who go out. He is considering expanding the concept to Abu Dhabi, which has lower rents and less competition than Dubai.</p>
<p>As for Lebanon, Bou Chaaya is not done yet. He hopes to one day open a seaside venue outside of Beirut that will appeal to customers in the summer.</p>

He is also the chief financial officer of Audi Group, Odea’s parent. Most importantly, he is the personification of strategy at Lebanon’s largest banking group. Executive asked him what Audi Group has on its mind.   </em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>You have told us that Odeabank has achieved 110 percent expansion in both the number of customers and new accounts in the first quarter of 2014. How did this unexpectedly high growth impact your targets? Can you tell us what</b><b> you are aiming for within 2014 and by the end of 2015?</b></p>
<p>We have a very ambitious business plan. Unfortunately I cannot disclose details because we are listed in London. That means we have legal liabilities and we have developed an ethics [code] to be in full compliance with LSE regulations. So let me put it differently: Our aim is to develop a subsidiary in Turkey which will rank second to [our operation in] Lebanon in the foreseeable future — so not talking long-term — in terms of assets and earnings.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>When do you expect to achieve positive results in the Odeabank income statement?</b></p>
<p>We have reached a stage where in Q1 2014 we have for the first time a balanced monthly P&L [profit and loss statement] before provisioning. In the second step we have to reach a balanced P&L including provisioning and taxes, and then start building the profit base and grow exponentially to achieve our RoE [return on equity] targets.</p>
<div><p>We are the largest contributor to GDP formation; we generate 1.8 percent of Lebanon’s GDP and we are the largest financier to the domestic economy.</p>
</div>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Can you discuss the Odeabank RoE targets for 2015?</b></p>
<p>No. In principle our strategy in all markets where we are present is to achieve a sustainable RoE at a premium [against] the country’s cost of equity in order to create value to our shareholders. We have the same target in Turkey.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>The next stop on the Bank Audi growth tour is to launch in Iraq. What is the group’s target for Iraq?</b></p>
<p>Iraq fits within the same scheme [as our move into Turkey] because 25 percent of trade turnover between Turkey and the Arab world is with Iraq. Our decision to expand quickly into Iraq is within our regional expansion strategy but also to help Odea acquire Turkish companies involved in business with Iraq as clients.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Would it be possible for the group to extend services into Turkish–Iranian trade via Odeabank?</b></p>
<p>We belong to the Arab World and this is why we look at Turkey. We won’t go to a third country [merely] because it has good trade relations with Turkey. But to give you an honest answer, we are developing more and more curiosity toward Iran. But this is not a short-term interest.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Would you be interested in acquiring any bank in the Lebanese market?</b></p>
<p>I am giving you a conceptual answer which has nothing to do with the reality of the bank: We might consider a mega-merger because any combination among the top ten would make a lot of sense in terms of business and financial synergies — but for the time being, this is something that is not supported by the central bank.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Haven’t you attempted to undertake a mega-merger with a top Lebanese bank before? Why would this be something for you to think about, even in the long term? </b></p>
<p>We have tried domestically and regionally, and domestically we tried with almost all of [the other banks]. We believe in synergies and we believe that a mega-merger would provide the country with a lot of advantages by promoting a Lebanese bank into the top five to ten regional banks, something that is not negligible for Lebanon. This would also translate into more involvement domestically, although we are already very happy about our level of involvement. Do you know that we are the largest private sector employer and the largest taxpayer in Lebanon? We are the largest contributor to GDP formation; we generate 1.8 percent of Lebanon’s GDP and we are the largest financier to the domestic economy. We are very proud of our economic and social role in Lebanon, but we still believe that consolidation can provide [advantages].</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Wouldn’t a mega-merger with your involvement create a monopoly power?</b></p>
<p>I don’t look at it as a monopoly. In my opinion you can tolerate a mega-merger by providing restrictions and rules.</p>

<p>Without studying the fine print, consumers rush to rack up points on their cards, pushing themselves to spend more under the conviction that they are getting back what they spent. However, loyalty programs seem to promise the world, but actually offer considerably less.</p>
<p>What started as airline miles collection in exchange for spending on payment cards rapidly mushroomed into the intricate rewards programs that are offered by the majority of Lebanon’s banks today. “Because all banks have some form of these programs, it becomes almost a defensive action to have them — we can’t afford to not have them,” says Anthony Ussher, e-banking division head at Credit Libanais. Another benefit of reward programs for banks is that they encourage clients to open new accounts while gaining customer loyalty through the perks offered.</p>
<p><strong>Delayed gratification</strong></p>
<p>Rewards offered vary from bank to bank but generally fall into the following broad categories: tangible rewards such as electronics or fashion items, experiential rewards such as travel miles or packages, actual cash automatically added to your account and bank services such as credit card activation or insurance premium payment. According to Ussher, 50 percent of Credit Libanais clients redeem their points for travel; 20 percent opt for bank services and insurance premiums; and the remaining 30 exchange them for gifts.</p>
<div><p>Cash back programs give clients approximately $10 back for each $1,000 they spend, a theoretical 1 percent return.</p>
</div>
<p>Accumulating points for any type of reward requires that clients use their debit, credit or online card extensively as they receive between 1 and 10 points for each dollar spent, depending on the bank and card used, while redeeming them requires a high number of points for a comparatively lesser value reward. Receiving a free iPhone 5S from Bank Audi would require a customer spend more than $210,000 while a ticket to Larnaca would translate into $22,500. Cash back programs give clients approximately $10 back for each $1,000 they spend, a theoretical 1 percent return.</p>
<p>According to Laurence Leigh, professor of marketing at AUB, marketers of reward programs make their rewards more valuable at the highest levels of point accumulation. “If you have 2,500 points you get a miserable reward, but if you get 50,000, the value goes up exponentially — if you get 500,000 you get a trip around the world let’s say. So, many people hold off redeeming their points in hopes of that big gift and end up not using them,” says Leigh. Given that points have an average expiration date of three years, people aspire for the big rewards but end up with smaller ones.</p>
<p><strong>Scheming for loyalty </strong></p>
<p>Credit Libanais’ Ussher says that since the bank makes little money off each payment card transaction, it cannot afford to value its rewards any lower and often relies on their subsidiaries, such as insurance companies or travel agencies, to be able to offer the rewards.</p>
<p>Keeping in mind that consumers are essentially getting back very little in comparison to what they spend, it is a wonder that banks say these programs bring them added business.</p>
<div><p>Rewards schemes will compete and adapt in order to keep customer interest high. </p>
</div>
<p>“Any loyalty scheme is designed in such a way that encourages you to consistently use one particular card. This is playing on consumer psychology where people like the idea that they are getting something for nothing: a gift they will value sometime in the future,” says Leigh, explaining that this falls under the branch of behavioral economics where people don’t necessarily act in the way that a rational economic person should and instead do things which are difficult to fit into the standard microeconomic model. They feel happy with the thought of receiving a gift and forget its actual worth compared to what they spent.</p>
<p>Leigh suggests an alternative to payment card usage when it comes to large purchases: “What would be a more rational thing to do would be to ask the vendor if he would give you a discount for using cash instead of plastic. The cash discount you would get this way would almost certainly be more valuable than the reward.”</p>
<p>Yet consumers still dream of the big free gift, and loyalty programs are here to stay. Rewards schemes will compete and adapt in order to keep customer interest high. Ussher suggests the way forward for loyalty programs is for banks to coordinate with merchants who have greater margins for advertising. With both of them working together, banks can offer consumers double points on certain occasions or merchants can offer them discounted items during low seasons.</p>
<p>Another idea that Credit Libanais is considering is to have instant small rewards — such as a free ice-cream — through the point-of-sale receipts, which again plays on consumer behavior, encouraging them to use their cards more.</p>
<p>“A lot of it is psychology but psychology works and keeps people loyal,” says Leigh.</p>

It goes by the name of Odeabank. Odea is apparently not a Turkish word but a brand name chosen because using the family name-based Audi brand would have collided with the four-ringed German car maker’s rights. But look how the kid has grown.</p>
<p>Assets of $8.8 billion, customer deposits of $7 billion and loans of $6 billion were the cornerstone figures for Odeabank at the end of March 2014. That compares to a practically blank slate for a balance sheet with assets of $300 million in the form of the bank’s capital when management threw open the doors of the first branch in November 2012.</p>
<p>This growth was far beyond anything that Audi had anticipated, says Freddie Baz, the chief financial officer and strategy director of Bank Audi. “If you had asked me in mid-2012, ‘What are your prospects for asset growth two years down the road?’ I would never have told you $8 billion because I couldn’t have imagined that we could achieve this figure,” Baz tells Executive.</p>
<div><p>The growth was far beyond anything that Audi had anticipated</p>
</div>
<p>Similarly, Odeabank General Manager Hüseyin Özkaya was cited by media reports from early 2013 [The Banker Magazine Feb 2013] as saying that the bank was aiming to become one of Turkey’s top 15 banks by 2017. But a year later, this growth target was no longer valid because the bank’s balance sheet at end 2013 already put it into 14th rank among the country’s 49 banks.</p>
<p>While Baz declines to publicly cite the number of Odeabank account and card holders at end of the first quarter 2014, he puts the growth of the customer base as 110 percent in just this quarter, and not from a low base but a solid five-digit number of account holders that the bank had accumulated as its customer base by end of last year. Similarly, the number of issued cards had almost doubled in the first quarter of this year versus the number at year-end 2013.</p>
<p>These growth metrics are more important in demonstrating the new bank’s future earnings potential than the figures for assets and deposits, Baz says. “Your franchise at the end of the day is the number of customers you have, the number of accounts you have, [and] the number of credit cards you are issuing. We are on the right track to build a solid franchise, a stable franchise [and] a growing franchise. The rest will come.”</p>
<p><strong><span>Successful rollout</span></strong></p>
<p>The first-year expansion experience of Odeabank is based on Audi Group investing $1.1 billion into the unit. This entailed the rollout of a branch network of 37 outlets, the implementation of high-grade systems and usage of a substantial war chest to acquire top hires from the Turkish banking sector.</p>
<p>Odeabank’s growth also deserves to be seen in context of its national economic and banking environment. According to Turkey’s Banking Regulation and Supervision Agency (Bankacılık Düzenleme Ve Denetleme Kurulu or BDDK) unconfirmed total banking sector assets grew 31.2 percent between January 2013 and 2014 to TRY 1.79 trillion ($861.8 billion). The sector’s one-year growth rates for deposits and loans were equally impressive, at 24.8 percent and 34.8 percent.</p>
<p>The expansion of Odeabank’s assets, deposits and loans in 2013 were multiples of sector growth rates but, starting from a low position at the end of 2012, looks a bit less extravagant when put in perspective of the overall expansionary banking sector data.</p>
<p>A second factor for consideration is Turkey’s economic profile. The World Bank says Turkey’s GDP reached $789.3 billion in 2012 on its country data page. Per capita gross national income of $10,830 in 2012 is not too far ahead of Lebanon’s $9,190 but the Turkish figure correlates with a population size of an estimated 74 million to constitute an economy that is marked by huge potential and the ambition to become one of the world’s ten largest economies by 2023.</p>
<p>This market size alone is worth an expansion effort for a Lebanese banking group with strong financial and development capabilities. Lebanese equity analyst Nadim Kabbara, who covers Bank Audi under his remit as head of research for FFA Private Bank, says that in hypothetical terms, the 20-times larger Turkish GDP when compared with Lebanon would give Bank Audi a loan portfolio representing “perhaps one fifth of Bank Audi’s balance sheet right there,” if the group captures just 1 percent of an assumed $600 to $700 billion loan market in an $800 billion economy with high loans-to-deposits ratios.</p>
<p>But assumptions are assumptions and then reality offers challenges. The Turkish growth story of the past decade began to stutter quite heftily in 2013, and the Turkish lira had a really bad time. Critics of the Turkish success scenario say that credit and property bubbles have been building up and predict busts of these bubbles and rising rates of defaults in the economy.</p>
<p>According to an April 2014 Economic Outlook by the Turkish Ministry of Economy, the World Bank’s GDP growth forecasts for the country are 2.4 and 3.5 percent, respectively, for 2014 and 2015. However, the Turkish government aims at 4 percent GDP growth this year and 5 percent next year and also seeks to improve the ratio of current account balance to GDP from -7.9 percent in 2013 to -5.9 percent in 2015.</p>
<p>Even if Ankara will be able to manage the disruptions of the country’s political stability and perhaps deflect accusations of corruption as propaganda, Turkey’s economic agenda appears to require a lot of structural adjustments. The World Bank said last month that Turkey needs to increase its market share in global trade if it wants to reach long-term export targets. Key to such improvements would be “a policy agenda that is centered on upgrading Turkey’s physical, human and institutional capital.”</p>
<p><strong>Entry strategy</strong></p>
<p>But this World Bank advice on Turkey’s trade growth strategy might actually be water on the mills of Audi Group, because of its original motivation for entering the Turkish market. In talking Executive through the short history of Odea, Baz emphasizes that the project to establish Bank Audi’s presence in Turkey was not initiated in response to the market turmoils that the two group units experienced in Egypt and Syria starting with the Arab Spring and anti-government protests in 2011 and 2012.</p>
<p>“There is a misunderstanding that Audi went to Turkey to mitigate the rising challenges in the Arab World,” Baz says. “[The decision] was within our regional expansion strategy which aimed at a strategic footprint with respect to the exponentially growing trade, financial and human flows between Turkey and the Arab world that we witnessed at that time. You cannot be a regional player without having a footprint in Turkey and the decision was taken before the first quarter in 2011.”</p>
<div><p>“There is a misunderstanding that Audi went to Turkey to mitigate the rising challenges in the Arab World” </p>
</div>
<p><span>The basic calculation was to conquer a share of growing trade finance business between Turkey and the Arab world, which according to Baz reached $50 billion annually in 2013. “Initially from our standpoint as shareholders, our case was built on very solid assumptions of basic economic synergies between Turkey and the Arab world. If we can get 10 percent market share of Arab-Turkish trade-related business, [this means] $50 million in yearly commissions and if we can go up to 15 percent, it is $75 million,” he says.</span></p>
<p>As such, Odeabank was a child of reason, not emotion; its conception was carefully planned and benefited from an unexpected opportunity, namely the fact that top BDDK officials encouraged Audi Group in 2010 to apply for a new Turkish banking license. This was unexpected by Audi strategists because no new licenses had been granted in Turkey since the days when the country plunged into a series of economic and currency stress phases between 1996 and 2001.</p>
<p>When the group started its search for an entry point into the Turkish market in the mid 2000s, it concentrated its efforts on an entry by acquisition but aborted negotiations with several banks due to the high premiums demanded by prospective sellers.</p>
<p>The opportunity to install a subsidiary from scratch was more than a viable alternative to buying an existing franchise ­— it was far superior because of cost advantages. According to Baz, once the smooth one-year process for application review and license issuance was completed, the next part of the story entailed “no mysteries, no miracles, just strong underlying realities. The main difference between acquiring and getting a license is that when you succeed in getting a license, you are spared the goodwill that you normally pay when you acquire. This goodwill in Turkey easily corresponds to 50 percent of the capital of the acquired institution.”</p>
<p>In other words, Baz views the cost differential between the group’s $1.1 billion investment into Odeabank and the price which Bank Audi would have had to pay for an acquisition of a comparable bank as $500 million — money which can be spent better than handing it over to a seller.</p>
<p><strong><span>Local talent</span></strong></p>
<p>According to Baz, this meant that Audi Group could focus on people. “When you can start a business in a new market without incurring any goodwill expense, this provides you with great flexibility in buying talent and allows you to be very competitive in buying the best people in the market.”</p>
<p>The management profiles in Odeabank’s annual report show that the bank’s general manager, Hüseyin Özkaya, has behind him a career of more than 20 years in Turkish banking, mostly with units of HSBC, and was the global bank’s country manager in Russia between 2010 and 2012. He is working with a team of nine assistant general managers who all have backgrounds in high-profile banks, both domestically owned and Turkish units of internationals such as HSBC, ING and BNP Paribas.</p>
<div><p>“Bank Audi did the right thing in who they hired in Turkey … targeting senior management who would bring in their teams”</p>
</div>
<p>In FFA Bank’s Kabbara’s view, “Bank Audi did the right thing in who they hired in Turkey and in their strategic focus. Comparing with some banks from the Gulf which paid premiums to enter the Turkish markets via acquisitions and who perhaps moved people in who were not cognizant of all risks and circumstances, Audi did some things differently as they built Odeabank from scratch and hired [local] talent — targeting senior management who would bring in their teams.”</p>
<p>In light of the advantage of being a “greenfield” bank, Baz says that the negative bottom line of the first two years of operation, which incurs in both a startup and an acquisition scenario, amounts to $44 million for Odeabank, “well below whatever goodwill we would have paid to acquire an existing bank of the same size.”</p>
<p>He also is not overly worried about the economic challenges that Turkey has started to face in 2013, including the impact that the depreciation of the Turkish lira had on Bank Audi’s financial results. According to him, the size of the negative currency valuation impact moved down from $90 million at the most dire exchange rate to about $50 million at the time of his interview with Executive in May.</p>
<p>The uncertainty over the development of the Turkish economy is not affecting the group’s positive medium-term view on the market, he adds, “but we aim to avoid shocks and pains in the short term.” This, he concedes, “is frustrating for our management there who believe that despite the current environment they can achieve much higher growth.”</p>
<p>When compared with the concerns over the short-term economic outlook, the bigger change in the group’s approach to the Turkish market originated in the hunger of Odeabank’s management team to build a domestic franchise. Bringing their existing relationships with corporate and commercial clients with them, the managers attracted domestic account holders and loan clients, says Baz. “We are building a Turkish franchise thanks to the team there. However, our managers there also like the idea for Audi to become the best Middle Eastern bank in Turkey; so they also want to develop a franchise covering either Middle Eastern corporations established in Turkey or Turkish corporations engaged in business with the Arab world.”</p>
<p>While Odeabank added marketing bells with direct banking services and branding whistles through sponsorship of the women’s basketball team of Istanbul sports club Galatasaray, Baz says that the main focal areas of the bank will be in serving the corporate and commercial segments of the market: “Our ultimate aim is not mass retail. In 80 percent of our network [development] we are driven mainly by business sensitive to our brand.”</p>
<p>For the further growth of Bank Audi into an even bigger regional bank, the group aims to employ a new team of Turkish bankers at its head office in Beirut. “We have an aim to recruit a group of Turkish bankers, mainly corporate and commercial bankers, who will be domiciliated in Lebanon under a group dimension,” says Baz.</p>
<p>Visibility is a key objective for Odeabank and on the day of our interview, the bank’s name certainly received another boost. The Galatasaray Odeabank women’s basketball team won the Turkish League Championship after a 13-year wait and the International Basketball Federation congratulated them on the “most productive season in their history,” which also included the first-ever win of the EuroLeague Women’s title by a Turkish team.</p>

It is also the main lobbying organization for banking interests, responding harshly to proposals for higher taxation of banks and calling such moves “illegitimate” and discriminatory. Executive sat down to talk banking with Makram Sader, the ABL secretary general. </i></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>When the Parliament in April began debating proposals for new taxation on banks to fund the salary scale for teachers and public servants, ABL quickly rejected these concepts. The public discussions of the proposals and ABL’s position have been intense since then. Has the association changed its position in any way?</b></p>
<p>We said that it is unfair to impose double taxation on the banking industry, penalizing this industry because we are very transparent and publish all statements of P&L [profit and loss] and all our accounts under international accounting standards as we are obliged to do. For us [the proposed tax on net revenues from treasury bills] is double taxation because you are taxing the same income twice, at the level of P&L and on the bottom line via corporate tax on profits.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Did you undertake any studies on the question of how a general increase in corporate taxation would affect banks and everyone in the economy?</b></p>
<p>No. We don’t want to publish anything on this question. The Economic Committees [a lobbying coalition for the private sector] published a very clear statement on this issue and we are part of the Economic Committees.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>But your first objection to the tax increases is the issue of double taxation?</b></p>
<p>For us as the banking industry, yes.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Would you consider a different form of tax increase fair?</b></p>
<p>It is not our business to tell the government where to raise or not raise taxes. We don’t want to enter this game but all we can say is that there is a lot of money to save. There are a lot of [revenue] leaks at Électricité du Liban, at Beirut Port [and] at Beirut Airport. Before putting taxes on any sector or industry, they have to collect all the taxes that can be collected.</p>
<p>We as banks are making about 7 to 10 percent of the profit that the private sector is making in the country, so why are we paying 37 percent of the corporate taxes? There is a lot of money to be collected as long as there is a good administration and an efficient tax collection system.</p>
<p>We are also saying that it is not right to add new taxes on an economy that is not growing. Economically speaking, that is not right. When you don’t have economic growth, you inject money.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>But if we look at the allocation of the taxes that the government is aiming to collect, there is basically a transfer from one side, namely corporate profits, to another side, the public sector salaries. Could one not from a supply side perspective consider this salary scale as an injection of money that could generate private sector growth by stimulating higher consumption?</b></p>
<p>That is a Keynesian theoretical approach. People who speak about this are right if you are in an economic situation with unused production capacity, in an economy without dramatic deficits on the tax income side and on the balance of payments side. But the reality is different; you cannot apply a theoretical economic formula and equation to a very bad economic, political and security situation like in Lebanon.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>In your view, how should the government proceed from this point? Do you have a position or proposal for a revenue formula?</b></p>
<p>Do you think the government does not know how to proceed, that the government and the Ministry of Finance don’t know what to do? But they are always going to facilitate solutions where it is easy for them to take the money from where it is. If you look at the proposed table of receipts [for financing the salary scale increase] you will not find any economic policy behind it. You cannot find any social policy or any public servant policy or any incentives for reform. They were shopping for LL 1,742 billion [$1.15 billion] and they tried to take the money from anywhere they could, without any policy. And while they are trying to increase the tax revenues, they are forgetting completely that we already have a huge public deficit. When you have a public deficit of $4.2 billion, you have to at least give an impression of seriousness to the banking industry and to all the people watching us, such as [international ratings agencies] S&P and Moody’s and the donor countries.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>A parliamentary committee produced a revised salary scale proposal with lower funding needs but without mentioning a new strategy or fundamental policy reforms. From your perspective of emphasizing the need for fundamental reforms and activation of tax collections, are you then saying that it is not the main issue to redefine the scale of the financing need?</b></p>
<p>I am not saying that. From an economic point of view it is much better to go for [roughly] LL 1,800 billion [$1.19 billion] than for LL 3,200 billion [$2.11 billion]. They are reducing the initial proposal by [MP Ibrahim] Kanaan and the financial committee by 47 percent and this is much better.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>So from your perspective, this is a positive development?</b></p>
<p>For sure. I also want to say that I think the public servants deserve a restructuring of their salary scale but at the same time, [the public sector needs] a restructuring of their human resources [such as] restructuring of job descriptions and introduction of job evaluations.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>It seems undeniable that demands of public sector employees and teachers for fair remuneration of their work have to be met. Does ABL have a proposal how the current shortfall in state funding can be overcome and what banks could provide at this particular moment? </b></p>
<p>We are against any specific or mandatory contribution to be imposed on the banking sector just because we are making and publishing profit. It is not fair at all. We are already paying our taxes and we want the others to pay theirs.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>How do you see the economic outlook for Lebanon and the banking industry?</b></p>
<p>The outlook is stable. Like the ratings agencies say, it is sometimes negative and sometimes stable and the B minus ratings [for rated Lebanese banks] are because of the sovereign ceiling. We are living with [these ratings] and they are perhaps obliging us to increase our capital base, which is good for us in the long run. We are now at $14.4 or $14.6 billion in capital funds and this helps us to comply with [international banking regulatory agreement] Basel III.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>If you look at the performance of the Lebanese banking sector, there seems to be something like a concerted approach by the banking industry to emphasize return on average equity [RoAE] instead of highlighting other parameters such as net profits. Why is there so much focus on RoAE?</b></p>
<p>[Lebanese banks] today have a lot of shareholders: resident Lebanese investors, non-resident Lebanese investors and some Arab investors. The investors like to have dividends. When you have opened up your capital, you have to be transparent and the return on average assets and the return on average equity are very important indicators, making it easy to follow and compare with performances from other industries and countries.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Are these return ratios better indicators than other indicators such as the rates of increase in bank deposits?</b></p>
<p>I think so. I don’t like this size approach to banking because we saw huge banks [fall] in international markets. The size is not the [main issue]. In Lebanon we have two main variables to look at. The first one for me is the ratio of liquid assets in foreign currency, because it is very important to cover the unstable Lebanese environment. Whenever there is a war or internal fighting you have to have large international liquid assets to be able to satisfy your clients if they ask to transfer their money outside.</p>
<p>We have therefore always maintained huge liquid assets in foreign currency. It is a huge cost for us because we are keeping this liquidity with international banks and are getting 0.2, 0.3, 0.5, or 0.8 [percent interest] while we are paying on average 2.9 [percent] on the funds. So the liquidity is really a losing business for us; we are losing maybe $400 million or $500 million a year. It is costing us a lot of money during normal periods but it is protecting us in times of crisis.</p>
<p>The other thing is to have good net returns on assets. That means net of our non-performing loans. We don’t have huge ratios of non-performing loans but we have them. You have to make money — we are in the private sector and our aim is to grow our business and create returns for our shareholders.</p>

The bank achieved 20 percent growth in deposits in 2013 to reach $2.3 billion at year-end. This not only facilitated the leap into the alpha group but also put it at the top of the growth charts among the now 14 alpha group banks.</p>
<p>Compared with the peer group’s growth of deposits, Creditbank expanded at more than twice the average percentage rate in 2013, and it also reported the highest growth in assets in percentage terms. The bank’s growth was above 19 percent on both, but it had a head start on percentages because it rose from the lowest absolute figures in the peer group.</p>
<p>Creditbank’s overall shares in alpha group deposits and assets were 1.42 percent and 1.39 percent at the end of 2012 and 1.55 percent and 1.50 percent at year-end 2013. The ‘super alpha’ dogs Audi, Blom, and Byblos controlled around 21, 15, and 10 percent of deposits and assets at the end of last year.</p>
<p>In absolute terms of deposits, Creditbank’s addition of $380,000 in 2013 surpassed the deposits gained by each of the banks in positions 9 to 13 but lagged significantly behind each of the eight largest banks according to sector information compiler Bankdata. But growth of deposits for the sake of greater bragging rights was not on Creditbank’s mind, claims the bank’s chair, Tarek Khalife. Instead, the bank was vying to achieve growth by catering to private sector credit demand.</p>
<p>Lending was the bank’s raison d’être since its founding as Crédit Bancaire in 1981, and implementing an intelligent strategic culture in pursuit of this objective over the past ten years made for “an interesting and rewarding challenge,” says Khalife. He adds that since 2004, Creditbank rose through the banking sector size rankings by 9 or 10 places to its current spot in position 14.</p>
<p>The fruits of this long-term strategy are evidenced in the fact that Creditbank, now for several years running, has the Lebanese market’s highest loans to deposits ratio, at 57 percent at year-end 2013 versus a sector average of less than 40 percent. According to Bankdata, Creditbank’s loans to deposits ratio is more than 10 points above any other alpha group bank. Khalife sees his bank as one of the keenest in accepting private sector risk, mainly competing with two larger but not ‘super alpha’ banks — names he declines to give explicitly.</p>
<p>“Nobody is more risk friendly than us in Lebanon. I would say there are two other banks that are as risk friendly as Creditbank. Everybody else is fighting on another front because they either don’t know how to take the risk or because they can afford not to,” he says.</p>
<p>The second part of his statement refers to the historic pattern of the past 20 years by which many large Lebanese banks focused their attention on financing the needs of the public sector. Describing the approach of most local banks as taking deposits and placing these funds in sovereign instruments such as treasury bills, Khalife says the resulting gap in supply of finance awarded Creditbank its opportunity for expansion: “The private sector was thirsting for a bank that was willing to focus on the financing of the private sector.”</p>
<p><strong>Growth, not profits</strong></p>
<p>With its emphasis on the virtuousness of lending so highly pronounced, Creditbank has at times maintained a lower ratio for primary liquidity to assets than many of its peers. In 2011 it was below 20 percent for this ratio. However, the bank focused on increasing the ratio in 2012 and 2013 and by end of last year it showed 30.12 percent primary liquidity to assets, close to the peer group average of about 31 percent.</p>
<p>Creditbank’s growth strategy prioritized the implementation of technologies in anticipation of customer demands and the creation of an institutional culture that was at times more capacious than warranted by the size of operations. “We have been managing the bank as an institutional player for more than 20 years. We were very small and yet acting as an institutional player,” says Khalife.</p>
<p>During those years, investments into capabilities were top priority and short-term profitability was not a major target, he adds. “We have done a lot to subscribe to consistency and length of vision. Creditbank could have made greater profits, but we would have lost perception of the client and would have lost our branding culture and our capability to grow.”</p>
<p>In practical terms, the bank invested in automated teller machines at a time when it had just a handful of branches and this expenditure on ATMs ate up almost half of that year’s profits. On the side of ownership, the emphasis on the long term meant that the bank parted ways with shareholders who were not willing to forego quick returns.</p>
<p>In the two decades since Khalife has joined the bank that was cofounded by his father, his shareholding first underwent a massive, phased increase from 8 percent in 1992 to 95 percent in 2004. In the past ten years, however, the trajectory reversed. New shareholders came on board and Khalife reduced his stake by more than 30 percentage points to a current majority of just over 50 percent.</p>
<p>The bank’s structural milestones entailed an acquisition, in 2001, of the Lebanese branch of French bank Crédit Lyonnais, and a 2002 name adjustment to Creditbank from the original Crédit Bancaire. According to Khalife, the reasons for the adjustment were legal consolidation under a single name and a tightening of the bank’s appearance. A complete rebranding has been implemented over the past year and is nearing completion, with measures such as furnishing branches for one-to-one customer interactions instead of counter-based traffic.</p>
<p><strong>Beyond the glass ceiling</strong></p>
<p>Creditbank is not currently pursuing new international growth. It scaled up its shareholding in an Armenian entity, Anelik Bank, to full ownership in 2013 from 51 percent acquired four years ago. It also owns a unit in Russia, Anelik RU, which is specialized in the money transfer business.</p>
<p>“I don’t think growth abroad is in our dictionary today,” Khalife says, adding that he sees no attraction in markets with many advanced players, such as Turkey or the Gulf region. However, he seems amenable to someday contemplating opportunities in less developed markets in Central Asia.</p>
<p>Khalife sees Creditbank’s competitive edge in the current economy as residing in its risk culture. He reasons that the experience of extending credit to the private sector gives it an advantage over banks which are switching from a profit culture to a risk culture and thus may have to pay a price for aggressively pushing loans on customers they don’t know well enough.</p>
<p>The bank has been investing in its staff, which includes 15 women among the 38 persons in the top layers of management, and into tech-driven delivery channels, such as mobile banking. The strength of the domestic workforce has reached about 500 persons and an internal training academy is on the agenda, as is a new communications apparatus. All in all, the bank is at a stage in which Khalife regards further growth as a must. “I have to grow the bank because our culture is not one for small entities. It is made and built to be a big bank,” he says.</p>
<p>The perspective correlates well with the Creditbank’s head office location in the Sin El Fil district of greater Beirut — the surrounding streets smack of new commercial developments.</p>
<p>When Khalife leans back in his chair, his eyes can roam high. His office in the top floor of a commercial tower has a glass ceiling and above it is nothing other than the — mostly blue — Lebanese sky. He says Creditbank will increase its growth beyond all previous measure in the next 24 months and he has a very clear view of his position then.</p>
<p>“I have to bring in new capital,” he says. In the process Khalife readily agrees that the future will see dilution of his direct control. “I still have the majority, but I am not going to hold it for long. I can guarantee that the bank will at least double in assets over the course of the next two years and of course I will no longer be the majority holder.”</p>
