<p><span><strong>It’s simple: you have never seen a movie like <em>Boyhood </em>before, and you likely never will again. Shot over a 12-year period with the same cast, Richard Linklater’s latest is the definition of a masterpiece, and it’s hands down the best movie of the year, and one of the most memorable cinematic experiences you will ever have. </strong></span></p>
<p><span>I’m honestly not even sure how I’m supposed to describe the plot, because it genuinely feels like you’re watching real life unfold before your very eyes. The film’s protagonist, Mason (Ellar Coltane) literally grows up on screen, and we watch him deal with life, one moment at a time. It’s mind-blowingly impressive from a technical perspective, but it’s also extremely real and deceptively simple. Again, it’s like watching real life. I’m just going to leave it at that.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://ageeksblogdotcom1.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/boyhood2.jpg"><img src="http://ageeksblogdotcom1.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/boyhood2.jpg?w=650&h=455" alt="boyhood2"></a></p>
<p><span>For one, director Richard Linklater deserves heaps of praise for this meticulously crafted piece of art. Never in my life have I experienced something like this, and it truly is an <em>experience. </em>The performances he manages to get out of these actors, particularly Ellar Coltrane and Lorelei Linklater (who plays Mason’s sister, Samantha) are incredible. They’ve really matured into solid actors.</span></p>
<p><span>I fell in love with how time progresses in <em>Boyhood. </em>Whether it’s a perfectly timed musical cue, pop culture reference, or a shot of one of the young actors now looking a bit older, it just works. The soundtrack is also brilliant and consists of some of my favorite bands, so that’s also a huge plus.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://ageeksblogdotcom1.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/boyhood-4.png"><img src="http://ageeksblogdotcom1.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/boyhood-4.png?w=650&h=349" alt="Boyhood-4"></a></p>
<p><span>Patricia Arquette and Ethan Hawke are perfect as Mason and Samantha’s parents, and their relationship with their kids is a big part of why this film succeeds. You forget that you’re watching a movie and start believing that they’re their actual parents, which comes as a result of Linklater’s amazing 12-year effort to bring this story to life. </span></p>
<p><span>But the movie is so much more than just a sprawling epic that spans half a decade; it’s an extremely personal tale of a young boy finding himself and learning about life. Mason goes from a wide-eyed five-year-old kid to this pensive, often gloomy teenager, and I for one couldn’t help but relate to him and his struggles. In fact, everyone can relate to some part of his life, which makes this movie so damn resonant.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://ageeksblogdotcom1.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/75.jpg"><img src="http://ageeksblogdotcom1.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/75.jpg?w=650&h=455" alt="75"></a></p>
<p><span><em>Boyhood</em> is also extremely funny, and it feels so effortless thanks to the incredible writing and flawless performances. There’s also some great tension, and whenever you think you know where the story is going, it goes in a completely different direction. The film is almost three hours long, yet not one single scene felt unnecessary or indulgent. In fact, I could have easily sat there for another five hours.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>The Verdict:</strong></span></p>
<p><span><em>Boyhood</em> is one of the greatest cinematic achievements of our generation, but don’t take my word for it, experience it for yourself. You’ll be happy you did. It’s a masterpiece in every sense of the word.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Numerical Score: 10/10</strong></span></p>

It took about a couple of hours before the new Airbnb logo would become the ridicule of the design community - much has been read into it: A phallic symobl, check, a widened vagina, check, boobs, check, and the list goes. The fact that is resembles closely two other logos (N3twork and Automation Anywhere) does not help.<br>
Note that this is not the first time a new logo gets a desatrous welcome - Gap suffered major backlash upon releasing theirs, heck, the whole country of Poland also had to retract a new redesigned logo, and (lest we forget) the <a href="http://beirutntsc.blogspot.com/2011/03/are-we-getting-too-carried-away.html">Saudi Arilines</a>.<br>

<p>As <a href="http://blogbaladi.com/im-off-to-jordan/">mentioned</a> previously, I was in Jordan for a week back in May along with a couple of bloggers and media people courtesy of the Jordan Tourism Board. Before talking about the trip, I have to say I am quite impressed by the initiatives taken by Jordan to promote tourism in their country and through the JTB as opposed to what the Tourism Ministry does in Lebanon. </p>
<p>Moving on to the trip itself, and given that it was 1 week long, I thought I divide it into 2 parts:</p>
<p>- <strong>The first post</strong> covering the first 3 days of the trip that includes a short stop and dinner in Amman, the Pope event at Amman stadium, the dead sea and baptism site visits and the stay at the mountain resort Ma’In Hot Springs Evason in Ma’In. </p>
<p>- <strong>The second post</strong> covering the visit to Madaba (Mount Nebo), the desert experience in Wadi Rum, Petra by day and by night experience and last but not least our last stop at Aqaba.</p>

<p>We took an early morning flight from Beirut to Amman (there are 7 flights every day) and got to Amman in less than 2 hours. It was my first time on a Royal Jordanian plane and the trip was quite smooth and the staff were very friendly. Upon arriving to the newly renovated Queen Alia International Airport, a bus and a tourist guide were waiting there to help us out and pick us up. The first hotel we stayed in was the Regency Palace hotel as it was very close to where the Pope’s mass is taking place and to the Jordanian cultural center where all the press conferences were being held.</p>

<p><strong>Night out in Amman and a selfie with Pope Francis</strong><br>
To be honest, the Regency Palace hotel was by far the worst hotel we stayed in during our trip to Amman as the rooms were dirty, the food was average and the hotel was right on a busy highway. After resting for a couple of hours, we headed out to the city center and had dinner at a beautiful authentic restaurant called Sufra. The restaurant is an old renovated house with a beautiful interior and a splendid terrace. The food was also quite good as we got to try few Jordanian dishes which were quite interesting (specially the Kafta wou Batata with T7eené instead of tomatoes). </p>

<p>The second day was quite a busy one as we had to be ready by 10am for the Pope’s visit and we spent the whole day between the Jordanian cultural center and the Amman stadium. The security measures taken were quite drastic as there were 2 or 3 police officers every 20 meters and a lot of security checks. Nevertheless, everything went as planned and I got to see Pope Francis which I admire and respect a lot. I even took a <a href="http://instagram.com/p/oY1JQBNrCV/?modal=true">selfie</a> with him! </p>

<p><strong>The Dead Sea Experience: At the lowest point on Earth</strong><br>
Our next stop after Amman was at the Movenpick Hotels & Resorts which is located on the dead sea. As opposed to Regency Hotel, this was one of the most beautiful resorts I’ve ever been too. The resort was splendid, the rooms were amazing, the food was great and the facilities were everything one would ask for. As far as the dead sea experience is concerned, I went for a swim and it was quite a weird feeling as you float the whole time. I stayed for around 20 minutes as this is the recommended time then put some of that “magic” mud on my body. Note that it is not recommended to swim if you have a cut, nor is it advised to dunk your face in the water as your eyes will hurt real bad; you just have to lay back and navigate with your hands as if you’re in a tube.</p>

<p>The whole dead sea experience took less than an hour and we spent the rest of the day sunbathing and walking around the resort. I even found some private Jacuzzi entrance and managed to get in after one of the hotel employees gave me the pass code. It was one of the best Jacuzzis I’ve stayed in as well. If you ever want to visit the dead sea, there are a lot of cool resorts along the coast just like the Movenpick.</p>

<p><strong>Baptism Site</strong></p>
<p>After leaving the Movenpick and before heading to Ma’In, we passed by the Baptism Site for a short visit. The Baptism Site of Jesus Christ, also known as Al-Maghtas, is one of the most important religious destinations specially for Christians. Despite its symbolism, there’s nothing much to see there except for the few churches and the main site next to the river. </p>

<p>What was quite amazing there is that we were standing right on the Jordan River and the people on the other side of the river were in Israel. Even though we were separated by few meters only and no barriers, no one dares to cross the river from both sides.</p>

<p><strong>Evason Ma’In Hot Springs</strong></p>
<p>After our short stop at the Baptism site, we drove for like an hour to get to Ma’In, a region situated in the mountains and hosting a beautiful resort next to Ma’In’s famous waterfalls. The resort is called Evason Ma’In Hot Springs (I have no idea how we pronounce Evason) and consists of a hotel and a spa, the Six Senses Spa, set underneath one of the three waterfalls found there. </p>
<p>The hotel itself is really nice and ideal for a weekend escape, the rooms were tidy and clean but there wasn’t much lighting at night for some reason. The biggest waterfall found there is not accessible to the public, but there are two other waterfalls that you can go to. One of them is located inside the Six Senses spa and you have to pay to go there while the other one located right outside the resort is free. There’s also a pool 200 meters away from the hotel but I didn’t like it much to be honest, as I would have preferred some infinity pool inside the resort with a couple of Jacuzzis to relax specially that they have a breathtaking view. </p>

<p>As far as the waterfalls are concerned, it’s quite a unique experience and it feels quite weird to be standing underneath them. They call them the “healing waterfalls” because they apparently relax the muscles and make you feel better. All in all, I highly recommend this resort if you are heading to Jordan for a week and looking for a weekend escape. You don’t need more than a couple of days at Evason Ma’In Hot Springs.</p>

<p>This pretty much covers the first part of my trip which I enjoyed quite a lot, but the best is yet to come to stay tuned for the second post where I will be talking about Petra and the desert experience mainly which were mind blowing! </p>";s:17:"post_image_height";i:576;s:16:"post_image_width";i:1024;s:11:"post_visits";i:5;s:18:"post_twitterShares";i:1;s:19:"post_facebookShares";i:1;s:16:"post_totalShares";i:2;s:16:"post_socialScore";i:7;s:13:"post_virality";i:6;s:9:"blog_name";s:11:"Blog Baladi";s:16:"blog_description";s:89:"a non-political Lebanese blog that tackles various issues related to the Lebanese society";s:8:"blog_url";s:21:"http://blogbaladi.com";s:11:"blog_author";s:11:"Najib Mitri";s:28:"blog_author_twitter_username";s:7:"LeNajib";s:13:"blog_rss_feed";s:27:"http://blogbaladi.com/feed/";s:9:"blog_tags";s:7:"society";s:2:"id";i:22;s:11:"blog_active";i:1;s:24:"blog_last_post_timestamp";i:1405709880;s:6:"col_id";N;s:8:"col_name";N;s:16:"col_media_source";N;s:13:"col_home_page";N;s:13:"col_shorthand";N;s:26:"col_media_source_shorthand";N;s:27:"col_author_twitter_username";N;s:8:"col_tags";N;s:15:"col_description";N;s:23:"col_last_post_timestamp";N;}}
