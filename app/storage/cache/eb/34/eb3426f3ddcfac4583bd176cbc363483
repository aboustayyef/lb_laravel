<p><span>Cafe Daniel (Bann Daniel) is back! First thing to notice is the logo which now contains the indication that is has been around since 1977 (but naturally it discounts the period when it was off the market). Daniel, along with Najjar and Abi Nasr were the staple ground coffee Arabica brands in Lebanon.</span></p>
<p><span>When a brand has been off the shelves for such a long time, it is a reason to change its identity and logo now that people forgot how it used to look like. But rest assured <a href="http://beirutntsc.blogspot.com/2014/05/cafe-daniel-is-back.html?m=1" target="_blank">Beirut/NTSC</a> has a picture of the old logo, which you will find was in typical 70s typo – the above logo it must be said is indeed a derivative of the old one, and has been revamped and lifted as opposed to being done from scratch.</span></p>
<p><img src="http://www.nogarlicnoonions.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Cafe-Daniel-12MB.jpg" alt="Cafe Daniel 12MB" width="600" height="800"></p>
<p><span>This naturally continues with the effort of building on a pre-existing brand and indicates the heritage that comes with it. The re-launch ad “yalli deye2… feye2″ harps on the same melody – “he who has tasted… shall remember” and obviously still sticks to people who knew Cafe Daniel as opposed to a new breed of clients from a younger generation. The TVC clearly indicates this, with very few people in the cast (perhaps just one) who are not at least sexagenarians.</span></p>

<p><strong><span>The only small annoyance is that the slogan reminds me a lot of “Iza de2et 3la2et” (if you have tasted, you are hooked) which is used massively by Zeit Boulos (Cafe Daniel with “he who has tasted… shall remember” is too close for comfort in that case). But what’s with Cafe Daniel being away for such a long time I won’t play the party spoiler for the homecoming queen!</span></strong></p>

<p><iframe src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/150268848&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_artwork=true&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false" width="100%" height="166" frameborder="no" scrolling="no"></iframe>When I heard this track by 6inho, I wanted to wear a leather jacket with a skull on my back and walk down the street slow-motion. It’s such a chill, deep and trippy track that is a pleasure to listen to while driving, working or having a get-together that’s not a rave, but people still wanna move with the beats a little.</p>
<p>The Unplugged Poets were also fans, so they took the track and added some sick lyrics to it and the flow turned out awesome. Check out this version above, and check <a href="https://soundcloud.com/6inho">6inho’s SoundCloud</a> for the one without the vocals.</p>
<h2>2- Tempus Fugit (3LIAS & Jimmy Van M Remix) – Marshall White</h2>
<p><iframe src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/151652140&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_artwork=true&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false" width="100%" height="166" frameborder="no" scrolling="no"></iframe> This rework of Marshall White’s Tempus Fugit by b018 giant 3LIAS (stamina) and the hottest addition to the b018 crew Jimmy Van M, is awesome. It’s deep and dark enough, with a glitchy melody that’ll make you move. It fits perfect with the b018 spirit, with the deep, dark sound coupled with a little something to make you look up and see the roof retract to see the city lights and starry nights above the iconic club.</p>
<h2>3- Get Togetha (Original Mix) – Jade and Diamond Setter</h2>
<p><iframe src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/20420671&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_artwork=true&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false" width="100%" height="166" frameborder="no" scrolling="no"></iframe>Jade was instrumental in my electronic music education. It’s at The Basement all those years ago where my true love for House and Tech House really solidified and where I saw dozens of amazing acts week after week, making me the self-proclaimed electronic music connoisseur I like to think of myself today. This track, along with the Jade and Diamond Setter rework of Lumi’s “Banging in the Stars” are some of the most memorable originals that take me back to those happy days. So, consider this track the blast from the past of this post.</p>
<h2>4- Never Mind – Ohm Hourani vs Ronin & Nesta</h2>

Love the dreamy, dark melody on this one. I can definitely see it do numbers in clubs around the world, and it has already made it to #45 on the Beatport top 100 Tech House chart! So, enjoy!</p>
<h2>5- 3000 Years (Dub Mix) – ESC ft. Marlene Jaber</h2>

<p>This summer is gonna be big. That’s what we keep hearing, and what we all hope for. But, all the big festivals’ acts seem mediocre compared to other years. The massive acts we’re used to seeing gracing Lebanese stages have shrunken down to more niche, less mainstream acts, which is of course great, but then again, it shows a somewhat lack of confidence in how great the summer will be.</p>
<p>From chart-toppers like Lana Del Rey and the Petshop Boyz, to acts from decades ago and more indie acts, there is much less star power this summer.</p>
<p>Ellie Goulding is arguably the biggest, with over 10 top hits to her name in the last couple of years, and a very versatile discography ranging from deep electronic dance music, to radio-invading pop, she’s never really sold out. Proof? Listen to her epic acoustic versions to know she does have quite the voice. Then, listen to her chart-topping collabs with folks like Tinie Tempah. And then, watch her pull off covers of indie acts every hipster in Beirut adores (I’ll admit I love them too) Alt-J and The Weeknd.</p>
<p>So, if you’re looking for the summer’s biggest concert, with an artist that’s in now, whose songs most of you can sing along to, and in a large venue like BIEL, y’all know where to be on July 23rd (and tickets are already running out). <a href="https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=626662494085948">RSVP Here</a></p>

<blockquote><p>Samir Kassir was assassinated on June 2, 2005, in Beirut, when a bomb placed under his car was detonated. The tragic death of this journalist and writer was one of many attempts to silence Lebanese free thinkers, put an end to the Independence Intifada, and prevent Beirut’s winds of liberty from spreading across the region. Samir Kassir, who wrote Beirut’s history, has therefore become a part of this history.</p>
<p>The model of intellectual renaissance embodied by Samir Kassir during his life and at the moment of his death, through his articles and academic research, has placed him at the avant-garde of Lebanese and Arab opinion leaders who have paid their life to fight tyranny and lead their country to freedom and independence.

<p>Today we remember Samir Kassir.</p>
<p>Nine years ago to this day, a car bomb exploded in Beirut. The usual confusion that followed was soon replaced with a nation-wide shock. The victim this time was none another than Samir Kassir.</p>
<p>Kassir cannot be described in a few words, so I won’t try and do so. The son of a Palestinian father and a Syrian mother, Kassir was one of the most well known intellectuals of the Arab left. He was a strong supporter of the Palestinian cause, and of Secular Democracy throughout the Middle East. His attempt to defend universal principles of equality and justice and adopt them to a Pan-Arab context made him deeply unpopular with some, leading to his death – it is usually believed that it was his opposition to the Syrian government’s presence in Lebanon and his criticism of the Baath party that killed him.</p>
<p>The following is an extract from the book “<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Being-Arab-Samir-Kassir/dp/1844672808/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1401695501&sr=8-1&keywords=being+arab" target="_blank">Being Arab</a>” in which he popularized the concept of the “Arab Malaise”:</p>
<hr><p>
</p><p>
</p><p align="left"><strong>The worst aspect of the Arabs’ malaise is their refusal to emerge from it, but, if happiness is not in sight, some form of equilibrium at least is possible</strong><strong> </strong>[Extract as it appears in <em>Making the World Legible</em>]</p>
<p align="left">Some people are driven to despair by the Arab malaise. They believe that the Arabs are so profoundly trapped that they will never be able to break free and, in so believing, they only make the deadlock worse. This is the extreme variant of modernism, propounded by liberals, disappointed nationalists and former activists of the left alike. Decline, according to this way of thinking, is so widespread that it damns the very notion of a renaissance: the nahda† did not just end in failure, but it was also by its very nature a historical anomaly, an impossibility right from the outset. Worse still, all attempts to free the Arabs from their predicament, particularly nationalism, are considered to have only made the problem worse. Some of these disappointed souls go so far as to internalize the culturalist distinctions that legitimize imperial domination. Their most affirmative thesis, echoing the American neoconservatives, is that change and democracy can only come from such domination, not realizing that all this will achieve is to aggravate frustrations, exacerbate victimhood and the culture of death, and thereby perpetuate the Arab malaise. For, if they are to overcome their malaise, the Arabs have no choice but to do it themselves.</p>
<p align="left">
Then there are those people for whom things are never better than when everything’s wrong. Obviously these are the Islamist jihadists who, as good messianists, see the Arab malaise just as a bad moment to be got through – well, not as bad as all that actually, since it can be a way to gain paradise and the forty houris while waiting for that strange revolution which, unlike its Marxist original, is not seen as a leap into the future, but as a return to an original purity lost in the mists of time.</p>
<p align="left">
As a system of thought, jihadist Islamism is far from being the dominant ideology it is often portrayed as in the Western media. Yet it is powerful, no doubt because it is the only ideology that seems to offer relief from the victim status the Arabs delight in claiming (a status that in fact Islamism, jihadist or otherwise, is only too happy to confirm). Arab victimhood goes beyond the ‘Why do they hate us?’ question, which Arabs would be as entitled to ask as the Americans were on the morning of September 11. Inflamed by the West’s attitude to the Palestinian question, it has incorporated other elements, notably the feeling of powerlessness and also a certain crime-novel vision of history.</p>
<p align="left">
The cult of the victim claims that Arabs are the West’s primary target, totally disregarding the other peoples of the world, and world history in general. No mention is made of Africa and its systematic pillaging; of the Americas and the genocide of the pre-Columbian populations, perpetuated in the continued marginalization of their cultures, of Indochina and its decimated generations.</p>
<p align="left">
Of course I am not denying what we have presupposed, that the Arabs have nothing that might compensate them for their misfortune, and that the Arab world is the only region on earth where the West has continually acted as if it were the master – and still does today, either directly or through Israel. But this doesn’t change the fact that recognizing the threat to the Arab world is not the same as condoning Arab victimhood. None of the major figures of the renaissance showed any signs of indulging such a cult, nor the ideologues or practitioners of nationalism. Victims par excellence, the Palestinians avoided it in the past, and continue in a very large degree to do so, even if their situation fosters a propensity among those who helplessly look on to claim such a status.</p>
<p align="left">
Victimhood is the price of the defeat of the universal, rather than a product of the status quo, and its cult, served by the Arab media, in particular the much-lionized Al-Jazeera, has only been able to grow because the ideology of the moment preaches a refusal of the universal. Ideology is in fact a very grand word for the current amalgam of the fossilized remains of Arab nationalism, which, because of their age, have cut themselves off from their original, universalist sources of inspiration, and an ‘Islamic nationalism’ that explicitly sets out to differentiate itself from the universal, if not supplant it. Such a nationalist mishmash is not new. It was around at the end of the nineteenth century, propounded notably by Afghani. The only difference is that Afghani was a reformer of Islam, with a perfect knowledge of, and uninhibited dealings with, Western thought. The same cannot be said of his present-day successors, who abhor nothing so much as talk of religious reform.</p>
<p align="left">
Islamic nationalism isn’t just a synonym for jihadism. It is defensive in essence, whereas jihadism can in certain lights see itself as a new conquest of the world. But the distinction between the two is nonetheless a tenuous one, and there can be no doubt that Islamic nationalism prepares the ground for jihadism. For while it may not deny the Arab malaise, as jihadism does, it nonetheless predisposes those who complain of the malaise to wallow in it, so much so that they will only replace it with something similar: the culture of death which the union of fossilized Arab nationalism and political Islam calls resistance.</p>
<p align="left">
There is undoubtedly an inherent explanation of the culture of death – not that it is an invariant of Islam or an essence of Arabness, but rather that, as a spectacle of endless bloodshed, it instils a self-perpetuating logic of blood for blood. If there can be no victory, then at least there can be the consolation of bloodletting – others’ blood, obviously, but ours as well.</p>
<p align="left">
This logic may not be an invariant of Islam, but the fact remains that a religious vision of the world is at work here, even a religious vision in the sense of a system of cruelty, as Nietzsche put it. It goes without saying that this has nothing to do with the idea of sacrifice. Sacrifice has been at the root of all human conflict since the dawn of history, for the Arabs as much as anyone else, and this is the real meaning of jihad in the martial sense (there are also peaceful forms of jihad). In the twentieth century, the Palestinian fighters called themselves fedayeen, those ready to sacrifice their lives, like the Egyptian nationalists before them who fought the British at Suez. But in the new jihadism, death has ceased to be a potential, or even probable, price to be paid. Death has become the indispensable means to a desired end, if not an actual end in itself.</p>
<p align="left">
This vision of martial jihad incarnated in the figure of the istishhadi, the one who seeks martyrdom (the kamikaze, in other words), has no real antecedent in Arab-Muslim culture apart from the – non-Arab – sect of the Assassins. In the modern era, one has to wait until the Iranian revolution for its return. Shia at first, it emerged on the frontline of the Iraq-Iran war, where unbroken waves of volunteers checked the advance of the Iraqi armoured divisions before launching themselves against the Iraqi lines at the start of 1982. It appeared next in Lebanon in the form of individual suicide attacks against Western interests and the Israeli occupying forces. It should be noted that this extreme method may have been effective against the Americans, but traditional guerrilla tactics – ambushes, explosions and so on – were more decisive against the Israelis. Nonetheless other groups, some of them secular, adopted it as a model. Hezbollah gave it up when it became the only method of resistance, but kept the symbolism of blood and the totem of the istishhadi – a symbolism that it reinforces through the observance of Ashura. Originating in Iranian Shiism before passing to Lebanon and now Iraq, the rituals of this festival of redemptive suffering resemble certain bloody celebrations of Good Friday, in Spain for instance or the Philippines.</p>
<p align="left">
In principle, an insurmountable obstacle divides the Shia and the Sunni jihadists. Radical Sunni Islamism, as the doctrinal statements that have been coming out of Iraq show, holds Shia to be heretics and rafida, people who reject the true faith. Sunni Qur’anic literalism clearly also has its intellectual origins in South Asian Islam, notably the thought of Mawdudi, which, through the conduit of the Egyptian Sayyid Qutb, has permeated its takfiri, or apostatizing, strain. None of this matters, however. The martyrdom seekers first appeared in Shia circles, with the shahids recording their last testaments on video (the price of modernity). Furthermore, of the two Palestinian groups that have practised suicide bombing, one, Islamic Jihad, is reputed to be close to Iran, while the other, Hamas, although an offshoot of the Muslim Brotherhood, is on very good terms with Lebanese Hezbollah.</p>
<p align="left">   The proliferation of the culture of death and the evening-out of differences between Shias and Sunnis cannot be explained solely by the Islamization of the fight against Israel. Over and above actual events,<br>
the media, especially Al-Jazeera, have played a key role in this process, peddling a lowest-common-denominator mix of Arab nationalism and Islamic nationalism. It was doing this before September 11, defending means, justifying ends, claiming Arab victimhood. The Arab public has been systematically primed to accept the thesis of a ‘clash of civilizations’.</p>
<p align="left">
Nonetheless, we must be able to continue rebutting Huntingdon and remembering Lévi-Strauss. If we could address the protagonists of the ‘war against terror’ or the ‘jihad against the crusaders’ in academic terms, that ought surely to be the watchword of a new universalism.</p>
<p align="left">
Nothing is harder than rebutting Huntingdon at a time when people are doing their utmost to cultivate difference. On the one hand, politicians and commentators constantly invoke an Eastern essentialism, even if, after long tirades opposing ‘us’ and ‘them’, they see fit to stress that Arabs and Muslims should not all be lumped in with the terrorists. On the other, there is a tendency to qualify, or even justify, the horrors of New York in terms of the evils of American politics, even if people are careful to preface their remarks with the disclaimer that the murder of innocent people goes against every precept of Islam.</p>
<p align="left">
We must not forget Lévi-Strauss: ‘civilization’, as he says, is not a category and hence cannot contain ‘natural’ hierarchies; and humanity is one, since it rests on a common anthropological foundation. In other words, it is as meaningless to talk of an ‘attack on civilization’ as it is to classify people according to their adherence to a faith, Muslim or otherwise. I should perhaps point out that supremacy isn’t exclusively white. Some people in Muslim societies may be drawn to radical Islam for defensive reasons, because they feel under threat, but the rhetoric used by the warlords of radical Islamism is intentionally offensive. They justify their triumphalist proselytizing by defining the ‘decadent’ civilization of the Other as inferior.</p>
<p align="left">
So it is not just the West that needs to re-examine its stance. The Arab world in particular needs to make a profound effort to eradicate the ambiguities that encourage a logic of cultural confrontation. This means first putting victimhood into perspective. We must replace Arabs’ customary assumption of victim status not by cultivating a logic of power or a spirit of revenge, but by recognizing the fact that, despite bringing defeats, the twentieth century has also brought benefits that can enable Arabs to participate in progress. Equally, we must reject the moral pragmatism lurking in the cult of the victim. If we cannot accept the powerful saying that the ends justify the means, then we can’t let the victims do so either. We must not confuse terrorism with resistance, as the West confuses resistance with terrorism.</p>
<p align="left">
But, apart from the effects and means of confrontation, if the Arab world is to reject a clash of civilizations, then we must also give up a negative Arabocentrism (or Islamocentrism) which sees world history purely as a threat to us, and as a ‘cultural’, rather than political or military, threat. By the same token, we must renounce essentialist justifications of the sort that explain the silence surrounding the long affair of the Western hostages in Lebanon in the 1980s, or the indulgent attitudes towards the fatwa against Salman Rushdie. We must accept that democratic values are now part of humanity’s shared heritage.</p>
<p align="left">
Such a re-examination could take place. The problem is that the elites that might push for it are caught between non-democratic regimes (frequently supported by the West, despite the ‘democratic crusade’ in<br>

<p>When I first set out to build <em>Lebanese Blogs</em>, my idea was to create a new space to read blogs without the stress of another inbox in our lives (all those unread items in google reader drove me nuts). <em>Lebanese Blogs</em>, in my mind, is much more than an RSS reader. It is a space for discovering, organizing and learning about our community.</p>
<p>That said however, I realize that some habits die hard and that not everybody has the same needs. Some people really do enjoy plowing through their feed reader every evening (heck I still do that myself for international tech and media blogs). Moreover, my ultimate objective is for our bloggers to have the widest readership possible. This is why I decided to publish RSS feeds, and make them awesome at that.</p>
<h3>The best RSS feeds on Lebanon’s internet</h3>
<p><em>Lebanese Blogs</em> now publishes a <a href="http://lebaneseblogs.com/feed">general RSS feed</a> which includes all the blog posts. But that is overkill for most of you (people who like fashion often don’t want to read about politics and vice versa), so I also published category feeds (<a href="http://lebaneseblogs.com/feed/food">food</a>, <a href="http://lebaneseblogs.com/feed/fashion">fashion</a>, <a href="http://lebaneseblogs.com/feed/politics">politics</a>, <a href="http://lebaneseblogs.com/feed/design">design</a>, <a href="http://lebaneseblogs.com/feed/columnists">columnists</a>, <a href="http://lebaneseblogs.com/feed/tech">tech</a>, <a href="http://lebaneseblogs.com/feed/society">society</a>, <a href="http://lebaneseblogs.com/feed/media">media</a>) which allow you to cherry pick what you’re interested in (be mindful though that some bloggers exist in several categories, so you might experience some duplicate items if you’re subscribed to more than one category feed).</p>
<p>Also, unlike other aggregation feeds, ours offer blogger-specific details. For example, each post suggests that you follow its author on Twitter and tries to encourage you to read the post on the blog itself.</p>
<h3>A note to bloggers and authors</h3>
<p>The articles on the feed only include your post’s image and a tiny excerpt. If readers are interested in the post, they’ll have to read it on your own site. I don’t want this feed to be an alternative to your blog.</p>
<p>I hope you really enjoy this feature and, as always, if you have further questions don’t hesitate to <a href="http://twitter.com/beirutspring">drop me a tweet</a>..<br>

<p>The floral prints continues for the summer. Be prepared to embrace your inner lady with floral print dresses, swimsuits, shoes, and even sunglasses. Like u already saw through our blog, we adore this iconic pattern !!!The next floral trend we decided to cover was the mood for something a little more feminine, like floral cocktail dresses. The light blue and white patterned dress suits very well the atmosphere of the beach season. For more elegancy, pair it with white heeled sandals and a very funky reflective sunglasses. So come on ladies, give floral prints a try this summer too  if you want a touch of beauty and romance in your wardrobe.</p>

Last week we took a closer look at <strong><a href="http://ivysays.com/2014/05/22/profiling-lebanons-next-first-lady-sethrida-geagea/">Sethrida Geagea,</a></strong> wife of presidential candidate Samir Geagea. This week, Rima Karkafi Frangieh is on our fashion radar, wife of presidential hopeful and Marada party leader Sleiman Frangieh.</p>
<p>Rima is Sleiman’s second wife and mother of his youngest child Vera. Before wedding Frangieh in 2003, Rima worked as a TV presenter at the Lebanese Broadcasting Corporation (LBC) for seven years. Prior to that Rima who hails from an Iraqi mother and Lebanese father lived and attended university in Sydney after fleeing the war in Lebanon. Rima is most known for her social activism most notably in the North where she resides and volunteers her time to various charity causes and is the President of Ehdeniyat International Festival as well as the North Autism center.</p>
<p>In spite of her husband’s somewhat bleak chances of becoming president, there’s no denying Rima’s first lady material. With her feminine style and signature hair Rima will add a dainty allure to the presidential palace.

<p>The studies <a href="http://greenresistance.wordpress.com/2014/05/30/lebanons-polluted-rivers/">conducted</a> by the Beirut Arab University and the Lebanese University researchers have shown high concentration of heavy metals, residue from olive oil production, dangerous bacteria and other toxins being illegally dumped in the Hasbani River in South Lebanon and the Lower Litani River Basin.</p>
<p>Our sea is polluted, our rivers are polluted, our crops are <a href="http://blogbaladi.com/is-this-true/">watered</a> with sewers, our cities are polluted and we’re setting forests on fire to replace them with polluting buildings and industries. It’s looking bad but it’s never too late to do something about it. Environment Minister Mohammad Machnouk said he will develop a plan of action to prevent pollution in Qaraoun Lake and the Litani River Basin so let’s hope he does it ASAP.</p>
<blockquote><p>Lebanon’s rivers are alarmingly polluted with untreated sewage and waste, posing health risks for consumers who use the water at home and for farmers who irrigate their crops with it, local scientists warned.</p>
<p>The latest findings, which confirm the results of a slew of research on river pollution over the past decade, come ahead of the government’s unveiling of a road map next week to fight the contamination of the Litani River Basin and Qaraoun Lake.</p>
<p>Two new studies by Beirut Arab University and Lebanese University researchers show high concentrations of heavy metals, residue from olive oil production, dangerous bacteria and other toxins – evidence of untreated waste and illegal dumping in the Hasbani River in South Lebanon and the Lower Litani River Basin.

<p>Stereokitchen is a new 500 sq.m restaurant/ bar that opened in building in Pasteur st., Beirut, Lebanon. Designed by architect <strong>Paul Kaloustian</strong>, the main theme while designing was basing the layout around a perfect circle, this way the restaurant will make most of the breathtaking views surrounding the buildin, spacially that it is glass all around.</p>
<p>Materials used give a very neutral appearance, focusing on exposed concrete, wood, and light colored furniture, no drama was intended with this concept. Ceiling & lighting was designed by the famous Beirut based lighting company .<a href="http://saharghazale.com//?s=PSLAB&x=0&y=0#utm_source=feed&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=feed">PSLAB</a>.</p>

<p>Here’s the thing, there are more misconceptions about being a feminist than there are about Lebanese politics. That being said, I am still a furious feminist.<br>
I don’t say it to bug people. It’s who I am and I am proud of it, despite the hatred I get for it.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span></span></p>
<p>When someone says the word “feminism,” the first thoughts that cross my mind are of the astounding forthright women who were involved in the Women’s Liberation Movement in the late 60s and 70s. It is surprising and sad, however, that this is not the picture most people envision when I say the word ‘feminist.’</p>
<p>As an activist for gender equality, I often ask myself; how has such an inspirational term transformed into a pejorative offense? The answer is in the socially constructed connotation of the word, and in what it means to be a feminist in this part of the world.</p>
<p>Last week, I was with some friends walking around Hamra when this adorable baby girl passed by; I couldn’t help but notice how cute she was. The words I heard next were wounding and uncalled for; “but you’re a feminist, how can you have that motherly feeling?” someone said. The level of disregard and impertinence that people have towards women who are outspoken and demand equality is beyond my understanding. Am I not allowed to love children because I want to be treated equally? Am I not permitted to act like the woman I am and long to be a mother because I want to abolish the pay gap? Am I not to be respected as a human being because I am opinionated and frank? There are major myths about feminism that need to debunked, now.</p>
<p>As usual with these much-contested topics, the term has a range of explanations; some virtuous, some more offensive and false. To many, it means that women and men should be considered equals in all aspects, as [not-so-simple] as it may sound. To others, it is a liberating term that allows for women to choose whatever lifestyle they please without being judged or labeled.</p>
<p>What many people do not understand is that it shouldn’t and doesn’t blindly signify a Marxist, anti-capitalist, anti-family, political movement that encourages women to leave their husbands, become lesbians, or even practice sorcery. There is nothing wrong with being all those things if you wish to be, but you don’t have to be in order to identify yourself as a feminist.</p>
<p>When I read news about young girls getting kidnapped, brutally assaulted and forced into marriage, about women getting fired for ‘asking too much,’ about females worldwide being sidelined, frequently sexualized and regularly stereotyped, I cannot help but identify as a feminist.</p>
<p>I feel that if you’re a person who can confidently say ‘I recognize injustice in the world,’ people are going to attack and depreciate you. I’ve noticed that most people find it a hell of a lot easier to say ‘you’re a feminazi’ rather than having to deal with the mere fact that perhaps our institutions are fabricated in a way that values some and oppresses others. It’s easier to dismiss a woman as a freak than to listen to her critique of society.</p>
<p>So just as a reminder, I am not a bra-burning man-hater who encourages all women to perform abortions and murder their partners. Feminism is not about combating men or femininity, but fundamentally about fighting inequality and oppression. And yes, you can possess a Y chromosome and be a feminist. If you believe women should be politically, socially, and economically equal to men, then guess what? You already are one.<br>
It really is that simple.</p><br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/whatrhymeswithellen.wordpress.com/1127/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/whatrhymeswithellen.wordpress.com/1127/"></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=whatrhymeswithellen.com&blog=64610512&post=1127&subd=whatrhymeswithellen&ref=&feed=1" width="1" height="1">";s:17:"post_image_height";i:720;s:16:"post_image_width";i:960;s:11:"post_visits";i:5;s:18:"post_twitterShares";i:4;s:19:"post_facebookShares";i:51;s:16:"post_totalShares";i:55;s:16:"post_socialScore";i:21;s:13:"post_virality";i:32;s:9:"blog_name";s:22:"What Rhymes With Ellen";s:16:"blog_description";s:144:"This is a blog for the Lebanon we tell foreigners about, the Lebanon of books, and music, and theatre instead of bombs and botox and barbarians.";s:8:"blog_url";s:31:"http://whatrhymeswithellen.com/";s:11:"blog_author";s:13:"Ellen Francis";s:28:"blog_author_twitter_username";s:15:"rhymeswithellen";s:13:"blog_rss_feed";s:36:"http://whatrhymeswithellen.com/feed/";s:9:"blog_tags";s:7:"society";s:2:"id";i:292;s:11:"blog_active";i:1;s:24:"blog_last_post_timestamp";i:1401678960;}}
