<p><span><strong>This summer has been a mixed bag when it comes to R-rated comedies. While flicks like <em>22 Jump Street </em>and <em>Neighbors </em>have been embraced by the general public, others like <em>Tammy </em>and <em>A Million Ways to Die in the West </em>have been less reliable. <em>Sex Tape</em>, I’m sad to say, is largely devoid of any laughs, and wastes a mostly talented cast (I say mostly because I quite dislike Cameron Diaz) and a clever premise on lazy, unfunny, and obnoxious jokes.</strong></span></p>
<p><span>Annie (Cameron Diaz) and Jay (Jason Segel) have been married for a while, and their sex life isn’t what it used to be. In an attempt to spice things up, the two make a sex tape that accidentally ends up getting uploaded to the cloud, which means all their friends and family now have access to it. It’s now up to them to make sure no one watches that tape, no matter what it takes.</span></p>
<p><span><a href="https://ageeksblogdotcom1.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/sex-tape-movie__iphone_640.jpg"><span><img src="http://ageeksblogdotcom1.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/sex-tape-movie__iphone_640.jpg?w=650&h=389" alt="sex-tape-movie__iphone_640"></span></a></span></p>
<p><span>I’m going to be completely blunt; I’m not a fan of Cameron Diaz. Call me biased, I don’t care, but she has no acting chops. Not that she’s the only issue with <em>Sex Tape</em>, but she’s certainly a big part of the problem. I was cringing every time she opened her mouth, and her chemistry with Jason Segel was non-existant. Speaking of Segel, he was quite off as well, which is weird and disappointing considering he’s one of my favorite comedic actors. This is totally unrelated, but I was also really distracted by how skinny he now looks; it took me around half the movie’s running time to get used to it.</span></p>
<p><span>The screenplay, which was co-written by Segel and comedy veteran Nicholas Stoller (among others), is terrible. Jokes fall flat left and right, and everyone is simply trying too hard to be raunchy that it comes off as desperate. The bland and uninspired direction by Jake Kasdan also adds nothing to the yawn-inducing dialogue. The only positives about the flick are Rob Lowe, who plays Annie’s soon to be boss, and the ever-reliable Rob Corddry as Annie and Jay’s longtime friend. Everything and everyone else is just a waste of air.</span></p>

<p><span><strong>The Verdict:</strong></span></p>
<p><span><em>Sex Tape</em> really could have been something special. Instead, it’s a boring and obnoxious mess with only a handful of laughs. As a massive Jason Segel fan, I was extremely disappointed. You’re better off staying home and making your own sex tape.</span></p>

I thought you should know this fact because it’s the only damn thing left for Hollywood to exploit in a franchise. This ridiculous sequel is more of the same, only less likable; Once a year, for 12 hours, the government condones robbery, rape and murder. That’s cue for five good people to wind up running for their lives on the nasty streets of Los Angeles during this night of terror. Considering the number of horror disappointments with a “2″ after the title, I did not approach this movie with much optimism, even though director James DeMonaco shows a sure hand at building tension. Sadly, my fear was justified 10 minutes later. The idea of a Purge isn’t merely a bad concept, but a dumb and irrelevant one. And even that could have been forgiven had the movie actually tried to have fun with the idea in the first place, but it does not. The movie plods along between plot points without any direction and you can see every turn in the plot coming for miles. As far as sequels go, “The Purge: Anarchy” is silly, repetitive, and far from interesting. I say skip it.</p>

Do you hear me Jack?"</span></i><br><br>After a highly generic season, I didn't expect this finale to be such a monumental gut-punch. But it was <b>glorious</b>. <br><br>Let me be this clear, this wasn't a <u>bad</u> season of <i>24</i>. It was well-executed, and it felt like classic Jack Bauer with the requisite double crosses, big bads, and shootouts. But it also didn't offer anything new (and maybe a large part of the audience wasn't craving that). But the television landscape has changed immensely since <i>24</i> left the airwaves in 2010. Bombshell twists have become a weekly occurrence, and shows today rarely shy away from killing off central characters (a feat that was <i>24</i>'s bread and butter back when it first stormed onto the scene). And aside from the show's unique format, this season felt largely derivative and by-the-numbers; nothing ever really surprised me throughout the course of these 12 episodes. I never felt like I was dying to watch the next episode. Instead, I kept watching out of habit and sheer loyalty to Jack Bauer (one of my most favorite characters of all time). <br><br>And that's why this finale was so good. It shocked me. In fact, it blew my brains out, particularly with the gruesome murder of Jack's one true love, Audrey. I honestly never expected the writing staff to kill her off after everything she'd been through, but ultimately, this act further reiterated something we've known all along: <i>24</i> is a tragic story, and Jack will never <i>really</i> get his happy ending. On the bright side, Audrey's death gave Jack a magnificent final rampage which Keifer Sutherland sold perfectly. The utter desolation on Jack's face after Kate's call, the hopelessness as he takes out his gun (undoubtedly read to off himself), and finally his renewed determination as he shoots, smashes and slices everyone in his path. It's a marvelous crescendo of violence that culminates with Jack brutally decapitating Cheng. And as horrifying as his act is, it's also strangely cheery-worthy and satisfying. <u><b>Wow. </b></u><br><br>Surprisingly, President Heller stood out as the show's MVP this year. William Devane delivered consistently solid work across the season, and he was downright transcendent in the finale. I found myself teary-eyed as the President heard the news of his daughter's passing and crashed to the ground. But I was astounded by his beautiful acceptance of his Alzheimer's during Audrey's burial, and his gratitude in the fact that he would eventually forget the traumas he endured. If I had doubts that the disease would serve any significant purpose in the beginning of the season, they were suitably put to rest by the time this grim and enormously haunting sequence came to light. <br><br>I know many people hated <i>24</i>'s series finale back in 2010 (with Jack ending his journey on the run), but I found it to be a pretty much perfect ending to the saga. So imagine my surprise when I loved this finale's ending as well. Jack gladly sacrificed his freedom in exchange for his "best friend" Chloe. It's a surprisingly uplifting sort of ending with Jack also finding penance for Audrey's death (the guilt would have eaten him alive). And naturally, Jack surviving the season means FOX will be investing in the show's return if the ratings are good enough. I just wonder if that's even necessary; can <i>24</i> ever really be groundbreaking again? I think I'd love to find out. <br><br><span><b>Ticking Bits</b></span><br><br>- Mark telling Jack that Audrey loves him made me smile. <br><br>- Again, I must stress how heartbreaking Audrey's death was. The fact that a tear streamed down her cheek before she accepted her death and peacefully closed her eyes was just harrowing. <br><br>- Time jump! First time ever on the show; didn't really feel all that special honestly. <br><br>- I don't know how I feel about Kate's character arc this year. Her quitting at the end made me feel like I invested in her plight for nothing. Still, it was great to see Jack trust her in saving Audrey (haha). <br><br>- I can't remember if I ever like Chloe during the show's original run (I binge-watched it all within the span of a month), but she did absolutely nothing for me this year. Still, I appreciate what she means to Jack and how pivotal she is to his journey.<br><br>- Seriously, that final helicopter sequence was beautiful. <br><br><span><b>Conclusion</b></span><br>An incredibly exciting and powerful closer to a somewhat disappointing season. If this is indeed the end, at least Jack Bauer's legacy was left intact. Superb. <br><br><span><b>Nad Rating</b></span><br><span><span><b>A</b></span></span></div></div>";s:17:"post_image_height";i:1026;s:16:"post_image_width";i:1600;s:11:"post_visits";i:4;s:18:"post_twitterShares";i:2;s:19:"post_facebookShares";i:6;s:16:"post_totalShares";i:8;s:16:"post_socialScore";i:13;s:13:"post_virality";i:17;s:9:"blog_name";s:13:"Nad's Reviews";s:16:"blog_description";s:72:"Nad's Reviews specializes in TV reviews as well as films and restaurants";s:8:"blog_url";s:27:"http://www.nadsreviews.com/";s:11:"blog_author";s:3:"Nad";s:28:"blog_author_twitter_username";s:11:"NadsReviews";s:13:"blog_rss_feed";s:54:"http://www.nadsreviews.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss";s:9:"blog_tags";s:18:"tv, culture, media";s:2:"id";i:162;s:11:"blog_active";i:1;s:24:"blog_last_post_timestamp";i:1405593540;s:6:"col_id";N;s:8:"col_name";N;s:16:"col_media_source";N;s:13:"col_home_page";N;s:13:"col_shorthand";N;s:26:"col_media_source_shorthand";N;s:27:"col_author_twitter_username";N;s:8:"col_tags";N;s:15:"col_description";N;s:23:"col_last_post_timestamp";N;}i:4;O:8:"stdClass":36:{s:7:"post_id";i:32919;s:8:"post_url";s:59:"http://ageeksblog.com/2014/07/18/movie-review-boyhood-2014/";s:10:"post_title";s:28:"Movie Review: Boyhood (2014)";s:10:"post_image";s:68:"http://ageeksblogdotcom1.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/boyhood0612.jpg";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:123:"It’s simple: you have never seen a movie like Boyhood before, and you likely never will again.

<p><span><strong>It’s simple: you have never seen a movie like <em>Boyhood </em>before, and you likely never will again. Shot over a 12-year period with the same cast, Richard Linklater’s latest is the definition of a masterpiece, and it’s hands down the best movie of the year, and one of the most memorable cinematic experiences you will ever have. </strong></span></p>
<p><span>I’m honestly not even sure how I’m supposed to describe the plot, because it genuinely feels like you’re watching real life unfold before your very eyes. The film’s protagonist, Mason (Ellar Coltane) literally grows up on screen, and we watch him deal with life, one moment at a time. It’s mind-blowingly impressive from a technical perspective, but it’s also extremely real and deceptively simple. Again, it’s like watching real life. I’m just going to leave it at that.</span></p>

<p><span>For one, director Richard Linklater deserves heaps of praise for this meticulously crafted piece of art. Never in my life have I experienced something like this, and it truly is an <em>experience. </em>The performances he manages to get out of these actors, particularly Ellar Coltrane and Lorelei Linklater (who plays Mason’s sister, Samantha) are incredible. They’ve really matured into solid actors.</span></p>
<p><span>I fell in love with how time progresses in <em>Boyhood. </em>Whether it’s a perfectly timed musical cue, pop culture reference, or a shot of one of the young actors now looking a bit older, it just works. The soundtrack is also brilliant and consists of some of my favorite bands, so that’s also a huge plus.</span></p>

<p><span>Patricia Arquette and Ethan Hawke are perfect as Mason and Samantha’s parents, and their relationship with their kids is a big part of why this film succeeds. You forget that you’re watching a movie and start believing that they’re their actual parents, which comes as a result of Linklater’s amazing 12-year effort to bring this story to life. </span></p>
<p><span>But the movie is so much more than just a sprawling epic that spans half a decade; it’s an extremely personal tale of a young boy finding himself and learning about life. Mason goes from a wide-eyed five-year-old kid to this pensive, often gloomy teenager, and I for one couldn’t help but relate to him and his struggles. In fact, everyone can relate to some part of his life, which makes this movie so damn resonant.</span></p>

<p><span><em>Boyhood</em> is also extremely funny, and it feels so effortless thanks to the incredible writing and flawless performances. There’s also some great tension, and whenever you think you know where the story is going, it goes in a completely different direction. The film is almost three hours long, yet not one single scene felt unnecessary or indulgent. In fact, I could have easily sat there for another five hours.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>The Verdict:</strong></span></p>
<p><span><em>Boyhood</em> is one of the greatest cinematic achievements of our generation, but don’t take my word for it, experience it for yourself. You’ll be happy you did. It’s a masterpiece in every sense of the word.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Numerical Score: 10/10</strong></span></p>
