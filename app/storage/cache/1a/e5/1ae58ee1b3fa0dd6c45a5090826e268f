A group of internationally renown singers are not only officially planning a big concert in Lebanon but they will also be <strong>singing in Lebanese</strong>!</p>
<p>In fact, big performers such as <strong>Madonna, Rihanna, Eminem, Justin Bieber</strong> and others are already packing their bags for the long awaited trip.</p>
<p>Blog of the Boss learned that the decision came after their respective agents informed them of the now famous decline of artistic greatness that our country once enjoyed.</p>
<p>Below is a list of the songs which will be performed in Lebanese mother tongue by the <strong>ALL STAR artists group</strong>:</p>

<p>Here is a glimpse of some of the local reactions which surfaced as the details of this huge announcement started spreading:</p>
<p>- Lebanese singers announced that they are not threatened by the new comers since “<strong>el se7a el fanniyye betse3 el kell</strong>”<br>
- A big comity of poets was formed to create weird combination of titles for the visiting singers such as “Amirat Kawakib El Ghina2″ or “Sa7ib al 7Ounjoura al Zahabiyya”<br>
- Lebanese security apparatus kicked off an intense research on the background of each performer to <strong>BAN any of them</strong> that ever sang anything that contains the word Jews or that rhymes with it like Juice or other…<br>
- Local producers started preparing the recording kit to make sure all songs are available to the public on CD and <strong>most importantly on Cassette</strong> (also written K7)<br>
- Voice Over professionals started rehearsing the line “You7yi al sahra da7ik el layl Elie Ayoub”<br>
- The Miss Lebanon comity offered the visiting singers <strong>a chance to be on the judging panel of the beauty pageant</strong> despite the fact that singing has nothing to do with beauty<br>
- Lebanese Script writers completed the work on all the lines that the International Singers should make sure to state loudly on stage such as repeatedly mispronouncing “marhaba” and making sure to thank Simon Asmar or Prince Walid Ben Talal<br>
- Arab patriots started lobbying to get the multinational stars aboard their new project: “The return of : Al 7elm Al 3Arabi”<br>
- Lebanese Embassies were instructed to include extremely tough VISA conditions which would guarantee none of the stars <strong>would stay in Lebanon illegally or marry one of the locals just to obtain citizenship</strong> (especially after the <a href="http://blogoftheboss.com/a-lebanese-american-wedding-sneak-previews-from-the-george-clooney-amal-alamuddin-nuptials/" title="George Clooney – Amal Alamuddin: My Big Fat Lebanese-American Wedding?" target="_blank">Clooney-Alameddin</a> so called love story)</p>";s:17:"post_image_height";i:500;s:16:"post_image_width";i:500;s:11:"post_visits";i:19;s:18:"post_twitterShares";i:52;s:19:"post_facebookShares";i:298;s:16:"post_totalShares";i:350;s:16:"post_socialScore";i:43;s:13:"post_virality";i:47;s:9:"blog_name";s:16:"Blog of the Boss";s:16:"blog_description";s:68:"Strong believer in social change and in the healing power of comedy.";s:8:"blog_url";s:25:"http://blogoftheboss.com/";s:11:"blog_author";s:10:"Ralph Aoun";s:28:"blog_author_twitter_username";s:9:"ralphaoun";s:13:"blog_rss_feed";s:30:"http://blogoftheboss.com/feed/";s:9:"blog_tags";s:17:"politics, society";s:2:"id";i:287;s:11:"blog_active";i:1;s:24:"blog_last_post_timestamp";i:1401669000;}i:1;O:8:"stdClass":26:{s:7:"post_id";i:30559;s:8:"post_url";s:38:"http://www.larmoiredelana.com/?p=14699";s:10:"post_title";s:37:"Tricks and Trends: I’m Blue Dabadee";s:10:"post_image";s:79:"http://www.larmoiredelana.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/1A0A6266-700px-web.jpg";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:123:"The color blue was thankfully voted the Pantone 2014 color.

I know I’ve mentioned it several times already but it’s my favorite color e-v-e-r. I believe that throughout our existences, we are always looking to achieve serenity, throughout our daily actions and the goals that we set to complete. For me, blue fully represents serenity and everything that’s soothing. It’s not a wonder that it was proven to be the best color for a bedroom in many statistics. Yes, if your room is blue, you have more chances of sleeping more! Today’s post is a tribute to this color in a hue that suits most skin, hair and eye colors. It just gives a beautiful glow to your face that will not let your outfit be unnoticed. For this summer, make sure to mix it with neutrals like white and nude or clear colors like any pastel shades. Adding a hint of exotic skin to your outfits also never hurts!</span></p>

<p>I read that the app <a href="http://www.lorientlejour.com/article/869560/un-jeune-libanais-lance-une-application-iphone-a-succes.html">reached</a> the top of the productivity apps list on the App Store but that’s for the Lebanese App store of course. Nevertheless, Ghobril’s app “Mingle” has been <a href="http://www.appannie.com/apps/ios/app/851851633/app-ranking/#daily=2014-06-01&type=ranks">performing</a> quick well worldwide as you can see in the below screenshot. It reached the #4 rank in the productivity apps list in France and #5 in the UAE.</p>
<p>Moreover, Mingle has got some pretty cool reviews from Tech Crunch and Minimal Mac and others. Sarah Perez from TechCrunch described the app as “a cleaner and less sluggish type of contacts application”. I don’t know if I would make use of such an app but it’s definitely worth a try.</p>
<p>You can download it [<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/mingle-action-based-contacts/id851851633?ls=1&mt=8">Here</a>].</p>
<blockquote><p>Mingle was built from the ground up to make connecting with your contacts faster, easier, and more enjoyable in every way!</p>
<p>Some of Mingle’s greatest features:</p>
<p>Super fast & intuitive interface<br>
Numerous actions to fit your every need, from Phone to Twitter to Fantastical interactions<br>
Custom actions, where the possibilities are endless</p></blockquote>

Well, sort of.</div><div><br></div><div>Ever since I heard the news of a <i>Boys Meets World</i> sequel coming to life (back in November 2012), I got really excited. The show was an inspirational hit when I was growing up, and one of the few ‘90s shows that I still gladly watch in reruns on a late Sunday night. So the thought of seeing Cory and Topanga on my screen in 2014 seemed like a fan-fiction dream come true.</div><div><br></div><div>With this news though, came the dread that the new show might stink. While it still hasn’t aired on the Disney Channel (June 27), the pilot was released on Disney Now and can be found online.</div><div><br></div><div>There’s definitely a sense of nostalgia while watching <i>Girl Meets World</i> - seeing Cornelius (I just love saying that) and Topanga together on screen brings back beautiful flashbacks - but the entire show screams “Disney”.</div><div><br></div><div>The horrible, horrible laugh-track plus the tacky dialogue, the wacky characters, the very bright colors, the clothes and a lot more were just too “Disney” for my taste. Obviously, it had to be because unlike <i>Boy Meets World,</i> this show is aimed more at kids under the age of 15. I can’t see it going down the same road <i>BMW</i> took (no pun intended) simply because its predecessor tackled many serious issues and was more about life lessons than this show can possibly ever become. Also, how many times do you have to say the word “world” in the first episode? That was very lame.</div><div><br></div><div>Maybe <i>BMW</i>’s entire first season was just as goofy and Disney-like as the first episode of <i>GMW</i>, so that would mean the show could possibly become a hit (although I just can’t see it going that way). Either way, little things like the character of Farkle Minkus (yes, Minkus!!) was handled hideously. He was just an annoying little kid trying to be funny, but that scene with him randomly jumping on Cory’s back was beyond frustrating.</div><div><br></div><div>It helps that the lead character, Riley Mathews (C & T’s daughter), is likeable (but only a little) and her best friend, Maya (the new Shawn), is interesting enough to give this show another chance, but I only kept watching because I wanted to see more Cory and more Topanga (seriously, where was she during the rest of the episode?).</div><div><br></div><div>Luckily, they knew how to wow us with that final cameo appearance of Mr. Feeny, a scene that was incredibly moving (and has to be for any <i>BMW</i> fan) regardless of how short it was. That five-second moment made the entire episode worth it.</div><div><br></div><div><span><b>Quick Thoughts</b></span></div><div><br></div><div>- The opening song “Take On The World” is very catchy!</div><div><br></div><div>- So Cory and Topanga also have a son named Auggie who was barely seen in the first episode besides a small scene with Riley.</div><div><br></div><div>- Anything with Riley and Maya trying to talk to the new boy Lucas (obviously the love interest for Riley) was cringe-worthy.</div><div><br></div><div>- Many old faces will return for <i>GMW</i> including the much-anticipated return of Shawn (this shall be good!), Cory’s parents and brother, Stuart Minkus, Harley and Fee-ee-ny!</div><div><br></div><div>- I really thought Topanga became a stay-at-home mom, which is what it seems like from this episode, but Wikipedia says she does become a lawyer at that New York City law firm we heard so much about in the <i>BMW</i> finale! I’m a sucker for continuity, and so far this show is doing it well.</div><div><br></div><div>- So this episode was filmed in front of a live studio audience and yet we still have to bear that awful fake laugh-track?

<p><span><strong>I met Anas Chao first through a series of e-mails. He was a follower of this blog, and was going to be in Beirut and suggested we meet. We became fast friends and ended-up exploring the old souks of Sidon together. Anas speaks fluent Lebanese Arabic, resides in Taipei, but grew up in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, where his dad was stationed for work. He trained as a graphic designer but is  keenly interested in Lebanese cuisine. He is also a talented photographer. Watching  the locals’ delighted reaction when they would hear him address them in flawless Arabic was a sight to behold! </strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Back in Taipei, Anas started his own business, aptly called<a href="http://www.a-meal.com/"> A Meal</a>, in which he cooked private parties at his home studio for people interested in Middle-Eastern inspired cuisine.  Apparently there are no Middle-Eastern restaurants in Taipei. His business has been picking-up, as there are more people than he imagined who are amateurs of  this type of food. </strong></p>
<p><strong><span>I was really curious to see his menu, and he graciously gave me the recipe for the item that interested me the most. <em>Chicken in zaatar and tahini sauce</em>. I had to try it. Tahini sauce (tarator) and <em>zaatar</em> are not normally combined in Lebanon. What is more traditional is to mix tahini sauce with fresh parsley or cilantro. Turned out the combo is yummy! This is an easy and delicious meal. </span></strong></p>
<p><span><strong>INGREDIENTS: (slightly adapted)</strong></span></p>
<ul><li><span><strong>2 chicken breasts, cut into thumb-size</strong></span></li>
<li><span><strong>Marinade: 1 tablespoon mashed garlic, 1/2 teaspoon black pepper, salt to taste and 1 cup olive oil</strong></span></li>
<li><span><strong>1/4 cup zaatar</strong></span></li>
<li><span><strong>Tahini sauce: 1/2 cup tahini</strong></span></li>
<li><span><strong>1 large lemon, juiced</strong></span></li>
<li><span><strong>4 garlic cloves, mashed with salt</strong></span></li>
<li><span><strong>1/2 cup water or more as needed to make it smooth</strong></span></li>
<li><span><strong>2 tomatoes, sliced (or cherry tomatoes)</strong></span></li>
<li><span><strong>2 onions, sliced (or pearl onions)</strong></span></li>
</ul><p><span><strong>1. Marinate the chicken pieces overnight. The next day, drain and pan-fry the chicken (Anas baked it till done). Coat with the tahini sauce mixed with zaatar. Serve with tomatoes and onions. Anas roasted cherry tomatoes and onions in the oven, I sliced tomatoes and served them raw.  </strong></span></p>

<p>I rarely share press releases but this one is quite interesting and a major step forward for the Lebanese olive oil production. As you all know, Lebanon is renowned for its sprawling olive orchards yet hasn’t been doing well in the olive oil market mainly due to the high cost of production, its inadequate quality due to poor processing and of course the competition with cheaper non-Lebanese oils. </p>
<p>This being said, USAID and LIVCD (Lebanon Industry Value Chain Development) launched an initiative aimed at developing a seal to certify the quality and origin of Lebanese olive oil. The project “<a href="http://www.dailystar.com.lb/News/Lebanon-News/2014/May-29/258178-politics-economy-harm-lebanons-olive-oil.ashx">aims</a> to increase the productivity of olive trees by simultaneously lowering costs, standardizing milling and storage processes and creating incentives for the market to support Lebanese olive oil”. The seal will benefit the Lebanese olive oil sector by facilitating producers’ access to markets, while building consumer trust in both the quality and origin of the oil purchased. The LIVCD and IMC are expected to finalize and distribute the seal to certify producers, millers and bottlers, restaurants, and hotels in the coming months.</p>
<blockquote><p>Key actors in the olive oil sector in Lebanon gathered on May 29th, 2014 to launch an initiative to develop a seal to certify the quality and origin of Lebanese olive oil. The initiative is spearheaded by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) funded<br>
Lebanon Industry Value Chain Development (LIVCD) project in cooperation with the Mediterranean Institute of Certification (IMC). The event brought together seventy olive oil producers, mill owners, bottlers, exporters, and representatives from agricultural<br>
cooperatives. The seal will benefit the Lebanese olive oil sector by facilitating producers’ access to markets, while building consumer trust in both the quality and origin of the oil purchased. </p>
<p>In her opening words, LIVCD Chief of Party Dr. Jane Gleason explained: “Lebanese olive oil producers are facing major challenges in selling their produce and accessing local and export markets because of competition with cheaper non-Lebanese oils. Much of Lebanese oil is of<br>
inadequate quality due to poor processing. Lebanese consumers do not know for sure if they are buying oil of Lebanese origin, and if this oil is extra-virgin quality. The development and the promotion of the seal will open new opportunities for Lebanese olive oil and for<br>
extra virgin olive oil processors across Lebanon. USAID and LIVCD hope to achieve these objectives, with support from private sector investors” </p></blockquote>";s:17:"post_image_height";i:498;s:16:"post_image_width";i:780;s:11:"post_visits";i:10;s:18:"post_twitterShares";i:8;s:19:"post_facebookShares";i:22;s:16:"post_totalShares";i:30;s:16:"post_socialScore";i:24;s:13:"post_virality";i:27;s:9:"blog_name";s:11:"Blog Baladi";s:16:"blog_description";s:89:"a non-political Lebanese blog that tackles various issues related to the Lebanese society";s:8:"blog_url";s:21:"http://blogbaladi.com";s:11:"blog_author";s:11:"Najib Mitri";s:28:"blog_author_twitter_username";s:7:"LeNajib";s:13:"blog_rss_feed";s:27:"http://blogbaladi.com/feed/";s:9:"blog_tags";s:7:"society";s:2:"id";i:22;s:11:"blog_active";i:1;s:24:"blog_last_post_timestamp";i:1401739680;}i:7;O:8:"stdClass":26:{s:7:"post_id";i:30518;s:8:"post_url";s:106:"http://thepresentperfect.wordpress.com/2014/06/01/international-educator-interviews-jodie-in-buenos-aires/";s:10:"post_title";s:55:"International Educator Interviews: Jodi in Buenos Aires";s:10:"post_image";s:88:"http://thepresentperfect.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/cropped-8717690419_4a3dd75e7c_h.jpg";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:123:"Today’s interview features my dear friend Jodi whom I met during my time in Beirut.

The “Flying Burger” has been developed by a team of chefs using three different cuts of British beef — chuck, cheek and onglet.</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.nogarlicnoonions.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/ba-chef-mark-tazzioli-burger.jpg"><img src="http://www.nogarlicnoonions.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/ba-chef-mark-tazzioli-burger.jpg" alt="ba-chef-mark-tazzioli-burger" width="690" height="454"></a></p>
<p>It will be served with a side of triple-cooked chips and a choice of relishes, and will be available on long-haul flights. BA will also serve a “Grounded Burger” in its First and Concorde lounges. It will feature a different recipe for pre-flight dining.The Flying Burger’s ingredients include 100 per cent British beef, Monterey Jack cheese, gherkins, tomato relish and a brioche bun.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nogarlicnoonions.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/ba-burger.jpg"><img src="http://www.nogarlicnoonions.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/ba-burger.jpg" alt="ba-burger" width="690" height="499"></a></p>
<p>Mark Tazzioli, BA’s chef, said: “Burgers are experiencing a renaissance right now, with pop-up burger bars and food trucks opening in all the major cities. Burgers are the ultimate tasty satisfying treat and ‘comfort food’ we crave when flying.</p>
<p>“It has taken months of trials to ensure we get the perfect texture and succulence, not just for the British palate, but for the hundreds of other nationalities that fly with us.”</p>
<p><strong>He added: “As taste buds are affected at altitude, we have created an original patty, which has proven extremely popular in taste-tests.”</strong></p>

<div>Summary extracted from transcript:</div>
<div></div>
<blockquote>
<div><strong><strong>There’s enough water frozen in the ice sheet that feeds these icy giants to raise global sea levels by 4 feet if they were to melt. That’s troubling because the glaciers are melting.<br></strong></strong><br>
Moreover, a new study finds that their decline appears to be irreversible.</div>
<div>Rignot and colleagues have used 19 years of satelliteradardata to map the fast-melting glaciers.In their paper … theyconclude that ‘this sector of West Antarctica is undergoing a marine ice sheet instability that willsignificantly contribute to sea level rise’ in the centuries ahead.A key concept in the Rignot study is the ‘grounding line’ the dividing line between land and water underneath a glacier.
<p>Because virtually all melting occurs where the glaciers’ undersides touch the ocean, pinpointing the grounding line is crucial for estimating melt rates.</p>
<div><strong>In all the glaciers they studied, grounding lines were rapidly retreating away from the sea.</strong></div>
<div><strong>‘In this sector, we are seeing retreat rates that we don’t see anywhere else on Earth,’</strong>Rignot says.Smith Glacier’s line moved the fastest, retreating 22 miles upstream. The other lines retreated from 6 to 19 miles. As the glaciers melt and lose weight, they float off the land where they used to sit.<strong>Water gets underneath the glacier and pushes the grounding line inland. This, in turn, reduces friction between the glacier and its bed. The glacier speeds up, stretches out and thins, which drives the grounding line to retreat farther inland. This is a positive feedback loop that leads to out of control melting.</strong>
<p>‘At current melt rates,’ concludes Rignot, ‘these glaciers will be ‘history’ within a few hundred years.’</p>

This event comes packed with new Apple software from IOS to OSX, maybe some minor product update and some new partnerships.</p>
<p>So the Apple 2014 WWDC, What to expect? We rounded up a couple of stories and rumor so there you go!</p>
<h2>OSX 10.10</h2>
<p>Little is known about this new operating system but apple has confirmed that it will be demoed during the WWDC, but according to <a href="http://appleinsider.com/">Appleinsider</a> trademarks for the upcoming OS have been made! Including <em><span>OS X Sequoia, OS X Mojave, OS X Sonoma, and OS X Ventura<span> </span></span></em><span><span>each of which is a well-known city or geographic feature in California. So maybe that explains the banner spotted being set up for the conference.</span></span></p>

<h2><a href="http://www.taknologia.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/OSX-10.10-concept-560x307.jpg"><img src="http://www.taknologia.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/OSX-10.10-concept-560x307.jpg" alt="osx concept" width="560" height="307"></a></h2>
<h2></h2>
<h2>IOS 8</h2>
<p>Witch is not a surprise since every year Apple announces a new version of the mobile OS in the WWDC keynote. As usual updates will be made to the ever struggling maps app, of course the introduction of the<em> Healthbook</em> app a seeing that the Iphone 5s was fitted with a M7 motion co-processor that we have yet seen a good use for. Plus the inevitable integration of beats music service so maybe iTunes won’t suck anymore!</p>
<p> </p>

<h2><a href="http://www.taknologia.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/iOS-8-healthbook-511x450.jpg"><img src="http://www.taknologia.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/iOS-8-healthbook-511x450.jpg" alt="iOS-8-healthbook-511x450" width="511" height="450"></a></h2>
<p> </p>
<h2>Apple’s take on home automation</h2>
<p>What started off as something some what exiting turned out to be just boring old certifications that will be handed out by apple to device manufactures… Witch is somewhat identical to the “works with iphone” badge you can see on products that are sold on the apple site under Connected Home.</p>

<p><span>This one is a leak and it can be true as much as it can be false!  </span></p>
<h2>The Iphone 6</h2>
<p>We all know it’s coming we have seen the <a href="http://www.taknologia.com/apple-iphone-6-dummy-revealed/">leaked images</a> but according to <a href="http://www.nowhereelse.fr/iphone-6-video-wwdc-2014-98039/">nowwhererelase.fr</a> witch are in possession of a video that shows a slide that will allegedly be used for the presentation of the unveiling of the Iphone 6. The phone on the screen has that curved philosophy just like in the leaks, so how knows maybe it’s true!  Here is the video judge for yourself:</p>

<p><strong>Known for its rich variety of seafood, Floka, situated in the heart of the Al Aqaba was our choice for to enjoy our meal, we wanted a proper goodbye dinner to conclude this memorable trip.  For some good seafood Al Aqaba, a Jordanian coastal city is known to boast a few seafood restaurants… we went for Floka.<br></strong></p>
</div>
<div><img src="http://www.nogarlicnoonions.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Floka_Aqaba_Restaurant02.jpg" alt="Floka_Aqaba_Restaurant02" width="600" height="450"></div>
<div>
<p>Floka looks nice. A well decorated air-conditioned space, with the marine-like ambiance, gave off a good first impression. A reflective ceramic floor, wooden decorative items, a bar and two aquariums, all in a space filled with wooden tables and dark leather chairs. Enter from the main door where the fish display welcomes you on the left, all caught fresh that morning; Red Hammour, Farride, Hammour, Sultan Ibrahim, Dinnis, jumbo shrimp and shrimp covered with ice.</p>
</div>
<p>Floka offers a wide range of items, not only sea specialties. Soups, starters, oriental salad, fish dishes, seafood specialties, international dishes, rice dishes and desserts. Browsing was fun, I was happy to see the various items they offer and wished I could taste them all; stroganoff, siyadieyh, curried prawns, spaghetti and grilled meat.</p>
<div><strong>With Fayruz musical tunes playing in the background, we started lunch.</strong></div>
<div></div>
<div><img src="http://www.nogarlicnoonions.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Floka_Aqaba_Restaurant22.jpg" alt="Floka_Aqaba_Restaurant22" width="600" height="450"></div>
<div></div>
<div><strong><strong>Let’s eat:</strong></strong><strong>Let’s eat:</strong>
<ul><li>Moutabal, hummus, Turkish salad (tomato, chili pepper in red sauce), rocket salad and mixed Arabic salad were all good. An average taste that’s not extraordinary but acceptable. We started with those while waiting for the fish.</li>
<li>What caught my attention was the Turkish salad, which has a sweet and sour taste like a Chinese mix. Floating in red sauce, the diced pepper and tomatoes crunch before the sweetness appeared and followed by hidden spiciness that holds a long lasting aftertaste.</li>
<li>The bread, served hot, thicker than the ones we know, were fulfilling. The locals like their bread exactly the way they do it in the desert.</li>
<li>Kebbe with meat followed, as well as triangular cheese rakakat. Not bad for a local restaurant.</li>
</ul></div>
<div>
<p><img src="http://www.nogarlicnoonions.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Floka_Aqaba_Restaurant29.jpg" alt="Floka_Aqaba_Restaurant29" width="600" height="450"></p>
</div>
<div>
<p>After that, each of us had a platter of seafood mixed grill: Two king prawns, a “grilled” fish filet and some “grilled” calamari. I would have preferred if they called them fried instead of grilled. I would have enjoyed them for what they were… We received platters that were shining like a star… all covered in oil. The fish tasted dull and the oil was smelly. That was a big no for me. I had a bite and sent the rest back.</p>
</div>
<div><img src="http://www.nogarlicnoonions.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Floka_Aqaba_Restaurant41.jpg" alt="Floka_Aqaba_Restaurant41" width="600" height="450"></div>
<div></div>
<div><strong>The minuses:</strong>
<ul><li>Welcoming was not so appealing</li>
<li>Service was average</li>
<li>Food was not tasty</li>
<li>Plates were not appetizing</li>
</ul></div>
<div><strong>I’m not sure if I would recommend this restaurant or not. Coming to Al Aqaba to enjoy some fresh fish is a must but I’m sure other places as well consider themselves as a local culinary pride. I’ll skip this one next time and try something else.</strong></div>

Regardless of how long you’re in a country, it’s imperative to try and absorb something from that place. You never know when/if you may be there again, so you’ve got to take advantage of the chance to learn something new. You may not get a real feel for the destination – after all, 2 days is hardly enough to know a place – but you might still pick up a lesson or two.</p>
<p><strong>In Bucharest<br></strong><br>
I didn’t interact with the locals or the city too much due to work & weather. What I can say is that the Romanian <em>language</em> is quite lovely. A photographer told me about the roots of the language being a mix of Spanish & Italian with some Russian undertones and a pinch of Portuguese. Throw all those lyrical sounds together and you’ve got something beautiful that is a unique Eastern European Latin amalgam. Besides that, from the streets I did see, the overall city’s appearance has a decadent neglected charm. The architecture is inconsistent in that every street is a mismatched combination of industrial run-down buildings and heavily ornamented Art Nouveau beauties of earthy tones. It’s like seeing a small EDL building next to Miss Havisham’s house. But the thing that made the Bucharest trip hilarious was discovering this show on TV: BeastMaster, the Hercules/Xena LOWER budget version of Dr.Dolittle.</p>

<p><strong>In Moscow</strong></p>
<p>It seems that Russians have the reputation for being unfriendly straight-faced people. Turns out, this is a cultural misunderstanding. A smile in Russia is not something given to everybody. It must be a genuine smile given to people you know, not just a stranger you’re passing on the street or a customer you’re interacting with. You don’t know them so why should you fake a smile? It’s completely rooted in the historical culture that is reflected in the behavior of the people: old Russian sayings show smiling isn’t encouraged. </p>

<p>The Red Square is a must-see because you get a taste for the grandiose nature of what Russia represents. You’re surrounded by giant churches, the Kremlin, and a Gum (state department store). This Gum has a glass ceiling atrium that resembles the architecture of <a href="http://www.shorpy.com/files/images/3c18801u1_0.jpg">NYC’s Penn Station</a> in it’s glory days. St. Basil’s Cathedral, the famous Who-ville cupcake colored church-turned-museum that is a symbol of Russia, is worth seeing even if just from the outside. </p>

<p>I asked about a famous Russian dish that everyone’s teta would cook in a certain way. Basically, I was wondering what was the equivalent to our kibbeh. For some reason, I thought it would be beef stroganoff but it turned out to be Olivier salad. The basic Olivier salad is potatoes, boiled carrots, eggs, and peas with mayonnaise but it varies and is considered the necessity at the table when having large gatherings (especially New Year’s parties). It’s the Russian tabbouli, if you will. Stroganoff, on the other hand, became popular after a chef of the Stroganov family cooked it up. It used to be a luxury to have because of the price & availability of meat but eventually, it became a staple dish across the country and the world.</p>
<p>Some other tidbits from Moscow:</p>
<p>- Getting from place to place is very time consuming due to the large distances but mostly because of unpredictable traffic. You never know when a traffic jam is going to keep you stuck in a car for 40 min or 140 min. </p>
<p>- Married folk wear their rings on the right hand. Engaged folk may have a diamond involved just to show the difference but there’s no switching hands.</p>
<p>- Alexanders are nicknamed “Sasha”</p>
<p>- Roosters seemed to be popping up in various forms (decor in the hotel, lollipops in stores). My internet digging says they are a symbol of happiness and good fortune to Russians. Please correct me if you know otherwise.</p>
<p>- The Seven Sisters are a group of 7 skyscrapers in Moscow that have the same Stalin-architectural style. The skyscrapers were built in order to compete with capitalist cities. One is the Radisson Hotel, formerly known as Hotel Ukraina, which sits on the Moscow River. These particular skyscrapers are Gothic/Baroque but there’s some Burj Khalifa Dubai-esque style ones coming up though. </p>
<p>- Black bread, or rye bread, is common. It’s a very dense dark colored bread that’s high in fiber. It’s density is due to the chemistry of the rye and how it makes the dough rise. It’s supposed to be healthier than white bread. Personally, I wasn’t a fan. Unfortunately, I prefer fluffy bread that makes you fluffy too.</p>
<p>- Space Museum came highly recommended. I didn’t get to see it but it’s on the list!</p>

<p>It is a really must read (original post <strong><span><a title="The 8 Types of FIFA World Cup Fans You’ll Encounter In Lebanon" href="http://blogbaladi.com/the-8-types-of-fifa-world-cup-fans-youll-encounter-in-lebanon/" target="_blank"><span>here</span></a></span></strong>) because it prepares you for what is coming your way while watching the World Cup – Brasil 2014, in Lebanon.</p>
<p>I thought that many of the points listed in the article can be true describing football fans around the region, and not only in Lebanon. I was also triggered to add a couple more types to the original list.</p>
<p>Here are Najib’s original points (the first 8 – with some modifications) and mine are added towards the end:</p>
<ol><li><span>The loyal fan</span>: He loves and plays football, he’s been cheering for the same team for years and will never change sides.</li>
<li><span><span>The hardcore fan</span></span>: He’s pretty much like the loyal fan but his team is always right no matter what they do. Watching the games with these fans is not always fun.</li>
<li><span><span>The undecided fan</span></span>: He has the Italian, German and Brazilian flag on his car and is cheering for all 3 teams.</li>
<li><span><span>Girls who support Italy</span></span>: Taking aside those who are loyal fans, they support Italy just because the players are cute.</li>
<li><span>Guys who support Italy</span>: Taking aside those who are loyal fans, there are guys who support Italy just because a lot of girls do.</li>
<li><span><span>Portugal fans</span></span>: Because Cristiano Ronaldo is on the team.</li>
<li><span><span>Underdog teams fans</span></span>: They are either Lebanese born or living in these countries or have no favorite team and just like picking underdog teams.</li>
<li><span><span>The fan who likes “el le3eb el 7elo”</span></span>: He doesn’t want to support any team and just likes to watch games.</li>
<li><span><span>Glory Hunters</span></span>: Similar to number 8, but in a more annoying way. They support whoever is winning and getting the results, while claiming they have been supporting them before the inception of mankind.</li>
<li><span><span>Philosophical fans</span></span>: Mr. and Mrs. “there is more to life than football.” These fans have a hobby of repeating the same annoying line every time a match is on: “What is the benefit of wasting your time watching some men running behind a ball?”</li>
<li> <span><span>The Wannabe Encyclopedia</span></span>: These fans have two best friends; Google and Wikipedia. They insist on bringing them along to every match and showcasing their skills working with them to the general audience.</li>
<li><span><span>The Pundits and Coaches</span></span>: This is my favorite type. It is a fact that we all wish to be in any manager’s shoes at any given moment in time, but we all know that there are limits to our wishes. These fans do not believe in any limit, and their grandmothers are always better strikers and goalkeepers than who ever is playing.</li>
</ol><p> </p>

This is usually the prospective employer, who has to pay visa and flight costs and possibly an agency fee. It is an outlay that runs beyond the thousand dollar mark, and which assistant coordinator of the Migrant Community Center in Beirut, Rahel Abebe, says leads to a misplaced sense of ownership.</div><div>"Because they bring a woman in from another country - such as Ethiopia - they think they have bought her. They don’t understand they are paying for the process, they think they are paying for her."</div><div><strong>"Set of abuses"</strong></div><div><img alt="Migrant domestic workers on the street" border="0" src="http://www.dw.de/image/0,,15338016_4,00.jpg" title="Some 200,000 migrant domestic workers are employed by Lebanese families" width="330"><div>Some 200,000 migrant domestic workers are employed by Lebanese families</div></div><div>And that mindset leads to abuse which Human Rights Watch women’s researcher for the MENA region, Rothna Begum, says ranges from unpaid wages, confiscated passports, exhaustive working hours and no holiday or days off, to confinement, death threats, verbal, physical, and sexual abuse. And there is no legislation for them to turn to.</div><div>"Most migrant workers fall within the<span> </span><em>Kafala</em><span> </span>system, yet they receive the least protection under labor laws," she told DW.</div><div>In the case of domestic workers, who live where they work and may consequently be expected to be on call 24 hours a day, the lack of a legal framework can lead them to take potentially fatal action.</div><div>"There are cases of women who end up risking their lives by climbing out of buildings in which they have been confined," Begum continued. Those who succeed are deemed to have absconded, a status that brings with it another set of problems. "In a system which is designed to make workers complete their contracts, they cannot just leave and find another employer."</div><div>Although there are some small groups and NGOs on hand to help women who escape abusive employers, Ethiopian Rahel Abebe, herself a former domestic servant, says most workers are unaware of their existence. "If they run away, it takes them months to find an organization, so they live with friends or just somehow."</div><div><strong>"Second class entities"</strong></div><div>Lina Khatib, Director of the Carnegie Middle East Center in Beirut, believes the basic problem in Lebanon is that migrant domestic workers are not regarded as equal human beings but as "second class entities" without full social and human and economic rights. And she attributes this to an inherent sense of racism and superiority toward domestic work that harks back to the days of feudalism and Ottoman rule.</div><div><a href="http://www.dw.de/abuse-hardship-for-migrant-workers-in-lebanon/a-17626130#" rel="nofollow"><img alt="Construction site and crans in Beirut" border="0" height="191" src="http://www.dw.de/image/0,,17625614_404,00.jpg" title="Construction is booming in Lebanon, and many new flats are built with a servant in mind" width="340"></a><div>Construction is booming in Lebanon, and many new flats are built with a servant in mind</div></div><div>"It is a widespread problem that is shared across social strata, and it has become socially acceptable for migrant workers to be living the way they do."</div><div>Citing the new builds that are going up across the country as part of the booming real estate scene, Khatib says it is now standard practice to incorporate a dedicated "servant’s room" into modern apartments.</div><div>"Very often no bigger than 2.5 by 2m, they have no windows and they resemble prison cells, which shows that the livelihood of migrant workers is regarded as inferior."</div><div><strong>Tackling the problem</strong></div><div>Workers themselves and human rights groups agree that the only secure way out of the trap is via legislation, but in a country currently characterized by political paralysis and tensions that have spilled over from neighboring Syria, improving the lot of domestic servants is not at the top of the agenda. On the contrary, says Khatib, highlighting the influx of Syrians as a potential problem.</div><div>"There is a degree of resentment from certain sectors of the Lebanese population regarding the position of Syrian workers, so there is debate in some political circles to reduce their rights, which would have an indirect negative impact on migrant workers."</div><div><a href="http://www.dw.de/abuse-hardship-for-migrant-workers-in-lebanon/a-17626130#" rel="nofollow"><img alt="Syrian refugees in Lebanon " border="0" height="191" src="http://www.dw.de/image/0,,17538299_404,00.jpg" title="The influx of Syrian refugees is putting a strain on neighboring Lebanon" width="340"></a><div>The influx of Syrian refugees is putting a strain on neighboring Lebanon</div></div><div>Until the government can muster the political will necessary to draft and pass labor laws to protect the most vulnerable, it falls to civil society to continue campaigning for an end to the<span> </span><em>Kafala</em><span> </span>system that destroys dreams brought to the country in the battered cases of young girls.</div><div>"I don’t know why, but they want to use us for slavery," Rahel Abebe said.

<p>Mission<br>
The LAS mission is to advocate for the rights of individuals with Autism and to provide them and their families support and services, from early childhood to adulthood.<br>
<br>
1) What is Autism? An Overview<br>
Autism is a complex neurological disorder that impacts communication, behavior and social relationships, it is part of a group of disorders known as Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD).<br>
Today, 1 in 68 individuals is diagnosed with autism, making it more common than pediatric cancer, diabetes, and AIDS combined. It occurs in all racial, ethnic, and social groups. Autism affects boys four times more than girls.</p>
<p>2) Symptoms<br>
Symptoms can range from very mild to quite severe.<br>
As autism is a Spectrum disorder, symptoms can vary from mild to severe, and it will vary from one child to another, but there are some common symptoms, mainly in social and communication skills.<br>
•Lack of Social Interaction<br>
•Lack of Communication<br>
•Delayed or Unusual speech<br>
•Lack of Eye contact<br>
•Limited interest in Play or Inappropriate Play<br>
•Stereotyped behaviors. These may include body rocking and hand flapping.<br>
•Uneven gross/ fine motor skills<br>
•acts as deaf<br>
While many autistic people have terrific language skills, there are 50% of autistic people who have no language at all.</p>
<p>3) Identification<br>
Autism was first identified in 1943 by Dr. Leo Kanner of Johns Hopkins Hospital. At the same time, a German scientist, Dr. Hans Asperger, described a milder form of the disorder that is now known as Asperger Syndrome. These two disorders are listed in the DSM IV (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders) as two of the five developmental disorders that fall under the Autism Spectrum Disorders. The others are Rett Syndrome, PDD NOS (Pervasive Developmental Disorder), and Childhood Disintegrative Disorder. All of these disorders are characterized by varying degrees of impairment in communication skills and social abilities, and also by repetitive behaviors. </p>
<p>4) Disorders<br>
Autism Spectrum Disorders can usually be reliably diagnosed by age 3, although new research is pushing back the age of diagnosis to as early as 6 months. Parents are usually the first to notice unusual behaviors in their child or their child’s failure to reach appropriate developmental milestones. Some parents describe a child that seemed different from birth, while others describe a child who was developing normally and then lost skills. Pediatricians may initially dismiss signs of autism, thinking a child will “catch up,” and may advise parents to “wait and see.” New research shows that when parents suspect something is wrong with their child, they are usually correct. If you have concerns about your child’s development, don’t wait: speak to your pediatrician about getting your child screened for autism. </p>
<p><br>
5) Diagnosis<br>
If your child is diagnosed with autism, early intervention is critical to gain maximum benefit from existing therapies. Although parents may have concerns about labeling a toddler as “autistic,” the earlier the diagnosis is made, the earlier interventions can begin. Currently, there are no effective means to prevent autism, no fully effective treatments, and no cure. Research indicates, however, that early intervention in an appropriate educational setting for at least two years during the preschool years can result in significant improvements for many young children with Autism Spectrum Disorders. As soon as autism is diagnosed, early intervention instruction should begin. Effective programs focus on developing communication, social, and cognitive skills.</p>

<p>If you are an Alfa or Touch user and your cycle ended yesterday, then your 3G/4G plans were updated as of today.
