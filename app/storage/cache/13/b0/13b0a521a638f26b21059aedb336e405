But unfortunately, far too many apartments and even so-called villas of our day and age fit the caveman ticket at least in their exteriors. Cities today, just like the past 100 years have the flair of stacked caves that are crowded into buildings are deficient of character. They are structures built from primitive design or shortsighted greed, or both. Consequently, millions of buildings in thousands of cities are only theoretically conducive of social life and economic activity, lacking structural character that would support their owners and tenants in improving their lives.</p>
<p>Beirut also is stacked with buildings that create feelings ranging from distance to disgust, whether as fancy but wholly unimaginative towers or as barely functional boxes used for commerce, housing, leisure or education. But that is not the whole truth. There is not only a small and dwindling portfolio of heritage buildings that help the city to breathe civilization, there is also a small but growing stock of new buildings that represent ingenuity and some that even make us think — and perhaps help us think more constructively.</p>
<p>When Executive last month surveyed one such building, the new home of the Issam Fares Institute think tank on the grounds of the American University of Beirut, IFI director Rami Khouri said that the new building had immediately boosted his team’s ability “to do better work.” Part of this was due to the structure’s information and communications technology features and the high visibility that the building provided. But another part of the productivity gains derives from the building’s design and the conducive environment that it generates, Khouri said, inspiring staffers to conduct their “core activities with much greater enthusiasm.”</p>
<p>With a tip of the hat to the project owners, architects and developers that have invested themselves in unconventional projects, Executive has put together a selection of recently completed buildings that impress us as concepts, and which give us something to think about. Some may even be seen as entrenched, positive elements of the city’s fabric in 100 years time.</p>

The clamoring being heard from opportunists on all sides gives us reason to believe that madness inhabits the minds of many rulers and politicians who are trying to exploit the blood of Gaza’s heroes. This is the first time that concern is justified in this matter, because the issue here is not just about the calculation of Resistance fighters on the battlefield, but also about the calculation of those who can influence them, and those who are trying to hijack their achievements to use them as bargaining chips.</p><p>Because the issues are rather clear and unambiguous, it is necessary to abandon the preliminaries and deal with the major points:</p><p>- Concerning the Resistance forces, we have to acknowledge, with admiration, pride, reassurance, and hope, that what the Resistance fighters are doing in Gaza today is a qualitative leap in the performance of the Palestinian Resistance. Their conduct on the battlefield as well as on the political level portends good things of the kind we saw in Lebanon before.  </p><p>Concerning the Resistance forces, we have to acknowledge, with admiration, pride, reassurance, and hope, that what the Resistance fighters are doing in Gaza today is a qualitative leap in the performance of the Palestinian Resistance. Regardless of the nature of the decision to kidnap the three settlers in the West Bank, subsequent events indicate that the Resistance understood well the nature of the enemy and its measures.  The Resistance was quick to take precautionary measures and others to increase its readiness, thwarting the enemy’s traditional plans in hitting the Resistance cadres and assets. </p><p>While there are some among us who like to visit the past to warn, emphasize lessons, or attempt to get credit even if after the fact, the reality is that there are in Gaza Resistance heroes leading the most difficult battle with a most difficult and brutal enemy. These heroes have excelled not only at bringing in as many weapons and equipment as possible, but also at finding ways to develop their own weapons to haunt the enemy. While Hezbollah may have rockets that can destroy entire buildings at any location in historic Palestine, the Resistance fighters in Palestine can now force the residents of these buildings to evacuate, which is a psychological victory no less important than physical destruction. </p><p>Furthermore, the performance of the Resistance in the past few days underscores why it needs all the support it can get. Those who believe in the importance of shoring up the abilities of the Resistance must seek ways to support it with funds, equipment, and additional skills. The Resistance does not lack personnel, nor bright and innovative minds, and it does not need advice or lessons. It needs the wherewithal to manufacture weapons that can deter the enemy.</p><p>In addition, the measures of the Resistance in Gaza, and the measures by the Resistance cadres who captured the settlers, reflect high awareness, something that has led the enemy to a total intelligence failure. To this moment, the enemy does not know the answer to questions like: How do we deter the Resistance again? </p><p>- With regards to the Palestinian Authority and other factions in Palestine, the ongoing confrontations have shown that it does not make sense anymore to take part in any negotiations with the enemy. Estrangement with the enemy cannot harm the Palestinians anymore. Participation in negotiations no longer serves the advocates of a peaceful settlement. If the leadership of President Mahmoud Abbas still rejects armed resistance, this is certainly not the case for the popular base of the Fatah movement and other factions of the PLO. Unless these forces grow the teeth they need, through the forces of resistance, the enemy will not respond even to a phone call. </p><p>- Concerning the forces of the resistance axis, there have been some despicable attitudes voiced by some of their supporters, whether those who only see in Palestine and among residents of Gaza, people who differ with them in Syria or elsewhere, or those who link the future of the Resistance to what the axis alone decides. </p><p>There are worrying signs that have emerged in more than one place as well. We do not need to talk about Iraqi isolationism that refuses to pay attention to the Palestinian cause. There is no need to talk about the narrative of justification espoused by part of the supporters of the Syrian regime to say that the war on terror is the main issue. What Syrian President Bashar al-Assad said in his speech on Wednesday is relevant, as he reaffirmed the link between his and Hezbollah’s actions in Syria and the aggression on Gaza. </p><p>Even on the Hezbollah side, the performance of its direct media institutions – let alone those it is indirectly affiliated to – is incomprehensible vis-à-vis the events in Gaza. There is nothing to justify the subpar coverage of Gaza by a channel like Al-Manar, be it Ramadan and its programming, or other events in the world. </p><p>Today, we must restore not only the perception of Palestine as a central cause, but also the practice that reflects this conviction.- Regarding the Muslim Brotherhood camp, any attempt to exploit the victories of the Resistance to further its agenda in any other country will not work. The blood of the Resistance fighters cannot be used by those who have the closest relations with the enemy and the United States, and who are allies with colonialist Europe. </p><p>Those Muslim Brotherhood figures, including Hamas leaders, who try to claim that what is happening in Gaza is part of the Muslim Brotherhood’s pushback against their opponents in Egypt, Syria, the Gulf, the Arab Maghreb, and Yemen are deluded and foolish. Those who try to use what is happening in Gaza to blackmail the countries of the resistance axis, especially Iran, are delusional. Indeed, the relationship between this axis and the Resistance in Palestine no longer requires permission from anyone. Therefore, the Muslim Brotherhood camp must find other tricks to make its comeback. As for the countries that sponsor them like Turkey and Qatar, let them wash their dirt with something other than the blood of Gazans. Pompous and loud rhetoric is useless and worthless.  </p><p>- As for Egypt, especially under Sisi, the attempt to link its position on the aggression against Gaza to the implications of defeating the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt is politically shortsighted, if not foolish. Gaza will always remain part of Egypt’s strategically vital sphere of influence. </p><p>While the fools in the Gulf may be expected to think about taking over Egypt’s role in Gaza, it would be madness personified if anyone in Egypt comes to believe that Gaza is now part of the Arabian Peninsula. The political, security, diplomatic, and even humanitarian conduct of the Sisi administration reflects shortsightedness regarding Egypt’s role above all. This issue has to do with Egypt’s lost role. If Sisi and his team believe that “self-dissociation” on Gaza, or sitting idly by the bloodletting there, can help the cause of stability in Egypt or bring in more aid, then they would be returning to the three decades under the previous regime, which was allowed, in return for its inaction, to repress and rob its people, but nothing more.</p><p>Today, we must restore not only the perception of Palestine as a central cause, but also the practice that reflects this conviction. In Lebanon, the least we can do in this regard is release Sheikh Hussein Atwi and honor him, instead of dealing with him as a criminal who wanted to put Lebanon in a bad position! </p><p>Ibrahim al-Amin is the Editor-in-Chief of Al-Akhbar.</p><p>This article is an edited translation from the Arabic Edition.</p>";s:17:"post_image_height";i:495;s:16:"post_image_width";i:780;s:11:"post_visits";i:8;s:18:"post_twitterShares";i:0;s:19:"post_facebookShares";i:6;s:16:"post_totalShares";i:6;s:16:"post_socialScore";i:15;s:13:"post_virality";i:14;s:9:"blog_name";N;s:16:"blog_description";N;s:8:"blog_url";N;s:11:"blog_author";N;s:28:"blog_author_twitter_username";N;s:13:"blog_rss_feed";N;s:9:"blog_tags";N;s:2:"id";N;s:11:"blog_active";N;s:24:"blog_last_post_timestamp";N;s:6:"col_id";i:5;s:8:"col_name";s:36:"Ibrahim al-Amin at Al-Akhbar English";s:16:"col_media_source";s:17:"Al-Akhbar English";s:13:"col_home_page";s:37:"http://english.al-akhbar.com/node/125";s:13:"col_shorthand";s:8:"iaminakh";s:26:"col_media_source_shorthand";s:9:"al_akhbar";s:27:"col_author_twitter_username";N;s:8:"col_tags";s:20:"columnists, politics";s:15:"col_description";s:51:"Ibrahim al-Amin is the Editor in Chief of Al-Akhbar";s:23:"col_last_post_timestamp";i:1405602652;}i:2;O:8:"stdClass":36:{s:7:"post_id";i:32799;s:8:"post_url";s:104:"http://dailystar.com.lb/Opinion/Columnist/2014/Jul-16/263998-see-how-palestinians-depict-themselves.ashx";s:10:"post_title";s:38:"See how Palestinians depict themselves";s:10:"post_image";N;s:12:"post_excerpt";s:158:"Words matter.

They help us better understand our world and ourselves, especially at complex times such as this latest round of military attacks by Israelis and Palestinians.</p><p>The prevalent global analysis of the fighting is inadequate for anyone who seeks seriously to grasp the three critical dimensions of the fighting – its causes, nature and consequences. </p><p>None of those three dimensions is addressed by the facile nature of politicians’ statements or mainstream media analysis, which tend to emphasize rockets fired by Palestinians from Gaza, Israel’s right to defend itself against such attacks, and speculation about a possible cease-fire or an imminent Israeli ground attack into Gaza.</p><p>Words can help, and in this case it is worthwhile to examine the words that Palestinians use to describe themselves, if we are seriously interested in understanding the core issues that define this conflict. These have manifested themselves since the 1930s in so many different ways, all leading back to a basic issue: The battle between Zionism  and Arabism in Palestine, more particularly the battle between the rights of a Jewish-majority state of Israel and a dismembered and exiled Palestinian community that continues to struggle for its national rights.</p><p>The two leading Palestinian political and military groups that have mobilized their supporters over the past decades are Fatah  and Hamas.  Fatah was founded and for a long time headed by Yasser Arafat, and controls the Palestine  National Authority that manages the West Bank under Israeli tutelage. Hamas came into being in the early 1980s and has dominated the Gaza Strip  for several years now. </p><p> Fatah is a peculiar acronym that comprises, in reverse order, the first three letters of the movement’s name in Arabic, which is Harakat Tahrir Filistin, or the  Palestine Liberation Movement. Hamas is an acronym in Arabic for its full name, which is Harakat al-Muqawama al-Islamiyya, or the Islamic Resistance Movement. The two most important words in their names are “tahrir” and “muqawama,” or “liberation” and “resistance.” In the etymology of Palestinian nationalism, “liberation” and “resistance” are enduring emotional sentiments and political dynamics, because they largely define the nature of Palestinian identity and goals. They are the most important things to understand about how Palestinians feel and behave.</p><p>The once-dominant and vital  Fatah movement has become a sad shell of its former self, with some very bright and patriotic leaders who have totally lost touch with their people in  Palestine and abroad. Hamas has risen to the fore in recent decades mainly because it has more faithfully reflected the will of Palestinians to resist their occupation and subjugation, and to seek liberation and a normal life in their own sovereign state. Hamas’ core mission is “resistance,” whether through military actions that have little impact on Israel or by trying to organize Palestinians politically to improve their living conditions while they await eventual liberation.</p><p>Hamas is a heroic tragedy, simultaneously admirable and sorrowful. It is heroic for many Palestinians because it persists in resisting Zionism’s desire to eliminate Palestinian nationalism and identity as real forces that demand respect and can be manifested in some kind of national sovereignty in Palestine. “Resistance” to Hamas supporters and others means many things at once. It means consistently asserting the Palestinians’ national rights and the need to end their refugee status. It means constantly challenging the oppressive status quo that Palestinians suffer, especially in Gaza. It means consistently increasing Hamas’ technical capabilities in rockets, drones and communications, allowing it to inconvenience Israel more effectively with every new round of fighting.</p><p>Yet Hamas is also tragic because its strategy and tactics both result in repeated mass suffering by Palestinian civilians in the  Gaza Strip and sometimes elsewhere as well. The state of Israel, being the sovereign manifestation of Zionism, has repeatedly shown that it will viciously attack, assassinate, imprison and imperil all Palestinians – in Palestine, Lebanon or elsewhere – to maintain its hold on the land of Palestine. It is possible that Hamas’ long-term strategy of patient steadfastness and continuous resistance will succeed one day in forcing Israel to accept its terms, but that remains only a slim possibility, while the reality is that millions of Palestinians suffer the burden of repeated Israeli attacks on their homes and communities.</p><p>Exiled and subjugated communities such as the Palestinians today usually behave in ways that seem strange to middle class consumers in faraway lands – including fighting apparently futile battles and subjecting their populations to prolonged suffering and death. This can only be understood by appreciating the nature of “resistance” and the allure of “liberation.” That means analyzing the Israeli-Palestinian conflict as a battle between Zionist power and Palestinian liberation that has gone on for almost a century. </p><p>Rami G.

In the coastal zone of suburbia stretching north of the capital, new commercial and residential hubs have formed in the past few years and are still a focus of development activity in the Dbayeh area and on hillside sprawls. In earlier real estate coverage, Executive reported on the retail ventures and mall developments aside the coastal highway, and on the master-planned developments such as Majid Al Futtaim Waterfront City and Beit Misk above Antelias.</p>
<p><span>These development hotspots are part of the Metn district, as are the string of eastern suburbs closest to Beirut that comprise the municipalities of Sin El Fil, Bourj Hammoud, Dekwaneh and the combined municipality of Bauchrieh, Sed El Bauchrieh and Jdeideh. </span></p>
<p><span>These heavily urbanized districts have seen developments of major road infrastructure, with construction at the Mkalles knot currently nearing completion. Other key road developments of the past ten years were the Hayek–Salome and Nahr El Mott interchanges.</span></p>
<p><span>The area contains one high-profile hotel complex in the two Habtoor properties adjacent to the Qalaa intersection in Sin El Fil, which were completed by 2005. These high-rises have defined the skyline of the eastern suburbs since that time, and it was only recently that other new towers were announced for the area. The FourtFour tower is a mixed used project managed by developer Sayfco that is going to be constructed near the Salome intersection, and the Miknas Plaza is a two tower project not far from the Qalaa intersection in Sin El Fil.</span></p>
<p><span>These mixed-use projects were first announced last year and both can be expected to have major impacts on the eastern urban belt directly next to Beirut proper. However, according to Plus Properties, the promoter of Miknas Plaza, the project is still waiting in the wings a year on, and its actual launch is yet to take place. By all indications on the ground, the FourtyFour site is also in its earliest excavation phase and the project is a good number of years away from completion.</span></p>
<p><strong>Structural challenges</strong></p>
<p>Industry sources say that a handful of modern residential projects in the nearer eastern suburbs encountered strong demand and sold out even while the property market started to slow after 2011. The recent indications for property transaction<span>s are interpreted as indicators that the slump in the market is tapering out, and developers might again begin to accelerate their activities if other positive signals arise in support of increasing market confidence.</span></p>
<p><span>At the same time, the structural challenges of the eastern suburbs will not be diminishing. Collaboration of municipalities in a Greater Beirut urban planning exercise appears to be a phantom of wishful thinking, according to the absence of a strategic or at least comprehensive response when one contacts the largest municipality in the suburbs, that of Bauchrieh–Sed el Bauchrieh–Jdeideh, which has about 150,000 inhabitants. </span></p>
<p><span>Two visits with a member of the municipal council to talk urban planning left much to be desired. A council member who declined to go on record gave Executive a CD with a presentation meant to answer questions on forward thinking and the municipality’s planning for future developments. While it highlighted completed road works and efforts to train municipal police officers in traffic control strategies, lacking was any discussion of plans to work with developers who say they are keen to exploit any land they can buy in the area.</span></p>
<p><span>An exploration of the suburbs by car and on foot at this time only reveals how the construction of traffic arteries has made it — at times — easier to travel the suburbs, but urban development of gree</span><span>n spaces appears to be at best cosmetic throughout the entire area between the southern border of Sin El Fil and the eastern edge of Jdeideh.

<p>But strangely, in the year’s 28th week, Gulf investors seem to have been inoculated against all confidence-eating bugs.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.executive-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/20140714-indices-week-28.png"><img src="http://www.executive-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/20140714-indices-week-28.png" alt="Stock index performance" width="300" height="522"></a></p>
<p><strong>Summer heat</strong></p>
<p>For the second week running, upward arrows dominated the weekly performance sheets of benchmark indices in the Middle East and North Africa. The top riser was the Qatar Exchange, followed by the Dubai Financial Market. Index gains on both bourses slowed down only slightly when compared with the improvements achieved in week 27, but the advancements made so far in July must be regarded in context of the index devastations seen in June on several exchanges in the Gulf Coordination Council.</p>
<p>Moreover, the DFM’s weekly gain was in reality a one-day affair on July 6, followed by sideways trends in the rest of the week. Abu Dhabi’s ADX General Index similarly settled into a lull. The QE index on the other hand moved up steadily during the week. However, the drop in the DFM’s vigor deserves noting, given that the recent tumbles and regroupings of the Dubai, Doha and Abu Dhabi markets have been credited mainly to the DFM as the (not so) prime mover.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, equity players in the United Arab Emirates will not have been horribly surprised by a report that the creation of a joint securities exchange is not likely to happen in the near future. Given that the multiyear on-and-off tale of a merger between ADX and DFM has not seen new developments in a few months, <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/07/10/us-emirates-exchange-mergers-idUSKBN0FF0UT20140710" target="_blank">Reuters revisited</a><a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.reuters.com%2Farticle%2F2014%2F07%2F10%2Fus-emirates-exchange-mergers-idUSKBN0FF0UT20140710&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNEoQro8mlzSBWwl-YvcIUg1D5Yjgg"> the story</a> and quoted unnamed sources saying that the issue “has been shelved.” Sources contended, however, that the merger will come to pass at some point, “if not now, later.” In other words, nil change to the status quo.</p>
<p>The region’s largest market, Saudi Arabia’s Tadawul, staged a repeat performance of the previous week with a 1.2 percent gain. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected to see corporate earnings of major Saudi stocks improve on average 10 percent year-on-year for the second quarter, up from 7 percent in the first quarter — making the TASI one of the Gulf’s steadier upward performers in the first two weeks of July, along with Oman’s MSM 30.</p>
<p>The EGX 30 index for the Egyptian Exchange was the week’s third best gainer after Qatar and Dubai. More than on equities, economic attention on the Nile appeared however to be focused on recently introduced austerity measures, especially a hike of up to 78 percent in prices for gasoline and diesel that, <a href="http://www.thenational.ae/world/egypt/egyptians-digest-bitter-pill-as-fuel-prices-soar" target="_blank">according to a report by Abu Dhabi-based The National</a>, resulted in lots of popular grumbling but no major incidents.</p>
<p><strong>Solidere leaves solid ground</strong></p>
<p>Of twelve MENA markets in Executive’s purview, only one — Beirut — dropped in week 28. The BLOM Index was led down by real estate stock in a week when the BSE reported $6.8 million in traded value.</p>
<p>Dropping 2.7 percent to below $13 per A share, the share prices of property developer Solidere fell for a second consecutive week. <a href="http://www.dailystar.com.lb/Business/Local/2014/Jul-08/263001-solidere-profits-surge-148-percent-in-2013.ashx#axzz37MQ8VfCb" target="_blank">A report in the Daily Star newspaper</a> cited unnamed sources saying that the company was not expected to pay dividends for the past year after Solidere on July 7 released audited results for 2013.</p>
<p>Driven by a 91 percent year-on-year improvement in land sales to $95 million, the company reported consolidated net income of $42.6 million. The 2013 net result was the firm’s second lowest in the past five years but it represented a notable improvement from $17.2 million in 2012. The company’s annual general meeting has been scheduled for July 21 after a first AGM call in June did not result in a quorum.</p>

It was only temporary. I&#x2019;ll take it down tomorrow.&#x201d;</p><p>I had spotted the beginning of the pipe at the border of my fruit orchard near the upper road, and with more than a little of that ugly indignation that middle age can so easily summon up, I began pulling it up to see where it led, feeling like Alec Guinness at the moment he discovers the explosives in the final scene of The Bridge on the River Kwai . I followed it through the trees, over my garden, across the lower road and down to a plot of land where Walid, recently returned from years of working in West Africa, had built a greenhouse.</p><p>I&#x2019;d had a vague idea he was up to something but wasn&#x2019;t sure what exactly. People told me he was preparing charcoal, others that he was growing exotic fruits. Now I was going to find out.</p><p>But any confrontation over the errant pipe was defused by his unreserved apology. So much so that I felt now that I was there I should at least show some interest in his new venture. &#x201c;Take a seat,&#x201d; he said motioning to a wooden bench, and we both sat down in front of the centrepiece of the greenhouse, a steel frame loaded with an irrigation system of plastic pipes bored through with multiple holes, each one holding a mini-flowerpot, out of which sprouted magnificent lettuces of various shapes and sizes.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m growing three kinds at the moment,&#x201d; he said, staring at the mass of leaves. &#x201c;When I finish, I reckon I will have nine of these frames and in total I can grow 100,000 lettuces a year. They are organic, so I can hopefully sell them at a premium. If I can sell them to the market at a $0.80 or even $1.00 each, I&#x2019;m happy. If it works then I&#x2019;ll expand,&#x201d; he said gesturing to the unused land around his greenhouse. &#x201c;With two more of these then I can really begin to do something interesting.&#x201d;</p><p>We sat in silence, as if willing vegetables to grow. He lit a cigarette, taking in a very deep and unorganic drag. &#x201c;People thought I was crazy,&#x201d; he said exhaling. &#x201c;Not that I care what they think, but now they are slowly becoming more curious and seeing the potential.&#x201d;</p><p>Admittedly when it comes to that famous Lebanese entrepreneurial flair, the village does lack vision. A few years ago, I encouraged the creation of a properly branded cooperative for all sorts of village produce but the idea was shot down amid hoots of laughter and the amazement that I could, even for a moment, entertain the idea that the good folk of Zabbougha could ever work together.</p><p>Walid laughed. &#x201c;All they want to do is sit around all day and smoke shisha.&#x201d; He stood up and stubbed out his cigarette. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t afford to do that. I have to work, and let&#x2019;s face it there are no job opportunities these days so I figured why not start something for myself. I don&#x2019;t need that much to live on but there are always bills to pay. I&#x2019;ve had it with Nigeria and Ghana; one can only spend a certain amount of time there. Now I have peace and quiet and when I come down here and look at my lettuces I&#x2019;m happy.&#x201d;</p><p>I asked if anyone had called the police, suspecting he didn&#x2019;t have a permit. &#x201c;At least three times, but I know what I can and can&#x2019;t do when it comes to the law. The cops come, we have a friendly chat and then they go. It&#x2019;s all silly and a waste of time.&#x201d;</p><p>I stood up to go. &#x201c;Here, let me give you a lettuce,&#x201d; Walid said, picking out one from the rack. &#x201c;This is a good one. Tell me what you think. Can I just ask that you to give me back the pot? I have to send off to China for them.&#x201d;</p><p>Michael Karam is a freelance writer based in Beirut </p><p></p><p>Follow us on Twitter @Ind_Insights</p>";s:17:"post_image_height";i:0;s:16:"post_image_width";i:0;s:11:"post_visits";i:5;s:18:"post_twitterShares";i:2;s:19:"post_facebookShares";i:0;s:16:"post_totalShares";i:2;s:16:"post_socialScore";i:8;s:13:"post_virality";i:6;s:9:"blog_name";N;s:16:"blog_description";N;s:8:"blog_url";N;s:11:"blog_author";N;s:28:"blog_author_twitter_username";N;s:13:"blog_rss_feed";N;s:9:"blog_tags";N;s:2:"id";N;s:11:"blog_active";N;s:24:"blog_last_post_timestamp";N;s:6:"col_id";i:6;s:8:"col_name";s:29:"Michael Karam at The National";s:16:"col_media_source";s:12:"The National";s:13:"col_home_page";s:109:"http://www.thenational.ae/apps/pbcs.dll/search?q=*&NavigatorFilter=[Byline:Michael%20Karam]&BuildNavigators=1";s:13:"col_shorthand";s:8:"mkaramtn";s:26:"col_media_source_shorthand";s:12:"the_national";s:27:"col_author_twitter_username";s:15:"Lebanesewineman";s:8:"col_tags";s:20:"columnists, politics";s:15:"col_description";s:40:"Michael Karam is a writer and journalist";s:23:"col_last_post_timestamp";i:1405336293;}i:7;O:8:"stdClass":36:{s:7:"post_id";i:32621;s:8:"post_url";s:102:"http://dailystar.com.lb/Opinion/Columnist/2014/Jul-12/263625-colonialism-never-ended-in-palestine.ashx";s:10:"post_title";s:36:"Colonialism never ended in Palestine";s:10:"post_image";N;s:12:"post_excerpt";s:157:"As we commemorate the 100th anniversary of the start of World War I, we can get a better understanding of the conditions of that time by following closely...";s:7:"blog_id";N;s:14:"post_timestamp";i:1405116461;s:12:"post_content";s:5289:"<p>As we commemorate the 100th anniversary of the start of World War I, we can get a better understanding of the conditions of that time by following closely events in Palestine  this week.</p><p>That is because Israeli behavior provides the best window we have into the mindset of the Western colonial powers a century ago, when foreigners with superior military equipment and an equally grand sense of their own national superiority killed, occupied, jailed, slaughtered, and exiled Arabs at will, treating them more like animals than human beings.</p><p>What we are witnessing today is Israel  behaving against Palestinians much as the French, British and Italian colonial powers behaved against Iraqis, Syrians, Egyptians, Algerians and Libyans a century or more ago. In its colonization of Arab lands and its raw military savagery against civilians,  Israel gives us the best history lesson available of the conduct of colonial powers who treated natives as servants or subversives without rights, and who dealt with them primarily by repeated shows of force. </p><p>Without the explanatory lens of colonial behavior, I can think of only two ways to understand how  Israel can repeat every few years what it is doing now in Gaza, unleashing the power of its advanced military machines against an essentially helpless civilian population that has neither a means of escape nor shelters from the nonstop bombings from the air. Either Israelis are incredibly stupid people who do not grasp the futility of their repeated attacks that never seem to bring about the acquiescence, passivity and servility they seek from the Palestinians; or they are pathological killers who relish the sight of bombed Palestinian homes, weeping mothers and the burned and dismembered bodies of dozens of children. </p><p>I know that Israelis are neither of these things. They are normal people like all other people. So why do they keep doing what they are doing now, such as dropping 400 tons of explosives on defenseless Gazan families in 36 hours? Why do they do this and then return every few years to doing the same thing, always seeking to stop the Palestinians’ armed resistance against Israeli occupation and siege, but never succeeding? </p><p>They do all this because they are locked in perhaps the longest running colonial confrontation in the world, between Jewish nationalism-Zionism  and Palestinian Arab nationalism. They are acting exactly like all other colonial powers did toward the locals they conquered during the 18th and 19th centuries. This conflict started in the late 1890s with the First Zionist Congress’ call for the establishment of a Jewish national home in  Palestine and the promotion of Zionist settlements in that land that was over 90 percent owned and inhabited by Palestinian Arabs. For 120 years now, Jewish  Zionism and Palestinian Arabism have clashed, and  Zionism has prevailed militarily and in other ways, but  Israel treats Palestinians who resist its power and its aims like dogs. </p><p>Zionism’s conflict with the indigenous Palestinian Arabs is now into the sixth generation, and counting. The 1.5 million Palestinians of 1947 are now around 8 million, and counting. They are all resisting in their own ways – never forgetting who they are and where they came from, never accepting their dispossession and exile, never acquiescing that they must somehow live eternally in their own Babylonian exile.</p><p>Seeing Israel- Palestine and the wider Middle East today through the lens of the destructive consequences of colonial excesses helps us better understand the two dominant phenomena of the region today: the long-term instability and continuing conflicts sparked by colonial adventures a century or more ago, in the Middle East and other parts of the South; and the lingering tensions and violence in Palestine-Israel, which continue in an unbroken legacy from 19th century colonial practices.</p><p>Many anti-colonial movements around the world ultimately ended White Western tutelage over vast expanses of the globe – except for Palestine, where the descendants of indigenous Arabs today still battle the descendants of immigrant Zionists (the small indigenous Jewish community that had lived in  Palestine for centuries was always part of the local culture, and was not seen as alien or threatening, because they were not alien or threatening, or colonial in their mindset). </p><p>The delayed consequences of colonialism include the astounding varieties of political and sectarian violence and chaos that we are witnessing across the region, most viciously in Syria, Iraq, Libya, Algeria and others lands that had been colonized by European powers and then ravaged by their own incompetent and vicious military rulers. These tumults, and the savage battles in Palestine-Israel, suggest that the colonial era has never really ended, and that we are still suffering the ugly consequences of White men from the North with powerful guns and fighter planes who feel they can kill thousands of darker people from the South with total impunity – and come back and do it again three years later, and again three years after that. </p><p>Rami G.

However, from the perspective of Hamas and Islamic Jihad, the fighting until now has allowed both to attain a number of political and military objectives at a crucial time in inter-Palestinian relations.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The latest Gaza war has been very different from previous ones by virtue of the weapons the Palestinian groups have deployed. Whereas Hamas and Islamic Jihad mainly bombed Israeli localities near the Strip in the past (because their weapons didn&rsquo;t allow otherwise), today they have the capability of targeting Israeli cities such as Tel Aviv and Jerusalem.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Plainly, a significant rearmament effort took place during the years of chaos in Egypt after January 2011, with Iran apparently the main supplier. Syrian long-range M302&nbsp;rockets&nbsp;have also made their way into Gaza, probably through Iranian or Hezbollah channels, though that remains to be confirmed.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This signals that Hamas has rebuilt its relationship with Iran since the two parted ways over the conflict in Syria. Hamas had an interest in this. It has lost much revenue over the past year, since the removal of Egyptian President Muhammad Morsi, because the authorities in Cairo (effectively Egypt&rsquo;s military) closed most of the smuggling tunnels into Gaza. These tunnels&nbsp;earned&nbsp;Hamas some $200 million annually in tax revenues.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The current conflict shows Iran the value of its Palestinian ally while allowing it to test its weaponry. Though Israel&rsquo;s Iron Dome air defense system has been successful in shooting down longer range rockets, Hamas&rsquo;s implicit message is that as the quality of its weapons improves, Israel&rsquo;s success rate in protecting its cities will decline and casualty rates will rise.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>That may be true or it may not be. With Abdel Fattah al-Sisi now president of Egypt, Hamas&rsquo;s ability to import better arms will continue to be hindered. However, for Hamas the question is one of perception. The movement saw its relative power decline in recent months, and if it can show, as it has, that its military capabilities have improved, that goes a long way toward reversing the appearance of growing ineffectiveness.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In fact, Hamas sees Gaza as a means of underscoring the political marginalization of Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas. With the failure of the American-sponsored &ldquo;peace process&rdquo; evident to everyone, Abbas&rsquo;s credibility has been severely damaged. Nor have Palestinians, angry as they are with Israel&rsquo;s continued refusal to compromise over its settlements, regarded Abbas&rsquo;s collaboration with Israel favorably.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>While Hamas may not bring Palestinians many gains by launching rockets at Israel, the movement&rsquo;s actions in recent days contrast sharply with Abbas&rsquo;s futility. Hamas is seen as having retaliated for the killing of a Palestinian youth (and may have provoked that killing if indeed it was behind the murder of three Israeli teenagers). It forced Israelis everywhere to flee by bringing the war to their doorsteps. This has resonance with a Palestinian population suffering daily from Israel&rsquo;s occupation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It is conceivable that, in the long term, the latest round in Gaza will help impose new thinking in Israel. There is a line of reasoning that the only way to make Israelis accept a new template for dealing with the Palestinians is to show them that their occupation will only bring escalating risks. Therefore, with Israeli cities now under attack, the only long-term solution with the Palestinians is to end the occupation and make peace.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>That may be true, but neither Hamas nor the Israeli government has shown much inclination to embrace that logic. Hamas may have&nbsp;changed&nbsp;with regard to a Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza, but&nbsp;&nbsp;it still refuses to recognize Israel. This means that it does not really see the Gaza conflict as part of a wider process of negotiations leading to an eventual settlement, while its efforts to undermine Abbas, who can talk to the Israelis, reduces the likelihood of a successful negotiating track.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>For now, Hamas&rsquo;s priorities appear to be less ambitious: to show how vulnerable Israel has become; to reinforce its ties with Iran, restoring a source of financing and improved weaponry; and to show how irrelevant Abbas and Fatah are, allowing Hamas to eventually take control of the Palestinian national movement.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The fact is that Israel has few means to respond to this. Israel&rsquo;s international standing has taken a hit in recent years, with its right-wing government widely viewed as unwilling to make any concessions for peace. At the same time, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu offers no alternative project out of the deadlock, even as his assumption that there is a military solution to the Hamas problem is rejected even in Israel.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In other words, Hamas benefits from the political bankruptcy of Israel&rsquo;s government. Netanyahu may order his troops into Gaza in the coming days, but even if he does, then what? Holding on to the territory is hardly an ideal option, while destroying buildings and then leaving will only ensure more of what we have today.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If Israel&rsquo;s short-term goal is to push the international community to isolate Hamas, then this has probably failed. Most governments, even the Obama administration, have accepted Hamas in a Palestinian unity cabinet. If the party emerges stronger after Gaza, many governments will not want to ignore it. In other words, Netanyahu&rsquo;s strategy will have backfired.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We will see in the coming days if Hamas&rsquo;s sense of accomplishment is justified. The movement has learned from Hezbollah that merely surviving an Israeli onslaught can be played up as a victory. As for Netanyahu, what does he need to do short of destroying Hamas to declare an Israeli victory? It&rsquo;s not at all clear. That&rsquo;s why Hamas feels so confident.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Michael Young is opinion editor of The Daily Star newspaper.

Today, we are living through the sectarian response to Iran’s sectarian strategy throughout the region. The potential consequences are frightening, and we are already seeing the precursors of this in Syria, Iraq  and Lebanon. </p><p>There has been much debate over whether the Islamic State of  Iraq and Greater Syria  (ISIS) represents a majority of Sunnis, particularly in Iraq. The question is naïve. ISIS  almost certainly does not represent most Sunnis, but nor did the Bolsheviks in 1917 Russia. Vanguard movements are not often democratic in nature. They seize the initiative during periods of social and political vacuum, rapidly mobilize supporters against established orders and, before anyone has had time to react, create dynamics in their own favor before systematically eliminating their rivals.</p><p>The Iranians should know this more than anybody else, since that is how Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini  came to power and ultimately consolidated his authority after the revolution. And it is what  ISIS is doing today in Iraq, this week having started to arrest Saddam-era Sunni military officers in Mosul, in order to ensure that no political counterweight can emerge. </p><p>In Iraq,  Syria and Lebanon, Iran  bolstered Shiite or Alawite regimes or parties that sought as best they could to marginalize the Sunni community. This has now blown up in Tehran’s face.  Iraq is breaking apart, Syria’s regime is pursuing an active policy of partition and Hezbollah is facing an increasingly dangerous Sunni challenge in Lebanon  that it will not be able to contain. Only in Yemen are Iran’s favorites making headway, and even then, for every action there is usually an equal counterreaction. </p><p>The Lebanese situation is especially alarming. While most of Lebanon’s Sunnis  have no patience for ISIS, they are caught between two very disturbing realities: The absence of a moderate leadership on the ground that can contain the more radical elements in the street; and a perception among many in the community that the regional sectarian tide is turning, so that the million and a half Syrian refugees in the country, most of them Sunnis, are regarded as a welcome addition in the perceived struggle with Hezbollah and the Shiites. </p><p>This is extremely worrisome, because if Lebanon’s  Sunnis are pushed in a direction where extremists impose on them an abandonment of coexistence, the country will be finished. </p><p>Should  Sunnis come to be dominated by their radicals, sectarian dynamics will once again kick in. Lebanon’s Christians and Shiites will almost certainly move closer together in a shared reflex of self-preservation. Those  Sunnis who are happy today with the Syrian refugee presence should beware: In 1975 the community took a similar attitude toward the Palestinians, and, similarly, regarded the Lebanese Army as doing the work of its political foes. The results, as we know, were calamitous. </p><p>But Hezbollah is hardly innocent. For years the party was warned that its reckless policies and acts of intimidation after the Syrian withdrawal in 2005 would only exacerbate sectarian relations. But it was all hubris from Hezbollah, culminating in the party’s military takeover of western Beirut and its attacks in the mountains against the Druze in May 2008. Hezbollah continued on this path long afterward, entering the Syrian conflict to help Bashar Assad’s regime crush a mainly Sunni uprising, helping to import the Syrian war into Lebanon. </p><p>The Sunni genie is out of the bottle, and there is little Hezbollah can do about it. The party is too involved in  Syria on behalf of its Iranian sponsors. Even in the ongoing war in Gaza, Hezbollah hardly qualifies as an afterthought, as Hamas and Islamic Jihad  show Tehran what they can do with its rockets. </p><p>What does this tell us about Iran’s hubris? The Mideast is a graveyard for grand projects of hegemony, and if America failed we shouldn’t be surprised that  Iran is doing the same. The Islamic Republic backed the maximalist, sectarian policies of Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki in  Iraq and Assad in Syria, precipitating the disintegration of both countries. Iran, too, is multisectarian and multiethic and may not be shielded from the aftershocks. </p><p>It’s easy to believe in a cataclysmic scenario for the region. What makes one so conceivable is the fact that sectarian animosities are grafted onto a body of failed Arab states, where democracy, economic development and any redeeming sense of personal and social amelioration have been frustrated for decades. There seems to be no way to resolve differences except through repression of the other. And on those rare occasions when conciliatory policies might have been adopted and sectarian coexistence reinforced, precisely the opposite was done. </p><p>The so-called Arab Spring broke the back of the old order of supposedly secular dictatorships, but failed to bridge the gap toward more democratic and pluralistic entities. Today we are caught in a political no-man’s land – with neither the security offered by the dictators nor the representativeness of pluralistic systems. </p><p>The Middle East is at a foundational moment in its history, one perhaps more momentous than the post-World War I period when the region’s contours were redrawn. The optimists will say that all change brings something better. But until that time it will bring a great deal that is worse, as regional states come to the realization that their arrogance and irresponsibility has released forces with the potential of devouring them. </p><p>Michael Young is opinion editor of THE DAILY STAR.

We have already had three Palestinian intifadas against foreign domination – in 1936-39, 1987-90, and 2000-01, so we should more accurately talk about a possible fourth intifada. </p><p>I suspect, however, that this is not the likely or best outcome from the Palestinian perspective. Many expect a new intifada mainly because they cannot imagine Palestinians generating a different, more effective response to their national subjugation, since their views of Palestinians are restricted to helpless people who can only go on strike or throw stones at Israeli troops.</p><p>The Palestinian perspective is very different, for several reasons. The most important is that we have had two intifadas against Israeli occupation and they have generated no significant results in terms of liberation or national rights and reconstitution. Also, intifadas are like civil wars. A country usually only has one, very occasionally two, but never more than that, because such cataclysmic national events cannot be repeated over and over while the situation remains unchanged. Israel  uses massive and disproportionate military force and cruel collective punishment against Palestinians who challenge its hold over them, and we see in this week’s attacks against Gaza  that Palestinians who resist  Israel can expect to get killed, bombed, injured, jailed and see their homes destroyed in large numbers – with total impunity for Israeli actions that in most other situations in the world would elicit calls for war crimes investigations.</p><p>The two previous intifadas generated no lasting improvements in Palestinian national rights due to both the intransigence of Zionism and the incompetence of the Palestinian leaderships headed by Hamas  and Fatah  in  Gaza and the West Bank.  Hamas and some other smaller resistance groups have demonstrated an impressive capacity to keep firing small rockets and explosive projectiles against southern Israel, despite the decades of massive Israeli air and ground attacks against Gaza. It seems that repeated Israeli attacks like the one underway now only fortify Hamas’ determination to resist, and increase its technical ability to protect it rocket launcher sites. Like all colonial powers,  Israel seems to miss the fundamental rule that greater oppression only elicits more fierce resistance. </p><p>The problem for  Hamas and armed resistance groups, however, is that their policy has not improved the lives of Palestinians, but only made them more difficult. The same goes for Fatah’s two-decades of uninterrupted negotiations with Israel, which similarly have not achieved Palestinian national rights or improved living conditions. Translating popular anger into a new intifada on the streets in the context of these same Palestinian leaderships that dominate today would be a futile effort of mass emotional and political self-expression, with no consequence other than more violent and increasingly racist Israeli reprisals. </p><p>As long as Palestinians are hobbled by their Israeli-induced fragmentation, occupation, isolation, siege and economic strangulation, and their own current incompetent leaderships, they will find it very difficult to generate a more effective response to their sustained pain and vulnerabilities. Yet alternatives to this condition have already appeared here and there in contemporary Palestinian political action. </p><p>The three most significant options are mass nonviolent civil disobedience (which has only been tried sporadically, as in tax revolts); a global boycott and sanctions movement akin to the anti-Apartheid strategy against racist South Africa (which is expanding, albeit very slowly); and diplomatic-legal action through the United Nations  and other international institutions that promote the rule of law and self-determination (which is now possible for Palestine  as a nonstate member of the U.N., but, inexplicably, has not been tried seriously). </p><p>Progress in these three arenas ideally should happen simultaneously, and would certainly elicit powerful international support. It could also generate serious soul-searching among Israelis who would have to finally accept the limits of their military power and colonial control mechanisms. </p><p>One day, somehow, an effective Palestinian national leadership will emerge that could mobilize all Palestinians and their many supporters around the world and channel their energy into political actions that could achieve meaningful results.  Fatah and  Hamas have failed to do so, failing to build on the amazing foundation of mass popular resistance and mobilization that was handed to them twice during the last two intifadas. </p><p>Palestinians know this, and are too smart to repeat a valiant feat in which mass popular resistance was matched only by ineffective leadership, sharper Israeli colonial assertion, and a mostly indifferent or distracted world. </p><p>Rami G.

The Dubai Financial Market — home of the <a href="http://www.executive-magazine.com/business-finance/finance/market-crash-and-burn" target="_blank">Arabtec scandal</a> that triggered a <a href="http://www.executive-magazine.com/business-finance/finance/arabtec-dubai-market-fall-from-grace" target="_blank">pummelling of markets</a> over the previous weeks — saw its benchmark index advance 4.2 percent amid trading volumes of more than 1 billion shares in three sessions, far above its 50-day average.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.executive-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/20140707-indices-week-27.png"><img src="http://www.executive-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/20140707-indices-week-27.png" alt="Stock index performance" width="300" height="522"></a></p>
<p>On the Qatar Exchange, the index gain was even higher at 4.7 percent and in Abu Dhabi, the uptrend was 2.3 percent. Both exchanges saw higher volumes on the first three days of July when compared with daily volumes in the previous two weeks.</p>
<p>Other markets in the Middle East and North Africa displayed index fluctuations of lesser intensity but with a preponderance of gains; the only drops, at 0.3, 0.5 and 0.5 percent, were registered in Bahrain, Beirut and Morocco.</p>
<p><strong><strong>Shopping for confidence</strong></strong></p>
<p>Dubai closed the week marginally better than 20 percent down from its May 14 peak, allowing definition purists a new round of debate whether the recent downturn constitutes a bear market. Arabtec, whose board ventured to reassure investors and observers in a rare press conference on July 2, recovered at least somewhat from the onslaught of doubts that had almost erased the stock’s year-to-date price gains by its June 30 close. While still deeply wounded and having much trust yet to restore, the company showed a net weekly gain of 13.5 percent in the week.</p>
<p>In mature stock exchanges, when the going gets tough, the tough — meaning informed investors with enough cash on hand and a contrarian strategy — tend to go shopping. In the Dubai setting, the maxim seems to read a bit differently: when trust is in doubt, announce a mall. The latest big news aiming to boost trust in the emirate was an elaboration of the Mall of the World project in the Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum City megaproject, named after Dubai’s ruler and majority shareholder in the Dubai Holding company that owns the mall project.</p>
<p>According to a July 5 <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dubaiholding.com%2Fmedia-centre%2Fpress-releases%2F2014%2F407-mohammed-bin-rashid-launches-mall-of-the-world-a-temperature-controlled-pedestrian-city-in-dubai&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNFzSeibaNZCbldw0ucxk_HTPwjHeg" target="_blank">press statement</a> by Dubai Holding, the new mall will be the world’s largest, at 8 million square feet (743,000 square meters) but that is not the big news. The mall will be embedded into “the world’s first temperature-controlled city,” the announcement said. This 4.5 million square meter project will be located along Sheikh Zayed Road in Dubai. Temperature control will apparently be achieved via a protective cover, namely “a glass dome that will be open during the winter months.” Cost and implementation timeline of the venture were not included in the statement.</p>
<p>It was not all malls that spelled potential for new market boosts in the region, though. Tadawul, the Saudi bourse, saw the TASI climb 1.2 percent — perhaps with a whiff of optimism from neighbor markets but entirely without a new entry into the books for breaking new construction records. Toward the end of the week, the Saudi market was invigorated by second quarter results news, highlighted by petrochemicals giant Saudi Basic Industries Co’s (SABIC) dividend announcement of SAR 2.5 ($0.67) per share for the first half in 2013 that represented an increase of SAR 0.5 from the same period in 2013. Other better-than-anticipated results for the second quarter came from Saudi Hollandi Bank, Riyad Bank and dairy producer Almarai after the week’s market close.</p>
<p><strong><strong>Egypt’s budget</strong></strong></p>
<p>In the region’s most populous country, Egypt, week 27 brought a couple of upward sessions to the Egyptian Exchange after the government announced an austerity budget containing what was described as a planned deficit equal to 10 percent of GDP for the new fiscal year 2014–15, which started on July 1.</p>
<p>Reuters <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fuk.reuters.com%2Farticle%2F2014%2F06%2F29%2Fuk-egypt-budget-approval-idUKKBN0F40UF20140629&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNFXCbmPAYKc-iYZ7Rl6xJOIE9TtZQ" target="_blank">cited</a> a statement saying that Egypt’s planned deficit would be EGP 240 billion ($33.5 billion) after a reduction from EGP 292 billion ($40.8 billion) in an earlier budget draft that was rejected by President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi. The World Bank <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fdata.worldbank.org%2Fcountry%2Fegypt-arab-republic&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNEHQf8nteX-ku0p6JbwRoRH_rDCQQ" target="_blank">estimated Egypt’s GDP was $272 billion</a> in 2013.</p>
<p>The new budget’s EGP 52 billion deficit reduction was to be achieved by a combination of subsidy cuts and higher taxes, some of which were announced during the week. Tax increases include levies on capital gains and stock dividends, along with efforts to tax Egypt-based companies and professionals who incur revenues outside of the country. The bulk of savings, however, is to be realized via lowering of subsidies for diesel fuel and electricity.</p>
<p>Minister of Finance Hani Qadri Demian <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sis.gov.eg%2FEn%2FTemplates%2FArticles%2FtmpArticleNews.aspx%3FArtID%3D78623%23.U7qkf_mSzXw&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNHg_3-Y-H54A9CLwZD5GBWvNhculQ" target="_blank">announced</a> that Egypt aims for annual economic growth rates of 4 to 5.8 percent in the three fiscal years ending in June 2018, up from an expected growth of 3.2 percent in the just-started fiscal year, according to the country’s State Information Service.</p>
<p>Most notable news pertaining to the Beirut Stock Exchange was a reminder that the BSE has been slated for transformation into a joint stock company and gradual privatization under the <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bdl.gov.lb%2Flaws%2Findex%2F5%2F32%2FLaws.html&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNFSlvcc4UvAVjdtB4w5_kMinhQ50A" target="_blank">2011 Capital Markets Law</a>. This reminder was based on remarks by central bank governor Riad Salameh at a conference in June, but unfortunately came in the form of a haplessly transcribed, non-fact-checked and very carelessly edited interview of BSE vice president Ghaleb Mahmassani by an English-language Beirut daily.</p>

<p>Some restaurants airing the games had indeed noticed lesser volume of people since the start Ramadan, compared to the first week of the game, as people tend to eat more at home during the first week of the month. While admitting that their venues in Verdun and Hamra were less busy than the first week of the games, Rita Saati, marketing officer at Roadster Group, says their other locations compensated for this and they didn’t have a major cumulative decrease in sales or volume, making them satisfied with their venues’ performance during the World Cup thus far.</p>
<p>Most bars and clubs in Beirut are experiencing the annual slump that comes with the onset of the Ramadan when many practicing Muslims abstain from drinking alcohol. Yet the World Cup games, especially as the competition intensifies, are drawing out more crowds than usual for this period. Toni Rizk says his bars, Gatsby and Nu, were fully booked for the Germany–France game, but says that Uruguay Street as a whole had been less busy since the onset of Ramadan — which he says was expected, while the suicide bombings caused the typical decrease in customers on the nights they occurred.</p>
<p>While the semifinals and finals may bring crowds to Beirut’s bars despite Ramadan, it is to be noted, however, that the owners Executive spoke with say the increase in footfall that the World Cup brings to their venues has not translated into an increase in revenues, and that they usually just break even during the World Cup period, considering the investment they put into getting the broadcasting equipment and rights.</p>
<p>Shisha-serving cafes, which usually fill up during Ramadan — and even moreso now that people have football to watch as well — are examples of venues able to capitalize on the World Cup–Ramadan overlap.</p>
<p>Raouche’s Dardashat Café boasts a waiting list for the 11:00 pm games from now until final game, while for Beb El Az in Verdun, the World Cup period is the fullest they have been since opening three months ago. “We fully returned the investment we put into the World Cup during the first period and made a name for ourselves as the destination in Verdun thanks to the games,” says Bilal Daouk, Bab El Az’s manager on duty, explaining that people like to come after the evening <em>iftar</em> meal, have a shisha and watch the game on the giant screen on their wide terrace.</p>
<p>Ramadan or not, explosions or not, it seems that the Lebanese are determined to enjoy what is left of the 2014 World Cup — and hospitality venues are just as determined to make a profit during this holy season.</p>

In fact, I once, as kids do, or at least did, threw a stone, which accidentally glanced off his head. As you can imagine, he was none too impressed and that night, probably because I felt bad, I fessed up to my mortified father, who marched me round to Nabil&#x2019;s house to apologise.</p><p>It was a bad move. The next day, Nabil, who as kids do, had forgotten about the incident, told me that, instead of resolving the matter, his father later beat him for causing such a fuss.</p><p>Nabil and I still laugh about the incident and, though I doubt his late father&#x2019;s belt had anything to do with it, he is a very unflappable man. Until it comes to football, that is. Once every two years, come the Fifa World Cup and European Championships, Nabil becomes rabid in his support for Germany&#x2019;s national football team, and the prospect of his beloved mannschaft reaching yet another final on Sunday has left him positively foaming with excitement.</p><p>But Lebanon would not be Lebanon if there weren&#x2019;t an added smidgen of anxiety in all this. You see, at the best of times, our village gets its evening power from 6pm to midnight on alternate nights. The World Cup semi-finals are scheduled to start at 11pm, so Nabil, who doesn&#x2019;t have a generator, knows that unless Electricit&#xe9; du Liban is feeling generous, he will miss either the first or second half of the game with Brazil.</p><p>And EDL is not in a giving mood these days. The company has announced that it can no longer maintain it&#x2019;s &#x201c;regular&#x201d; service, which in real speak is 21 hours a day in Beirut and around 10 to 15 hours a day elsewhere, depending on where you live. It needs an extra US$266 million to meet the extra demand created by the 1.5 million extra people we have welcomed from Syria and all those new homes built across the country during a rampant construction boom.</p><p>So how are we coping? Well, those who have them are making do with generators, private or communal, which of course creates an extra financial burden to end users. Generators are also hardly environmentally friendly but, more worryingly, at the communal end of the market they have become a semi-legitimate sector in their own right. (Indeed, one wonders what will happen to these now powerful cartels if and when &#x2014; a very big &#x201c;if&#x201d; and an even bigger &#x201c;when&#x201d; &#x2014; the country does fix its chronic power problem.</p><p>But they needn&#x2019;t worry. The complacency of the state is staggering. The energy minister Arthur Nazarian, like his predecessors, is powerless to do anything meaningful, but he really shouldn&#x2019;t have insulted our intelligence last week by casually prefixing a statement on the situation by saying &#x201c;until we get 24-hour electricity&#x201d;, as if Lebanon was experiencing a temporary blip rather than a quarter-century stain of shame on successive corrupt and inept governments.</p><p>But back to the football. I wrote that at the start of Brazil 2014 many Lebanese, my buddy Nabil included, were faced with the prospect of not being able to watch any of it, unless they signed up for a package from Sama, a local satellite provider that had the local broadcast rights.</p><p>Then, at the eleventh hour, the telecoms minister Butros Harb announced that his ministry had set aside $3 million from mobile telecom revenues to pay Sama for the right to air the games on Tele Liban, our unfashionable and underfunded state-run TV channel. It was a deal that, we thought, ensured that anyone with a TV could watch the global tournament free of charge.</p><p>But the next thing we knew was that Sama was suing TL for showing the games without permission. So what was the $3m for? It turns out, from what most of us can gather, that it was to allow Sama to distribute the rights to the many &#x201c;grey&#x201d; market satellite providers that serve about 75 per cent of the homes in the country.</p><p>Or looked at another way, the state used its money to perpetuate the livelihoods of what are essentially pirate operations. Talal Makdessi, a former advertising honcho and the current director general of TL, saw the insanity of the deal and is currently daring Sama to do its worst.</p><p>Meanwhile, back in the village, Nabil in his usual relaxed way has rationalised that he can&#x2019;t change the madness that is Lebanon. He just wants to fire up his nightly shisha and watch a bit of football with his wife and kids. It&#x2019;s not a lot to ask.</p><p> </p><p>Michael Karam is a freelance journalist based in Beirut </p><p></p><p>Follow us on Twitter @Ind_Insights</p>";s:17:"post_image_height";i:0;s:16:"post_image_width";i:0;s:11:"post_visits";i:10;s:18:"post_twitterShares";i:3;s:19:"post_facebookShares";i:0;s:16:"post_totalShares";i:3;s:16:"post_socialScore";i:15;s:13:"post_virality";i:9;s:9:"blog_name";N;s:16:"blog_description";N;s:8:"blog_url";N;s:11:"blog_author";N;s:28:"blog_author_twitter_username";N;s:13:"blog_rss_feed";N;s:9:"blog_tags";N;s:2:"id";N;s:11:"blog_active";N;s:24:"blog_last_post_timestamp";N;s:6:"col_id";i:6;s:8:"col_name";s:29:"Michael Karam at The National";s:16:"col_media_source";s:12:"The National";s:13:"col_home_page";s:109:"http://www.thenational.ae/apps/pbcs.dll/search?q=*&NavigatorFilter=[Byline:Michael%20Karam]&BuildNavigators=1";s:13:"col_shorthand";s:8:"mkaramtn";s:26:"col_media_source_shorthand";s:12:"the_national";s:27:"col_author_twitter_username";s:15:"Lebanesewineman";s:8:"col_tags";s:20:"columnists, politics";s:15:"col_description";s:40:"Michael Karam is a writer and journalist";s:23:"col_last_post_timestamp";i:1405336293;}i:15;O:8:"stdClass":36:{s:7:"post_id";i:32381;s:8:"post_url";s:75:"http://blog.octavianasr.com/2014/07/tough-as-nails-and-not-in-good-way.html";s:10:"post_title";s:39:"Tough as nails... and not in a good way";s:10:"post_image";s:0:"";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:123:"In any business that involves human interaction, you are bound to run into clients you deem “difficult.” In fact, di...";s:7:"blog_id";s:11:"octavianasr";s:14:"post_timestamp";i:1404698400;s:12:"post_content";s:403:"In any business that involves human interaction, you are bound to run into clients you deem “difficult.” In fact, difficult people are everywhere in every aspect of life, including in business.

These events are especially noteworthy, however, because they happened in Kuwait, and because they keep happening there every few months.</p><p>The importance of the Kuwait  situation in my mind is enormous, for several reasons that transcend the borders or sentiments of  Kuwait itself.  Kuwait continues to reveal the fundamental political grievances of citizens in a small, quite homogeneous and wealthy Arab country that has also enjoyed a relatively lively public political sphere for many decades, including an elected parliament and a boisterous press sector.</p><p>For several years now thousands of Kuwaitis have regularly taken to the streets to demand a more rigorous government response to allegations of corruption, mismanagement and an unrepresentative parliament. Protesters also represent different discontented groups in society, such as young people, tribal groups, Islamists, nationalists and leftists, and not only the tribal followers of the jailed leader, in this case former parliamentarian Mussallam Barrak. </p><p>The particularities here are that the  Kuwait public prosecutor earlier this week ordered the detention of Barrak for 10 days after he was questioned and accused of publicly slandering and insulting the supreme judicial council. His hearing in court is set for July 7. Barrak and others accuse former senior officials, including ruling family members, of stealing and laundering tens of billions of dollars.</p><p>The charges have led to street demonstrations rather than vigorous parliamentary debates because most opposition groups are no longer represented in parliament, which they boycotted in protest against an amended electoral law that they feel favors pro-government majorities. The citizens who are demonstrating – gassed, sometimes beaten, and in some instances jailed – embody a critically important dynamic that has defined the uprisings across the Arab world in recent years: the insistence by ordinary citizens that they have rights, that they can peacefully demand those rights in public, that they can achieve those rights through political action, and that they can engage their national leaderships in a political debate that touches even sensitive issues such as corruption by members of ruling families. </p><p> Kuwait highlights the new reality that Arab citizens are now demanding rights from their governments simply on the basis of being entitled to those rights, and not necessarily because they are poor, suffer uneven access to social services, or have been politically abused and oppressed, as was the case with uprisings in countries such as Egypt, Libya, Bahrain and Syria. </p><p> Kuwait also speaks of deeper discontents among other citizens in oil-rich Gulf states who can only express their grievances through websites and social media. This is evident in several Arab countries, which, like Kuwait, try to suppress public political accusations and grievances, even by jailing individuals who Tweet sentiments that are critical of state policies. </p><p>The demonstrators in  Kuwait are not calling for the overthrow of the regime, but rather for constitutional political reforms. The demonstrators this week chanted their demands to reform the judiciary. When such basic, reasonable and non-violent demands are almost totally ignored across most of the Arab world, citizens have only a few options, including expressing themselves through social media or via pan-Arab satellite television, or by taking to the streets. As with almost every other public protest throughout the world, the actual number of citizens on the street is not the most important factor. </p><p>It is irrelevant if 500 or 15,000 demonstrate one night. What matters is that groups of citizens speak out in public on a regular basis, and address their complaints directly to the national leaders. It is likely that those who do take to the streets – for instance, recently in Ukraine, Turkey, Thailand or Burma – represent much deeper and wider legitimate societal grievances that require a political resolution through dialogue, negotiations and credible representation and accountability. </p><p> Kuwait remains for me the most fascinating country in the Arab world today because the contestation of its citizens is purely political, rather than ethnic, sectarian, economic or social. </p><p>This contestation also reflects grievances that have defined the entire Arab region for several generations now.  Kuwait should be the breakthrough country in the Gulf that mirrors the constitutional advances that Tunisia achieved in North Africa – a peaceful transition to constitutional democratic pluralism that others will applaud and emulate across the region. </p><p>Rami G.

The legislation will be applied worldwide, but in many countries it has raised legal issues since Fatca can violate domestic legislation. Lebanon, whose banks have readily&nbsp;embraced&nbsp;Fatca, is one such place.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In reality, Lebanese banks didn&rsquo;t have much of a choice. Fatca has been imposed by the United States on banks and other financial institutions internationally, obliging them to report to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) on their American account holders with accounts above $50,000. If the financial institutions are deemed non-compliant, 30% of their gross payments from American payers are to be withheld. This can be onerous; hence, all financial institutions whose transactions go through the United States have no alternative but to accept Fatca.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>What this means specifically is that at the end of every year banks will inform the IRS about their American clients, reporting the total sums in their account, interest, and transactions. In that way, the IRS believes, it will become extremely difficult for Americans overseas to underreport, or not report, their income in order to evade taxes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>However, there are several problems with Fatca. One involves principle. The legislation mandates hitherto-unprecedented intrusion into the private affairs of Americans overseas. Few things are more private than an individual&rsquo;s personal financial accounts or business relationships, and what Fatca does is to tear away the blanket of privacy and demand that foreign financial institutions effectively spy on their American clients.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>There are two very clear messages in the Fatca legislation, and they are quite disturbing: the first is that the American government does not trust its own citizens, and therefore will push them into a surveillance system operated by foreign entities; and second, that no financial institution &ndash; or country &ndash; has the latitude to refuse to implement Fatca because the United States could close off their access to the American market. For anyone transacting in US dollars, this is the kiss of death.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In other words, Fatca is effectively an instrument of financial imperialism, while also being a very blunt mallet used against America&rsquo;s own citizens. For critics of Fatca, a democracy should not be engaging in such wanton behavior, especially as the highly invasive oversight it imposes on Americans&rsquo; accounts would never be accepted by citizens in the United States.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But there is also something else: Fatca forces countries to ignore their own legislation, and the IRS knows this. In many countries, reporting on bank accounts, particularly to a foreign authority, is not legal. While that may be changing in a world where governments are increasingly agreeing to an exchange of financial information on citizens and are hunting for tax revenues, it suggests there is more to Fatca than meets the eye.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In Lebanon, for instance, banking secrecy remains in place, even if it has been gradually eroded over the years. There is also a legal principle known as the &ldquo;right to an account,&rdquo; which means that banks cannot deny an individual an account. While these principles have been imperfectly applied, they yet remain foundations of the Lebanese banking system and speak to the more fundamental liberal philosophy underpinning it.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Fatca undermines both. The reporting conditions effectively deny banking secrecy to Americans, who are obliged to waive their right to confidentiality. And if American clients refuse to waive that right, their accounts can be declared recalcitrant and banks can choose to close them. This, in turn, is contrary to the right to an account principle enshrined in Lebanese law.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But Fatca also imposes extra-territorial conditions. If an American is married to a Lebanese citizen and the two hold a joint account, the financial institution must report on both account holders. That means Lebanese banks are tasked with reporting on the transactions of Lebanese clients simply because they are married to Americans. From a legal perspective this is highly dubious, and could push Lebanese to demand that the authorities apply the law and protect them from IRS scrutiny.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It is to clarify such legal ambiguities that the United States has signed what are known as inter-governmental agreements, or IGAs, with foreign countries, to circumvent their domestic legislation. Many governments have gone along with this, but Lebanon has not signed an IGA. What this means is that financial institutions in the country are likely to be maneuvering in a legal gray zone for the foreseeable future.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The banks&rsquo; attitude has been realistic. Between the dire threat of American financial retaliation and the need to respect Lebanese law, they have regarded the former as the greater priority. And the Central Bank has not persuaded them otherwise, telling the vulnerable Lebanese banks to deal directly with the IRS.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Given the unevenness of Lebanon&rsquo;s judiciary, rare are those who go to court to challenge legislation. That&rsquo;s why banks prefer to focus on the present, while waiting to address any legal challenges when and if they present themselves.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As for the American authorities, they care not at all about the effects of Fatca. . Foreign banks have paid large sums of money to be compliant, and will defer most of the costs onto their clients. How strange that the US Treasury, in order to enforce American tax law, has imposed an onerous system demanding that other countries disregard their own legislation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Michael Young is opinion editor of The Daily Star newspaper.

He can say whatever he wants, no matter how foolish or contradictory, and still retain the backing of a substantial number of Christians.</p><p>Take Aoun’s latest proposal for a presidential election. The general called earlier this week for the president to be elected in two rounds of popular voting. In the first, Christians alone would vote. Then the top two candidates would go on to a second round, where all Lebanese – Christians, Muslims and others – would choose a president. </p><p>At the same time, Aoun again declared his support for the so-called Orthodox proposal, in which each religious sect would elect only its own parliamentarians. His rationale was that, under the current 1960 law, most Christian parliamentarians were being brought in by Muslims. “This is not fair,” Aoun said. “When every religious group elects its own officials, we are ensuring justice and fair representation.”</p><p>So essentially, we have two proposals that apply opposite principles. When it comes to the presidency, Aoun is willing to give the clear Muslim majority in Lebanon  the power to bring in a Maronite president, in that way bypassing Parliament, where Christians and Muslims are represented equally. But when it comes to parliamentary elections, Aoun intends to neutralize the Muslim majority that he will otherwise empower on the presidency.</p><p>It all makes perfect sense. Of course, Aoun would argue that the key lies in the two-stage presidential process, which presumably gives Christians the right to filter their two leading candidates in the first round. Perhaps, but the scheme, aside from raising serious legitimacy questions in a consociational system, is such that there are no guarantees either candidate will represent a majority of Christians, let alone that the winning candidate will. Far more significant is that Aoun opens the door to the principle of allowing Lebanon’s Muslim majority to effectively use its numbers to determine political outcomes. That means undermining confessional parity in the post-Taif institutions, which Christians regard as a protection, given their minority status.</p><p>With Aoun, we learned long ago that duplicity in the service of self-interest is no vice. More than any other Christian politician, he helped destroy his community, along with Samir Geagea, in the last years of the Lebanese war, in what began as a struggle against a Syrian regime he now backs. Aoun can still rally communal support, but this tells us more about the desperate mindset among Christians than about the man’s merits. </p><p>Aoun’s proposal has been panned, and understandably so. What is it about Aoun and Geagea that in the past year has made them back election proposals, presidential or parliamentary, that, while they may bring them some political benefit, are destined to harm Christian interests in the long term? The Christians can no longer afford politicians who mobilize them in their internecine battles. </p><p>For now, the most startling embodiment of Maronite fortunes is the absence of a president. And once again, Aoun has been pushed into the forefront of a confrontation in which he counts for relatively little. In reality, the agenda is being set by Hezbollah, with Aoun a useful facade to delay a final decision on a president and probably to protect the party’s favorite candidate.</p><p>Aoun, no idiot, senses this, and is trying to exploit what limited margin of maneuver he has to force the issue on his candidacy. But it is clear that Saad Hariri, even if he wants to maintain a good relationship with the general, has no Saudi backing to endorse Aoun. Walid Jumblatt has also sought to block Aoun, fearing that any Aoun-Hariri rapprochement would jeopardize his own balancing act in the center of the political spectrum, while ultimately threatening his authority in the Chouf.</p><p>Hezbollah  has allowed this situation to play itself out, knowing that it would block the election process, buy the party time, and increase the frustration necessary to bring in a candidate of its choice, which many observers believe is Army commander Jean Kahwagi. The security threats in recent weeks, while real, have also been played up to make Kahwagi more appealing to the public and to foreign governments that have doubts about him. </p><p> Hezbollah may also want more time to decide because the regional situation has again become unpredictable. With the offensive by the Islamic State in Iraq  and Greater Syria  (ISIS) and the Sunni uprising in Iraq, the party is under greater pressure. Iraqi Shiite militias have returned home to fight ISIS, forcing  Hezbollah to fill the void in Syria. For its part, Iran is scrambling to impose some order on the Iraqi chaos, even as the country fragments between its Shiite, Sunni and Kurdish components. </p><p>In this context,  Hezbollah faces two sets of problems. On the one hand, Lebanese divisions make an early resolution to the presidential deadlock in a way the party favors highly improbable. On the other, with the situation in  Iraq so volatile and  Hezbollah heavily committed in Syria, it’s better for the party to perpetuate a Lebanese vacuum until Iran and  Hezbollah can shift the tide regionally. At that stage,  Hezbollah would seek to impose a new balance in  Lebanon that reflects this reality.</p><p>There are many uncertainties in such a scenario, which is probably why we can expect a further delay in parliamentary elections scheduled for November. With everything stalemated, the prospect of a consensus over a new electoral law seems very remote. Nor is  Hezbollah keen to return to the 1960 law, which may lead to a Parliament similar to the one we have today. This would force the party to be dependent on the centrists, which it doesn’t want.</p><p> Lebanon is set for many more months of much ado about nothing. But before anyone assumes we are entering an uncontrollable vacuum, the reality is that we are in a well-planned holding pattern. Michel Aoun  is the in-flight entertainment while we wait, courtesy of Hezbollah.</p><p>Michael Young is opinion editor of THE DAILY STAR.

This has much wider implications than are immediately visible.</p><p> Kirkuk&#x2019;s status has been a matter of dispute for decades. The late Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein sought to change the ethnic make-up of the province by increasing the Arab population and driving out Kurds and Assyrians. After Hussein&#x2019;s removal in 2003, the status of Kirkuk continued to divide Kurds and the government in Baghdad.</p><p>The deadlock was broken in recent weeks by the offensive of the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), now renamed the Islamic State, and its takeover of the city of Mosul. Iraqi security forces withdrew from Kirkuk as a consequence and Kurdish Peshmerga forces moved in to fill the vacuum.</p><p>With the province having fallen into the Kurds&#x2019; lap, and the central government in disarray, no one believes that Kirkuk will return to Baghdad&#x2019;s authority soon, or ever. Mr Barzani&#x2019;s promise of a referendum will have little reassured those who know the Kurds will seek to win the vote at all costs.</p><p>Yet this is only the first stage in a process likely leading to Kurdish independence. In an interview with the BBC&#x2019;s Jim Muir, Mr Barzani has said that as Iraq is effectively partitioned, it is the Kurds&#x2019; right to achieve independence: &#x201c;Are we supposed to stay in this tragic situation the country&#x2019;s living? It&#x2019;s not me who will decide on independence. It&#x2019;s the people. We&#x2019;ll hold a referendum and it&#x2019;s a matter of months.&#x201d;</p><p>Yet Mr Barzani will have to be careful about regional reactions to the emergence of an independent Kurdistan. Traditionally, Turkey, Iran and Syria have opposed any such outcome, fearful that this would encourage their own Kurdish minorities to pursue greater autonomy or independence. But the regional situation has greatly changed, altering attitudes all around.</p><p>Turkey is the main economic and oil outlet for Iraqi Kurdistan, and over the last decade Kurdish-Turkish relations have substantially improved, making Ankara more amenable toward Kurdish independence. Huseyin Celik, the spokesman for the ruling Justice and Development Party, has told the Financial Times: &#x201c;In the past an independent Kurdish state was a reason for war [for Turkey] but no one has the right to say this now.&#x201d;</p><p>Mr Celik used a logic similar to Mr Barzani&#x2019;s, arguing that Iraq was breaking apart, and if &#x201c;Iraq is divided and it is inevitable, [the Kurds] are our brothers&#x2026;&#x201d; That said, there continue to be disagreements within Turkey over policy toward Turkey&#x2019;s own Kurds, even if prime minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan&#x2019;s government believes that Iraqi Kurdish dependency on Turkey would place a Kurdish state in Turkey&#x2019;s area of influence.</p><p>Iran, in turn, has more reservations about the idea of Kurdish independence. The Islamic Republic has repeated that it supports the unity of Iraq and opposes separation and partition. According to the daily Al Hayat, in a recent meeting between Iranian officials and the prime minister of the Kurdistan region, Nechervan Barzani, the Iranians expressed their &#x201c;worry&#x201d; about recent developments involving Kurdistan.</p><p>As for Syria, there is no effective government there to oppose Kurdish aspirations. Some Kurdish groups are closer to the Kurdish Workers Party of Abdullah Ocalan while others are closer to Massoud Barzani. The closer ties between Turkey and the Iraqi Kurds, like the possibility of a successful peace process between the Erdogan government and Turkey&#x2019;s Kurds, could potentially reduce tensions between Syria&#x2019;s Kurdish factions.</p><p>If that were to happen, Iran could find itself in a situation it would not completely control. The Iranians do not want Turkish influence to grow among Kurds, while the Kurdish faction with which Tehran is closest, Jalal Talabani&#x2019;s Patriotic Union of Kurdistan, has been neutralised somewhat by the fact that Mr Talabani had a stroke in 2012 and has been in Germany since.</p><p>Mr Barzani will doubtless tread carefully before declaring Kurdish independence. But if the Kurds do have their own state, this will serve not only to reinforce the separatist desires of Kurds everywhere, it will be the strongest confirmation yet that the post-First World War borders of the Middle East are collapsing. </p><p>There is a growing realisation, and consensus, that neither Syria nor Iraq is likely to be put back together again. Not only have sectarian and ethnic divisions worsened dramatically in both countries, but there are no competent and conciliatory leaderships in place to reunite either. The ineptitude, brutality and maximalism of the regimes in Iraq and Syria are as much an obstacle to national unity as are their social divisions.</p><p>This has given rise to fears that the countries of the Middle East, particularly those with mixed sectarian or ethnic societies, are heading toward fragmentation. Almost none has a social contract to regulate communal relations, other than Lebanon perhaps, so the region is poorly equipped to resist such momentum.</p><p>The legitimacy of borders is often a function of the legitimacy of states. ISIL&#x2019;s effort to erase the Syrian-Iraqi border may be a temporary phenomenon, but Iraq&#x2019;s Sunnis will not want to fall under a Shia-dominated government in Baghdad again. As for the Kurds, whatever their tactical retreats in establishing a state, they broke psychologically with Iraq long ago.</p><p>We often hear that we are witnessing the end of the Sykes-Picot agreement. In fact we are witnessing the end of the willingness of communities to be part of states incapable of reforming or meeting their citizens&#x2019; aspirations. In the face of irreconcilable differences, divorce becomes more appealing.</p><p>Michael Young is opinion editor of The Daily Star newspaper in Beirut</p><p>On Twitter: @BeirutCalling  </p>";s:17:"post_image_height";i:0;s:16:"post_image_width";i:0;s:11:"post_visits";i:12;s:18:"post_twitterShares";i:28;s:19:"post_facebookShares";i:1;s:16:"post_totalShares";i:29;s:16:"post_socialScore";i:26;s:13:"post_virality";i:27;s:9:"blog_name";N;s:16:"blog_description";N;s:8:"blog_url";N;s:11:"blog_author";N;s:28:"blog_author_twitter_username";N;s:13:"blog_rss_feed";N;s:9:"blog_tags";N;s:2:"id";N;s:11:"blog_active";N;s:24:"blog_last_post_timestamp";N;s:6:"col_id";i:7;s:8:"col_name";s:29:"Michael Young at The National";s:16:"col_media_source";s:12:"The National";s:13:"col_home_page";s:109:"http://www.thenational.ae/apps/pbcs.dll/search?q=*&NavigatorFilter=[Byline:Michael%20Young]&BuildNavigators=1";s:13:"col_shorthand";s:8:"myoungtn";s:26:"col_media_source_shorthand";s:12:"the_national";s:27:"col_author_twitter_username";s:13:"beirutcalling";s:8:"col_tags";s:20:"columnists, politics";s:15:"col_description";s:50:"Michael Young is opinion editor of THE DAILY STAR.";s:23:"col_last_post_timestamp";i:1404314164;}}
