The weakness of the Iraqi army was apparent, as was the  leadership of Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki in its failure to stop the  advance of this Al Qaeda-esque group. <br><br>While the ISIS advance  made news in the Arab world, the world's media lens was focused  elsewhere, on the conflict in neighboring Syria, but it was obvious that  ISIS posed a clear and present danger to Iraq's stability. <br><br>This  was all discussed on the program, but the channel's Shia Muslim  leanings and Iranian backing made it hard to address the malign role of  Maliki and the US backing of Shia groups. The region's media is now just  as sectarian as its politics.<br><br>The world started to take notice recently that the conflict in Iraq did  not end when the US left, and that the Pandora's box the US had opened  when it invaded in 2003 has not been firmly closed. <br><br>Some 1,000  ISIS fighters overran two Iraqi army divisions of 30,000 soldiers in  Mosul, the country's second largest city, and have made further  territorial gains. <br><br>This mess falls squarely in the court of the  US and Britain, which beat the drums for war against the Saddam Hussein  regime, ostensibly over weapons of mass destruction but also touting the  spurious claim that Iraq was connected to Al Qaeda and therefore linked  to the September 11 attacks. <br><br>There was no Al Qaeda or militant  Islamic extremism in Iraq prior to 2003, but the overthrow of Hussein,  the deliberate disintegration of the Iraqi army by the US, the use of  sectarian death squads to further divide and rule, and a new  constitution drafted under US auspices that shifted the sectarian  balance away from the Sunnis, provided the fuel for a fire that is still  burning. <br><br>Under a resurgent Shia government, which has led the  country since 2005, the Sunnis felt marginalized and unrepresented,  resulting in resentment. <br><br>This explains why ISIS has support in  areas it occupies, not overly because people support the group's aims of  an Islamic state, but to counter Shiite dominance and the failure of  imposed federalism. <br><br>The US war on terror has created more  terror, and in the broken and destroyed Iraq that Washington left  behind, has created fertile territory for extremism and violence to  flourish. <br><br>Counter-terrorism can only work if it addresses core grievances and issues, both political and economic. <br><br>But  while the US war on Iraq cost anywhere from $800 billion to $3  trillion, depending on the estimates, just $60 billion was spent on  reconstruction and aid. <br><br>Iraq is struggling to get back on its  feet economically, with the second National Development Plan for 2013-17  requiring $357 billion to improve critical infrastructure.<br><br>ISIS'  advance will scupper such plans, and the Maliki government is under  tremendous pressure. There are only hard choices left. <br><br>Maliki  will have to create alliances with nationalist Sunnis to regain the  north. The Iraqi army did not retake Fallujah earlier in the year, as  tribal leaders convinced Maliki to not destroy the city. <br><br>While  critics opposed this move, it could have further sidelined already  disgruntled Sunnis. They face the same quandary now, if the Iraqi army  brutally retakes Mosul and other ISIS-held areas. <br><br>Only through  addressing core sectarian gripes and through a collaborative military  made up of different sects can Baghdad avoid being seen as overly  pro-Shia and ready to crush the Sunnis. <br><br>If that does not happen,  fuel will be added to the fire of a sectarian war in the Middle East  that is bubbling dangerously close to boiling point. <br><br>";s:17:"post_image_height";i:500;s:16:"post_image_width";i:462;s:11:"post_visits";i:0;s:18:"post_twitterShares";i:0;s:19:"post_facebookShares";i:0;s:16:"post_totalShares";i:0;s:16:"post_socialScore";i:0;s:13:"post_virality";i:0;s:9:"blog_name";s:14:"Back in Beirut";s:16:"blog_description";s:67:"Articles and snapshots: Lebanon, the Middle East and further afield";s:8:"blog_url";s:33:"http://backinbeirut.blogspot.com/";s:11:"blog_author";s:13:"Paul Cochrane";s:28:"blog_author_twitter_username";N;s:13:"blog_rss_feed";s:52:"http://backinbeirut.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default";s:9:"blog_tags";s:14:"tech, business";s:2:"id";i:9;s:11:"blog_active";i:1;s:24:"blog_last_post_timestamp";i:1399376460;}i:1;O:8:"stdClass":26:{s:7:"post_id";i:30590;s:8:"post_url";s:85:"http://backinbeirut.blogspot.com/2014/06/flawed-narratives-cloud-truth-of-syrian.html";s:10:"post_title";s:44:"Flawed narratives cloud truth of Syrian vote";s:10:"post_image";s:87:"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-_3KP3vDbBb0/U5q7BUc3g-I/AAAAAAAABUk/8ZjAva5-LNU/s1600/GT.jpeg";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:123:"Illustration: Liu Rui/GThttp://www.globaltimes.cn/content/865419.shtml By Paul CochraneGlobal Times Published: 2014-6-12...";s:7:"blog_id";s:12:"backinbeirut";s:14:"post_timestamp";i:1402649640;s:12:"post_content";s:5255:"<div></div><div></div><div><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-_3KP3vDbBb0/U5q7BUc3g-I/AAAAAAAABUk/8ZjAva5-LNU/s1600/GT.jpeg" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-_3KP3vDbBb0/U5q7BUc3g-I/AAAAAAAABUk/8ZjAva5-LNU/s1600/GT.jpeg" height="268" width="320"></a></div><br><br><div>Illustration: Liu Rui/GT</div><br>http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/865419.shtml <br>By Paul Cochrane<br>Global Times Published: 2014-6-12<br><br><br>There were huge traffic jams in and around Beirut recently as tens of  thousands of Syrians went to their embassy to vote in the presidential  elections. <br><br>Such a turnout, with the elections extended for an  extra day, confounded many observers, particularly in the anti-Syrian  regime camp. How could people vote for a president, Bashar al-Assad,  during a conflict that has killed over 160,000 people, and a man that  has ruled Syria since 2000, and his father before him since 1971? <br><br>People  must have been intimidated and forced to do so, fearing for their lives  if they did not vote, went some accusations in the press. Others stated  that people were paid to turn up. <br><br>That an estimated 10 million  Syrians voted in Lebanon, Jordan and Syria appeared antithetical to the  anti-Assad narrative in the mainstream media since the uprising started  in 2011; the narrative that Syrians were overwhelmingly against  dictatorship and were fighting for freedom and democracy.<br><br>As is  so often the case, such observation and analysis overlooks the fact that  the price of achieving such goals comes at a high cost for people and  the country. Stability and security are preferable to chaos. <br><br>Indeed,  Syrians had looked on with horror at what happened in Iraq following  the US-led invasion in 2003, and how the country splintered apart amid  brutal sectarian warfare and terrorist attacks. <br><br>Syrians also  looked at neighboring Lebanon, from which Syria withdrew in 2005 after a  29-year military presence, and did not want the Lebanese-style  "democracy" of corrupt political dynasties and sectarian parties either.  <br><br>The Assad government naturally capitalized on such sentiments  and made it part of their narrative of the conflict, that terrorist  insurgents, primarily Sunni extremists, were bent on destroying the  country and were aided externally by the Persian Gulf states of Saudi  Arabia, Qatar and Kuwait, alongside the West. It is a narrative that has  clearly worked, with 88.7 percent of people voting for Assad and a 73.4  percent voter turnout.<br><br>That the election was not overly  transparent, that millions were not able to vote in or outside of the  country - such as in opposition-held areas - and that no members of the  opposition itself were on the ballot naturally raises questions about  its credibility. Yet at the same time, those criticizing the Syrian  elections as a farce were not as quick to say the same about Egypt's  presidential elections that happened at the same time, with Abdel Fattah  al-Sisi getting 96.7 percent of the vote while only 47.5 percent  reportedly voted. <br><br>Indeed, in Egypt, voting was extended for an  extra day not because of overwhelming turnout, but because not enough  people had voted. But Egypt is pro-West and pro-Gulf whereas Syria is  not, so the narrative has to be different.<br><br>Yet this is not to  imply that there is no strong opposition to Assad. There is, whether  from Islamic groups or others, while many Syrians do not feel  represented by the divided opposition itself. <br><br>Syrians did  protest against the "blood elections." A recent poll by the Arab Center  for Research and Policy Studies found that 78 percent of Syrian  respondents inside and outside of refugee camps viewed the presidential  elections as illegitimate, and 64 percent held the opinion that the  ideal solution to the crisis would be through a change in the current  regime.<br><br>So what next, now that Assad is in for a third term as  president? The regime has clearly been given a popularity boost from the  public, and will go on to try to cement that position. Damascus has  political and military support from Iran, and at the international level  from Russia and China.<br><br>Getting to that stage will be the big  challenge. In the meantime, the conflict is set to get even more  polarized. Government forces will try to retake opposition controlled  areas, primarily in the north and east. <br><br>Conversely, there is a  renewed push by the rebels from the southern front in Jordan with the  backing of US, British and Gulf intelligence agencies, and also from the  Turkish border, with the aforementioned agencies along with the Turks  meeting in late May to shift the balance of power in favor of the  rebels. US President Barack Obama has called on Congress for a $5  billion Counterterrorism Partnership Fund "to train, build capacity, and  facilitate partner countries on the front lines," which includes the  Syria conflict.<br><br>The US and Europe have made it clear that Assad  has to go, and have denounced the election. The scene is set for the  three-year-old conflict to rage on, eerily reminiscent of the situation  in Iraq a decade after the overthrow of Saddam Hussein.";s:17:"post_image_height";i:420;s:16:"post_image_width";i:500;s:11:"post_visits";i:0;s:18:"post_twitterShares";i:0;s:19:"post_facebookShares";i:0;s:16:"post_totalShares";i:0;s:16:"post_socialScore";i:0;s:13:"post_virality";i:0;s:9:"blog_name";s:14:"Back in Beirut";s:16:"blog_description";s:67:"Articles and snapshots: Lebanon, the Middle East and further afield";s:8:"blog_url";s:33:"http://backinbeirut.blogspot.com/";s:11:"blog_author";s:13:"Paul Cochrane";s:28:"blog_author_twitter_username";N;s:13:"blog_rss_feed";s:52:"http://backinbeirut.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default";s:9:"blog_tags";s:14:"tech, business";s:2:"id";i:9;s:11:"blog_active";i:1;s:24:"blog_last_post_timestamp";i:1399376460;}i:2;O:8:"stdClass":26:{s:7:"post_id";i:30591;s:8:"post_url";s:82:"http://backinbeirut.blogspot.com/2014/06/lebanons-financial-sector-braces-for.html";s:10:"post_title";s:45:"Lebanon’s financial sector braces for FATCA";s:10:"post_image";s:89:"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-goVHIJJxPQU/U474w3zvDUI/AAAAAAAABTE/RnnzjL8c7hE/s1600/LCB-6.jpg";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:123:"Executive magazine http://www.executive-magazine.com/business-finance/finance/lebanon-financial-sector-braces-for-fatca ...";s:7:"blog_id";s:12:"backinbeirut";s:14:"post_timestamp";i:1401878760;s:12:"post_content";s:10845:"<b>Executive magazine</b><br><b> <a href="http://www.executive-magazine.com/business-finance/finance/lebanon-financial-sector-braces-for-fatca">http://www.executive-magazine.com/business-finance/finance/lebanon-financial-sector-braces-for-fatca</a> </b><br><br><div><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-goVHIJJxPQU/U474w3zvDUI/AAAAAAAABTE/RnnzjL8c7hE/s1600/LCB-6.jpg"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-goVHIJJxPQU/U474w3zvDUI/AAAAAAAABTE/RnnzjL8c7hE/s1600/LCB-6.jpg" height="266" width="400"></a></div><i>The Lebanese Canadian Bank fiasco is fresh on the minds of Lebanese bankers racing to fully comply with FATCA.</i><br><br><br>The countdown is on, with just a month to go before the United States’  Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) goes live on July 1. Aimed at  curbing tax evasion by American citizens, an estimated 26,000 foreign  financial institutions (FFIs) around the world will have to be FATCA  compliant or be shut out of the US financial system. As a result, FFIs —  primarily banks — are scrambling to be ready to report to central banks  or directly to the US’s International Revenue Service (IRS), depending  on governmental agreements.<br><br><div><span>In the MENA region, Lebanon is considered  by local bankers to be ahead of the pack, followed by Jordan, Saudi  Arabia and other Gulf countries. “We’re really well prepared to meet  FATCA, and I think with all modesty, the most prepared in the MENA  today, because we started at the beginning — some three years ago — and  have carried out intensive training,” said <a href="http://www.executive-magazine.com/business-finance/finance/defending-banks-bottom-line" target="_blank">Makram Sader</a>, secretary general of the Association of Banks in Lebanon (ABL). “But very few FFIs will be on time in MENA.”</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>The Lebanese banking sector has been  preparing for FATCA like the teacher’s pet not because it is a major  advocate of reining in tax havens — Lebanese law explicitly allows  companies set up with offshore tax status — or greater taxation  transparency and new tax laws in the country. Rather, the sector is  exceedingly wary of international regulators, specifically of falling  foul of the US Treasury. This is due to Lebanon’s immense exposure to  American leverage: some 70 percent of local deposits are held in US  dollars; banks need to keep good relations with correspondent banks in  the US and elsewhere; and no one wants a repeat of the 2011 <a href="http://www.executive-magazine.com/business-finance/finance/an-arranged-marriage" target="_blank">Lebanese Canadian Bank fiasco</a>, when the bank was accused by the US of money laundering and subsequently closed its doors. </span></div><div><br></div><div><span>“Banks want to avoid the danger of having  another [Lebanese Canadian Bank] right now, as it would affect the  sector as a whole, so all banks are being careful that FATCA will be  properly applied,” said Malek Costa, head of compliance at BLOM Bank.  “In substance, the threat is to be cut off from the US financial  system.”</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>Compliance has become a major concern for  the sector, pushed by the central bank, Banque du Liban (BDL), which  issued two circulars — 126 and 128 — in 2012 and 2013 for banks to abide  by international regulations and establish compliance departments,  respectively. Indeed, compliance with anti-money laundering and  counterterrorism financing regulations — with FATCA the latest such  addition — is being taken so seriously that Sader conceded that he has  spent about 20 percent of his time over the past two years on compliance  issues alone. </span></div><div><br></div><div><span>That said, Sader claimed Lebanon is well  positioned to capitalize on providing financial services related to  FATCA. “Maybe we can prepare other MENA countries to implement FATCA by  exporting that skill. For example, we are supporting the Association of  Iraqi Banks, as there are 11 Lebanese banks there, by educating our bank  partners and supporting the Central Bank of Iraq,” he said.</span></div><div><br></div><div><b>Legal issues</b></div><div><br></div><div><span>However, that the banking sector has  prepared for FATCA so early can be read as a further indication of the  country’s inability to defy US demands. Indeed, as one compliance  officer put it off the record, “It is ridiculous that it takes a  foreigner to come here and say you have to apply regulations, and we do  it, but not because we are afraid of the Lebanese regulator.” </span></div><div><br></div><div>FATCA has been a problematic law to apply globally, with  governments having to amend domestic legislation — in Lebanon’s case to  allow for US clients to waive banking secrecy. Moreover, the act was met  with political resistance and a lackluster uptake by many  jurisdictions, so much so that the IRS had to delay FATCA’s rollout  multiple times. Adding to the law’s problems, none of the rising BRICs  (Brazil, Russia, India or China) have signed up yet. However, there has  been a flurry of jurisdictions signing intergovernmental agreements  (IGAs) with the US just in the past few months as the IRS went on a  global push, fearing that FATCA’s effectiveness could be undermined  before it even started.</div><div><br></div><div><span>Another potential reason for the push was  to end the current period in which Americans can renounce their  citizenship without paying back taxes. “There are around 3,000  renunciations a year of US citizenship and there is growing interest,  but they don’t say if it’s because of FATCA or a travel risk element,  but certainly FATCA has an impact because of the complexity of banking  in this world,” claimed Armand Arton, president and CEO of global  financial advisory business Arton Capital.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span><b>Loss of business?</b></span></div><div><br></div><div><span>BDL opted to not go for an IGA with  Washington but rather for banks to report directly to the IRS, concerned  that if it signed an IGA there would be the remote possibility of the  US freezing BDL money in the event of non-compliance. “It was a  political reason, to not be an agent of the IRS,” said a senior source  at BDL speaking on the condition of anonymity.</span></div><div><br></div><div>Yet while many jurisdictions have not yet signed up to  FATCA, and some are unlikely to at all — Russia is a prime example — and  certain MENA countries lag behind, the Lebanese banks are more than  ready. “We are working as if FATCA already exists,” said Abdul Razzak  Achour, chair and general manager of Fenicia Bank. “We are contacting  all FFIs that we do business with and checking if [they are] FATCA  compliant; if not, we will act accordingly.”</div><div><br></div><div><span>But herein lies the primary problem with  the law. How will FATCA compliant Lebanese banks deal with what the IRS  calls “recalcitrant” FFIs? And does the sector stand to lose business by  not dealing with non-participating FFIs in say West Africa, Algeria or  China? No one interviewed by Executive could give a clear answer.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>“I’m not sure if we’ll lose business.  Even the worst country in Africa has clean businesses and wants to do  business with good banks,” said Sader. “Yet in terms of business,  [Lebanese banks are] in 30 different countries, and maybe five, six or  seven countries will not comply [with FATCA].”</span></div><div><br></div><div><b>Practical short game, long term worries</b></div><div><br></div><div><span>Joseph El Fadl, a managing partner at  Deloitte, which was contracted to draw up a FATCA implementation manual  for the ABL, believes the IRS will initially be pragmatic once FATCA  goes live. “The IRS acknowledges it’s not going to be a piece of cake  and indicates it is not going to be difficult with FFIs in the early  stages,” he said. “We’ve seen that international banks want compliant  FFIs, but what will be the reaction? We may have two layers, big banks  refraining from doing business with non-participating FFIs, and medium  banks applying withholding tax, but we don’t know yet.”</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>Initially, FATCA will be implemented in  two phases. “The first is to screen all existing accounts with a  threshold of over $1 million, so not a big task [in Lebanon] as that’s  not more than 2 to 4 percent of customer deposits. Then it will move to  thresholds of $50,000 and above, and about documentation and questions,  with a short list of who could fall under FATCA,” said El Fadl.</span></div><div>This second stage will prove the most trying, as banks  will have to sift through all bank accounts for possible US indicia —  citizenship, residency, addresses, etc. — with Sader estimating there  could be as many as three million accounts to go through.</div><div><br></div><div><span>Elsewhere in the region this may be more  challenging. For example, Syria is requiring banks to be FATCA  compliant, including Lebanese banks operating in the country. “There’s a  large number of displaced Syrians, so it will be a challenge as a  number of clients are outside the country, and there may be a mismatch  between addresses on record and current addresses because of the  security situation,” said Chahdan Jebeyli, who wears several hats as  chief legal and compliance officer at Bank Audi, chairman of the ABL’s  anti-money laundering committee, and the Union of Arab Banks’ head of  compliance.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>If clients are not cooperative, banks  will have to decide whether to close an account or withhold 30 percent  of interest returns in tax, as stipulated by FATCA. “The main issue  banks will face is confronting pre-existing customers to make them fill  out the necessary documents,” said Costa. “For example, if a client  having US indicia showing in the core banking system or customer file  says, ‘No, I am not a US citizen,’ we’ll say, ‘Prove it within 90 days  or we’ll close the account, or withhold.’”</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>What is expected is that the financial  sector will essentially police itself by dealing with only compliant  FFIs. “You will see banks across the world asking other banks if [they  are] FATCA compliant, asking about the Global Intermediary  Identification Number [GIIN — to be registered with the IRS] and it will  be a main factor in evaluating the continuing relationship,” said  Jebeyli. “I don’t believe any Lebanese bank will not be compliant, and  if there are mistakes, it will be in the details not the general  direction.”</span></div><div><br></div>";s:17:"post_image_height";i:667;s:16:"post_image_width";i:1000;s:11:"post_visits";i:0;s:18:"post_twitterShares";i:0;s:19:"post_facebookShares";i:0;s:16:"post_totalShares";i:0;s:16:"post_socialScore";i:0;s:13:"post_virality";i:0;s:9:"blog_name";s:14:"Back in Beirut";s:16:"blog_description";s:67:"Articles and snapshots: Lebanon, the Middle East and further afield";s:8:"blog_url";s:33:"http://backinbeirut.blogspot.com/";s:11:"blog_author";s:13:"Paul Cochrane";s:28:"blog_author_twitter_username";N;s:13:"blog_rss_feed";s:52:"http://backinbeirut.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default";s:9:"blog_tags";s:14:"tech, business";s:2:"id";i:9;s:11:"blog_active";i:1;s:24:"blog_last_post_timestamp";i:1399376460;}i:3;O:8:"stdClass":26:{s:7:"post_id";i:30584;s:8:"post_url";s:66:"http://blog.chemali.org/2014/06/live-die-repeat-afterthoughts.html";s:10:"post_title";s:30:"Live Die Repeat: Afterthoughts";s:10:"post_image";s:116:"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-uQgV7CYlyK4/U4zwSnw036I/AAAAAAAAHHA/jea2e9OGPRw/s1600/edge_of_tomorrow_ver4_xlg%5B1%5D.jpg";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:123:"Many of you who follow me on social media or read the blog know that I am quite passionate about movies.

I watch a lot of movies, good or bad regardless of style unless it's a beautiful Italian movie that's been ripped off onto an egyptian version. As a techie (see I avoided using geek) sci-fi has always held a special place in my heart and when I got the chance to get a sneak peak at Tom Cruise and Emily Blunt's latest flick I didn't mind throwing a few elbows to make my way into the movie theater.<br><br>I don't want to go throw in any spoilers as most have not seen the movie yet, also since I strongly believe there is a special place in hell (or somewhere in Beirut Traffic, whichever comes first) for people who giveaway plot details. So here are my 2 cents on what I got to watch tonight.<br><br>This was an entertaining movie with some cool visual effects, acceptable plot line (with only one major hiccup), some curved balls that break away partially of the Hollywood stereotypes and the same action movie quality performance we have seen before from either star.<br><br>The hook, however is in the title and the trailer as you might have already seen it. The possibility of living, dying then repeating things has been toyed with for a while. The temporal loop has been explored before in many movies, my favorite being still "<b><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0107048/" target="_blank">Ground Hog Day</a>"</b> (1993) with Bill Murray.<br><br>Although the comedy of Bill Murray does take a jab at analyzing life and exploring the intricate emotions that connect us humans, <b>"Live Die Repeat" </b>takes a darker approach to this from the start by setting the action in the midst of war, where there are far worse odds to come up against than meeting <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqSYC_vwhDg" target="_blank">Ned Ryerson</a>.<br><br>This movie offered a nice trip into a darker future world where hope was scarce but human spirit prevailed but the roller coaster it took me on was not on the silver screen, it was mostly in the afterthoughts of "what if".<br>What if we were given to relive the same experiences and learn to correct mistakes?<br>What if we were not able to learn?<br>What if that was a punishment and not a blessing? I know a few people I would not want to be reliving the same day with and I am sure they feel the same.<br>But then again, if you really think about it, sometimes real life does need an undo button .<span> </span></div>";s:17:"post_image_height";i:1500;s:16:"post_image_width";i:1012;s:11:"post_visits";i:2;s:18:"post_twitterShares";i:0;s:19:"post_facebookShares";i:2;s:16:"post_totalShares";i:2;s:16:"post_socialScore";i:5;s:13:"post_virality";i:6;s:9:"blog_name";s:31:"@Face Value, by Patrick Chemali";s:16:"blog_description";s:109:"If that's how I said it happened, then most probably that's how it happened...well, in my opinion at least...";s:8:"blog_url";s:24:"http://blog.chemali.org/";s:11:"blog_author";s:15:"Patrick Chemali";s:28:"blog_author_twitter_username";s:7:"chemali";s:13:"blog_rss_feed";s:51:"http://blog.chemali.org/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss";s:9:"blog_tags";s:21:"society, tech, design";s:2:"id";i:270;s:11:"blog_active";i:1;s:24:"blog_last_post_timestamp";i:1401745680;}i:4;O:8:"stdClass":26:{s:7:"post_id";i:30564;s:8:"post_url";s:59:"http://tech-ticker.com/user-friendly-phone-headsets-office/";s:10:"post_title";s:52:"The most user friendly phone headsets for the office";s:10:"post_image";s:72:"http://i1.wp.com/tech-ticker.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/headset2.jpg";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:123:"Choosing the right headset for your office can make all the difference in your overall productivity.

It can also make things easier for you staff, resulting in less strain, fatigue and time off work. In simple terms, the more user friendly a headset is, the shorter the training period, and the faster your staff can get back to work. Here are some of the more user friendly headsets you can choose for your office today.</p>
<h3>Wireless headsets</h3>
<p>Without a doubt, wireless headsets are the optimal choice for those businesses and organisations serious about their overall communication systems. Cords just get in the way, and going wireless allows your staff to concentrate more on servicing your clients and getting their work done. Top of the range models such as those offered by <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/~com2.com.au/">Com2</a> include the Sennhieser DW Pro Series, the Jabra PRO 900 Series, and the Savi 720. All these models are completely wireless, comfortable, and have a long enough talk time to see most work days through. Of course, you need to ensure the range of the headset you purchase is suitable for your environment and working conditions. However in this day and age, most headsets offer more wireless range than needed in most office environments. But it doesn’t hurt to check.</p>
<h3>Noise cancelling headsets</h3>
<p>Another important feature in a user friendly headset is the degree of noise cancellation it provides. We all know that offices aren’t necessarily the quietest of environments. With other colleagues on the phone, incoming phone calls, and the constant churning of office printers and fax machines, you need a headset that shields as much outside noise as possible. Noise cancelling headsets block much of the outside noise from entering your earpiece, enabling you to listen more attentively to your clients. Some of the better models on the market today include the HW251N Noise Cancelling Monoaural headset, as well as the TriStar H81N Noise Cancelling Headset.</p>

<h3>Corded headsets</h3>
<p>If going wireless isn’t exactly your thing, or – more likely – you work in an environment with too much interference to allow for a clear signal to run through your office space, then you’ll have to settle for a corded headset. However, there’s no need to feel discouraged. In fact, corded headsets offer a number of advantages that you just can’t find in wireless models, and can end up being the most user friendly choice for your office. For example, corded models don’t run out of battery. If your sales process errs on the longer side, then a headset that won’t run out of battery during an important call can be worth its weight in gold. Both the Jabra BIZTM 1900 Series and the Jabra GN2000 Series of corded headsets are not only comfortable and made to last, but feature state of the art noise cancellation technology. How good is that?</p>

<p>Choosing the most user friendly headset for your offers depends on a number of factors: mainly your physical environment and your work culture. Luckily there are a number of high-quality headsets on the market today that can suit just about any office or application. So take your time, read the reviews and talk to other offices to find out which ones work the best. No doubt you’ll have chosen the best headset for your office in no time at all.</p>

<p>When I first set out to build <em>Lebanese Blogs</em>, my idea was to create a new space to read blogs without the stress of another inbox in our lives (all those unread items in google reader drove me nuts). <em>Lebanese Blogs</em>, in my mind, is much more than an RSS reader. It is a space for discovering, organizing and learning about our community.</p>
<p>That said however, I realize that some habits die hard and that not everybody has the same needs. Some people really do enjoy plowing through their feed reader every evening (heck I still do that myself for international tech and media blogs). Moreover, my ultimate objective is for our bloggers to have the widest readership possible. This is why I decided to publish RSS feeds, and make them awesome at that.</p>
<h3>The best RSS feeds on Lebanon’s internet</h3>
<p><em>Lebanese Blogs</em> now publishes a <a href="http://lebaneseblogs.com/feed">general RSS feed</a> which includes all the blog posts. But that is overkill for most of you (people who like fashion often don’t want to read about politics and vice versa), so I also published category feeds (<a href="http://lebaneseblogs.com/feed/food">food</a>, <a href="http://lebaneseblogs.com/feed/fashion">fashion</a>, <a href="http://lebaneseblogs.com/feed/politics">politics</a>, <a href="http://lebaneseblogs.com/feed/design">design</a>, <a href="http://lebaneseblogs.com/feed/columnists">columnists</a>, <a href="http://lebaneseblogs.com/feed/tech">tech</a>, <a href="http://lebaneseblogs.com/feed/society">society</a>, <a href="http://lebaneseblogs.com/feed/media">media</a>) which allow you to cherry pick what you’re interested in (be mindful though that some bloggers exist in several categories, so you might experience some duplicate items if you’re subscribed to more than one category feed).</p>
<p>Also, unlike other aggregation feeds, ours offer blogger-specific details. For example, each post suggests that you follow its author on Twitter and tries to encourage you to read the post on the blog itself.</p>
<h3>A note to bloggers and authors</h3>
<p>The articles on the feed only include your post’s image and a tiny excerpt. If readers are interested in the post, they’ll have to read it on your own site. I don’t want this feed to be an alternative to your blog.</p>
<p>I hope you really enjoy this feature and, as always, if you have further questions don’t hesitate to <a href="http://twitter.com/beirutspring">drop me a tweet</a>..<br>

<div>Summary extracted from transcript:</div>
<div></div>
<blockquote>
<div><strong><strong>There’s enough water frozen in the ice sheet that feeds these icy giants to raise global sea levels by 4 feet if they were to melt. That’s troubling because the glaciers are melting.<br></strong></strong><br>
Moreover, a new study finds that their decline appears to be irreversible.</div>
<div>Rignot and colleagues have used 19 years of satelliteradardata to map the fast-melting glaciers.In their paper … theyconclude that ‘this sector of West Antarctica is undergoing a marine ice sheet instability that willsignificantly contribute to sea level rise’ in the centuries ahead.A key concept in the Rignot study is the ‘grounding line’ the dividing line between land and water underneath a glacier.
<p>Because virtually all melting occurs where the glaciers’ undersides touch the ocean, pinpointing the grounding line is crucial for estimating melt rates.</p>
<div><strong>In all the glaciers they studied, grounding lines were rapidly retreating away from the sea.</strong></div>
<div><strong>‘In this sector, we are seeing retreat rates that we don’t see anywhere else on Earth,’</strong>Rignot says.Smith Glacier’s line moved the fastest, retreating 22 miles upstream. The other lines retreated from 6 to 19 miles. As the glaciers melt and lose weight, they float off the land where they used to sit.<strong>Water gets underneath the glacier and pushes the grounding line inland. This, in turn, reduces friction between the glacier and its bed. The glacier speeds up, stretches out and thins, which drives the grounding line to retreat farther inland. This is a positive feedback loop that leads to out of control melting.</strong>
<p>‘At current melt rates,’ concludes Rignot, ‘these glaciers will be ‘history’ within a few hundred years.’</p>

Including <em><span>OS X Sequoia, OS X Mojave, OS X Sonoma, and OS X Ventura<span> </span></span></em><span><span>each of which is a well-known city or geographic feature in California. So maybe that explains the banner spotted being set up for the conference.</span></span></p>

<h2>IOS 8</h2>
<p>Witch is not a surprise since every year Apple announces a new version of the mobile OS in the WWDC keynote. As usual updates will be made to the ever struggling maps app, of course the introduction of the<em> Healthbook</em> app a seeing that the Iphone 5s was fitted with a M7 motion co-processor that we have yet seen a good use for. Plus the inevitable integration of beats music service so maybe iTunes won’t suck anymore!</p>

<h2>Apple’s take on home automation</h2>
<p>What started off as something some what exiting turned out to be just boring old certifications that will be handed out by apple to device manufactures… Witch is somewhat identical to the “works with iphone” badge you can see on products that are sold on the apple site under Connected Home.</p>

<p><span>This one is a leak and it can be true as much as it can be false!  </span></p>
<h2>The Iphone 6</h2>
<p>We all know it’s coming we have seen the <a href="http://www.taknologia.com/apple-iphone-6-dummy-revealed/">leaked images</a> but according to <a href="http://www.nowhereelse.fr/iphone-6-video-wwdc-2014-98039/">nowwhererelase.fr</a> witch are in possession of a video that shows a slide that will allegedly be used for the presentation of the unveiling of the Iphone 6. The phone on the screen has that curved philosophy just like in the leaks, so how knows maybe it’s true!  Here is the video judge for yourself:</p>

<h3>iOS 8</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.absolutegeeks.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/phphnvfzp.png" rel="lightbox-0"><img src="http://www.absolutegeeks.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/phphnvfzp.png" alt="" width="728" height="275"></a></p>
<p>Apple always announces new features coming to iOS in WWDC keynote, and we suspect this year will be no different. the keynote is expected to focus around the new Healthbook, Improved maps, Mobile payment, iBeacon,  notification center tweaks and iTunes music (Beats). There is also talk of improvements to Siri and better iCloud support.</p>
<h3>OS X 10.10</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.absolutegeeks.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/os-x-banner-wwdc14-940x198.jpg" rel="lightbox-1"><img src="http://www.absolutegeeks.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/os-x-banner-wwdc14-940x198.jpg" alt="" width="940" height="198"></a></p>
<p>Apple has confirmed that it will show the latest version of OS X at WWDC as well. Not much is known what 10.10 will bring, but general expectations hint to a closer integration with iOS.  The next OS could be called OS X Yosemite.</p>
<h3>Home Automation</h3>
<p>Rumour has it that Apple is diving into the home automation games and will announce something big during WWDC14, nothing confirmed at this stage. We’ll find out soon i guess!</p>
<p>Few other updates could happen during the conference might include a new Apple TV and most probably an updated Mac mini.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.absolutegeeks.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/DSCF8345_verge_super_wide.jpg" rel="lightbox-2"><img src="http://www.absolutegeeks.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/DSCF8345_verge_super_wide.jpg" alt="DSCF8345_verge_super_wide" width="1020" height="680"></a></p>
<p>WWDC is a developer conference focused usually on software and while is does usually announces hardware updates, it is highly unlikely to see new iPhone, iPads or even iWatch at this event. The trend usually points to another Apple event later this year to announce its new devices.</p>

<p>This week, as part of a new initiative to promote civic engagement in Lebanon, developers from Lamba Labs and the SMEX team are launching a new tool called <a href="http://openleb.io/names.html">Nouwweb</a> that allows people to easily access essential public information about the members of parliament who represent them. The tool aims to encourage more frequent and open exchange between MPs and the people they represent. For the moment, the Nouwweb tool is accessible only in English but will be available in Arabic soon.</p>
<p><strong><a title="Nouwweb: Search for your MP" href="http://openleb.io/names.html" target="_blank">Try the Nouwweb tool now.</a></strong></p>
<p>Nouwweb organizes basic information—collected from <a title="Nouwweb: Publicly available data sources" href="https://docs.google.com/a/smex.org/document/d/1ufbbCb5k-39hIZ-AboMafcdvYZQ_c1TZkwIJ6LB9v7c/edit" target="_blank">publicly available sources</a>—for each of the 128 deputies, including district, sect, party, official phone and mobile numbers (if available), and social media accounts for those representatives who are active on email, Facebook, and/or Twitter (not as many as we’d hoped). A simple interface lets anyone search for this information by name, sect, party, district, or social media presence.</p>
<p>Alternatively, web developers can build on the data via <a title="Nouwweb on github" href="https://github.com/openleb/nouwweb" target="_blank">an open API</a> (API stands for <a title="Wikipedia entry for API" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface" target="_blank">application programming interface</a>) to create visualizations (like <a title="Visualizing the U.S. Senate" href="http://sunlightfoundation.com/blog/2013/10/22/how-to-know-the-senate/" target="_blank">this one from the Sunlight Foundation of the U.S. Senate</a>) and other tools that can facilitate citizens’ understanding of and participation in the Lebanese political process. The launch of Nouwweb also coincides with the launch of both <a title="Open Leb:Portal for Open Data Projects in Lebanon" href="http://openleb.io/" target="_blank">OpenLeb</a>, a portal where developers can present their open data projects. Soon, we’ll follow up with a series of open data challenges designed to engage a diverse community of people around the benefits of open data, especially open government data.</p>

<p>Already, there’s an increasing focus on the value of open data for both business and governance in Lebanon. Just last week, the <a title="Internet Society Lebanon Chapter" href="http://www.isoc.org.lb/" target="_blank">Lebanon chapter</a> of the Internet Society held an <a title="Open Data Workshop Facebook Event" href="https://www.facebook.com/events/520586294730979/" target="_blank">open data workshop</a> at École Supérieure des Affaires in Clemenceau, where Greek open data researcher Michalis Vafopoulos demonstrated how open data can be an economic engine and how, in his experience, the financial sector is the best place to start.</p>
<p>Following <a title="Opendefinition.org" href="http://opendefinition.org/" target="_blank">opendefinition.org</a>, data is considered “open if anyone is free to use, reuse, and redistribute it—subject only, at most, to the requirement to attribute and/or share-alike.” For the past several years, international organizations such as the <a title="World Bank Data" href="http://data.worldbank.org/" target="_blank">World Bank</a> and the <a title="UN Data" href="http://data.un.org/" target="_blank">UN</a> as well as a wide range of governments have been releasing once-private datasets into the public domain to drive innovations in business, public oversight of government spending, and other forms of civic engagement. A 12-minute video produced by the UK-based <a title="Open Knowledge Foundation" href="https://okfn.org/" target="_blank">Open Knowledge Foundation</a> explains the potential of open data and gives some examples of how it’s being used.</p>

<p>To get involved in OpenLeb, please join the new <a title="OpenLeb Google Group" href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/openleb" target="_blank">OpenLeb Google Group</a>, where open data advocates in Lebanon can share their work, discuss different approaches to open data, and work together to build open data tools. Subscribing to the group will also keep you up-to-date on future open data events.</p>";s:17:"post_image_height";i:205;s:16:"post_image_width";i:600;s:11:"post_visits";i:7;s:18:"post_twitterShares";i:16;s:19:"post_facebookShares";i:0;s:16:"post_totalShares";i:16;s:16:"post_socialScore";i:18;s:13:"post_virality";i:22;s:9:"blog_name";s:4:"SMEX";s:16:"blog_description";s:19:"Channeling Advocacy";s:8:"blog_url";s:15:"http://smex.org";s:11:"blog_author";s:7:"Various";s:28:"blog_author_twitter_username";s:4:"SMEX";s:13:"blog_rss_feed";s:25:"http://www.smex.org/feed/";s:9:"blog_tags";s:15:"activisim, tech";s:2:"id";i:129;s:11:"blog_active";i:1;s:24:"blog_last_post_timestamp";i:1401511740;}i:15;O:8:"stdClass":26:{s:7:"post_id";i:30401;s:8:"post_url";s:50:"http://tech-ticker.com/short-history-domain-names/";s:10:"post_title";s:31:"A Short History of Domain Names";s:10:"post_image";s:0:"";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:123:"The second half of the nineties was a very exciting time for me, I had just begone learning the ins and outs of the worl...";s:7:"blog_id";s:11:"tech-ticker";s:14:"post_timestamp";i:1401402840;s:12:"post_content";s:8357:"<p><span>The second half of the nineties was a very exciting time for me, I had just begone learning the ins and outs of the world wide web.

<br><span>As is the case nowadays, one of the most exciting moments of building a website is the go-live date. Publishing the site on a production server where the whole WWW would be able to access it and admire the various, soon to be antiquated, techniques that one has put so much effort into implementing.</span></p>
<p><span>However, although many sites offer a shared platform for hosting such as the previously mentioned, now-defunct </span><a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/~en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoCities" target="_blank">Geocities </a><span>or today’s more trendy less techie </span><a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/~wordpress.com/">WordPress.com</a><span>, these sites do not allow you to fully customize your web address or domain name or URL unless you own a domain name.</span>
<br><span>That bit of text that you enter into the browser to load your site (ex: </span><a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/~www.chemali.org/">www.chemali.org</a><span> or </span><a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/~www.sharplemon.com/">www.sharplemon.com</a><span>) is key to many hidden gems.</span></p>
<p><span>The shorter the domain name, the more easily recognisable and the more memorable it is, the more value it holds. Naturally, as businesses became aware of this value, the gold rush towards domain names (especially the .com ones) quickly eradicated the highly coveted 2-letter domain names (ex: </span><a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/~www.hp.com/">www.hp.com</a><span>) followed by the 3-letter ones (ex: </span><a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/~www.cnn.com/">www.cnn.com</a><span>) onto the 4-letter domains which were the ones that lasted the most (until December 2013) until all variations were exhausted.</span>
<br><br><span>The web was growing exponentially and with it the need and awareness for uniquely identifiable domain names. Branding companies reached out to us for advice on booking their unique brand names and on defending those domain names against squatters.</span>
<br><span>Squatting became a common practice that consisted of people buying up interesting names, and holding them “for ransom”, until the persons who have real interest in them paid often ridiculously high amounts of money.</span>
<br><br><span>Copyright laws were amended, and the governing body in charge of domain names, the ICAAN, set up rules for brands to claim their domains, but this offered only minor deterrence, as not everybody had the clout or the desire to litigate. Many often resorted to paying the money in order to speed up the process. I witnessed this first hand, as an ex colleague of mine, received $1000 USD for a domain he bought for a measly $10 USD.</span></p>
<p><span>During the past three years as I ran </span><a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/~sharplemon.com/" target="_blank">Sharp Lemon</a><span>, a great part of our work involved advising and finding suitable domain names for direct clients of ours, or for branding agencies that reached out and required our assistance. The task is a tedious one, as clients are often hooked on the dot com, and refuse to consider other variations.</span>

Furthermore the wow factor is not there when you are using a </span><b>.com.lb</b><span> vs a</span><b>.com </b><span>and the jury is unanimous on that.</span>
<br><br><span>A few practices that I personally dislike that are being used now to comply with client requirements include:</span></p>
<ul><li>Adding a <b>-lb.com:</b> ex: <b>mycooldomain-lb.com</b> <i>(because it’s classier than mycooldomain.com.lb).</i></li>
<li>Splitting the name with dashes: <b>my-cool-domain.com</b> <i>(everybody loves shift key combinations when typing).</i></li>
<li>Going all <b>Web 2.0:</b> instead of <i><b>sharplemon.com</b></i> why not <b><i>shrplmn.com</i> </b><i>(who needs vowels anyway).</i></li>

</ul><div>As many have realized that the .info, .biz and the various tiny variations that have been used were not a sustainable replacement, a shift in paradigm took place which led to the introduction of the New gTLDS (Generic Top Level Domains).

<li>The new extensions can be focused on a city (<i>ex: .nyc)</i> on an industry <i>(ex:.autos) </i>and a plethora of other categories</li>
