<p>As someone who’s been blogging <a href="http://beirutspring.com/">for a while</a> and who runs a <a href="http://lebaneseblogs.com/">blog aggregation website</a>, I get asked often about how to get more readers to read a new blog. I figured I’ll respond in a blog post so that I can point to it whenever someone emails me that question.</p>
<p>Here’s an email I got this morning:</p>
<blockquote><p>Hello Mustapha, hope all is well! I’ve been following your blog for a while (among others) and have recently decided to start my own. I was wondering if you could just give me some advice with regards to how you got your blog to take off, get some decent traffic etc. It seems like an overwhelmingly difficult task to get readers.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Below is my reply:</strong></p>
<p>Hello (name), thanks for getting in touch. I understand your frustration and rest assured that this is a very common issue.</p>
<p>My experience is that nothing can substitute for time and dedication. You learn at the beginning that people are just not lining up to read your new blog. A majority of would-be bloggers give up soon after that. Those who persist learn to live with the idea that you are mostly writing for yourself in the beginning. There are many little tricks to convince yourself that this is a worthwhile effort: Writing is a form of organizing your thoughts. Writing is cathartic and therapeutic exercise. You need <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-26384712">10,000 hours</a> of writing to become an expert..etc, and I can tell you that these techniques help in moments of self-doubt.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, you should be doing your best to spread the word. Share your posts on social media, tell friends and family about your blog. Email other bloggers and introduce them to your blog. submit your blog to aggregators like <em><a href="http://lebaneseblogs.com/">Lebanese Blogs</a></em> (which requires a track record of at least 6 months of blogging) And with time, you’ll pick up readers who identify with your style and ideas. If you’re good, people will start sharing your posts, and if you’re really lucky, a big shot blogger will like what you wrote and link to it and boost your readership..</p>
<p>If I have to give you one single tip, it would be this: Blog about something you’re passionate about, and not about something you think others want to read. The only thing that will sustain you through lack of readers and writers block is a passion for a subject and the enjoyment you get from writing about it as an end in itself. </p>

<p>Unlike earbuds which have a wire between them, the Earin use two separate Bluetooth buds with batteries in each and has a battery life of three hours of listening. Earin also offers a small tube that houses the earbuds and can charge them, while in your pocket.</p>

<p>The update promises to fix many widespread issues with <span>MMS, Wi-Fi, Exchange, and the camera among other things. It also changed the dialer (I admit I liked the previous one) and the contacts manager (which still needs too many taps to edit a contact). But the update has been reportedly detrimental to some Nexus 4 and Nexus 5 users, with many complaining about Wi-Fi connectivity, random reboots, broken notifications, battery problems, 3G issues, <a title="Android 4.4.3 KitKat Problems Plague Nexus Users" href="http://www.gottabemobile.com/2014/06/10/android-4-4-3-kitkat-problems/" target="_blank">and the list goes on</a>.</span></p>

<p>A leaked document from the Iraqi telecom ministry shows that the government has decided that the best solution to fight false and embarrassing online news is by doing what Mubarak did three and half years ago in Egypt, kill the Internet.</p>
<p>In addition to being a violation of Iraqis’ rights, the action is seen as a rejection of efforts by Iraqi bloggers of the country-wide <a href="https://www.facebook.com/IN4SM">Iraqi Network for Social Media</a> to fight false news not with censorship but with more accurate news. Search for the hashtag <a href="https://twitter.com/search?f=realtime&q=%23insm_iq&src=tyah">#INSM_iq</a> as well as this <a href="https://twitter.com/MoNajem/iraqi-reliable-tweeps/members">list of trusted Twitter users</a> from inside the country to follow developments.</p>
<p>The two-page document from the Ministry of Telecommunications in Iraq is dated June 15, under #5214. Below is an unofficial translation:</p>
<p>To all Internet Service Providers (Oufok Al Samaa, IQ Network, Earth Network, Earthlink, AlSared, NouroZtel, FastIraq, ITC, HalaSat, AlJazeera):</p>
<p>Following the current security incidents and the exceptional situation that Iraq is having, and instructed by the Chancellery of the National Security, it is decided the below:</p>
<p>1- Shut down the Internet totally on these Provinces: Ninawa, Anbar, Saleh El Din, Kirkuk, Diyalah.</p>
<p>2- Block all access to VPN in all Iraq from 4 pm until 7 am on daily basis</p>
<p>3- Block all access to these websites in all Iraq: Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, Viber, Skype. In addition to other applications: Tango, Wechat, Instagram, didi</p>
<p>4- Block all access to Internet from all these areas: AlAdel, AlGhazlieh, Abu Greib, AlRadwanieh, AlMahmoudieh, AlLuteifiah, Falouja, Jarf Sakher, Al Taji, Al Youssfieh, Al Missyeb)</p>
<p>There will be a special security committee specialized to to check that you are following these instructions. The companies that won’t obey will be threatening the security of the country.</p>
<p>Saleh Hassan Ali</p>
<p>Acting General Manager</p>
<p>Few Iraqi activists (who prefer to remain anonymous) attributes the action to the fact that Maliki failed to get majority in the Parliament to announce state of emergency in Iraq, and in this case his government and the Ministry of Telecommunication is illegally ordering ISPs to cut the Internet following the Iraqi laws. Companies have the right to decline their request, but unfortunately they won’t, he says, because keeping their business is their priority and not their users’ rights.</p>

<p>With the rise in Instagram’s popularity and after it was acquired by Facebook a question lingered on on whether deeper integration was going to happen. This question is still hanging although we saw several areas where the knowledge exchange took place. Brand, however, were still obliged to jump through several hoops inside the Instagram app to connect and share to the brand with no equivalent to the Twitter connect page.</p>
<p><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/Iiq43A0v6-s?wmode=transparent&theme=light&modestbranding=1&showinfo=0&autohide=1&rel=0&color=white" width="970" height="546" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>A few days ago, while accessing one of the page that we manage, I was surprised by a prompt that appeared on top of the page inviting me to click to link the client’s Instagram to the Business Page.</p>
<p>I followed the link and landed on this page:</p>
<p><img src="http://i0.wp.com/tech-ticker.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Facebook-Instagram-Connect.jpg?resize=816%2C796" alt="Facebook" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<p>The page is accessible via the following <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/~https://www.facebook.com/pages/instagram/" target="_blank">link</a>.</p>
<p>At the very bottom was the client’s page name listed next to the “Connect to Instagram” button but I have chosen to obscure that name for the time being.</p>
<p>Interestingly enough the link is not generally accessible and other pages could not be connected to Instagram using this technique. When asking a friend who shares no common pages with me to try the link out he obtained the standard Facebook 404 page not found.</p>
<p>My best guess is that Facebook is rolling out this feature as part of an A/B test or for select high profile pages. I should mention that this specific client has well over one million fans with a very high engagement rate.</p>
<p>We have reached out asking some more info from a Facebook representative, no answer has been received yet.</p>
<p>Have you also encountered this? Did you connect your Instagram? Let me know in the comments.</p>

<p>FailCon Dubai is one of the series of FailCon events that happen in many cities across the world. The event attracts entrepreneurs, technologists, investors and corporates to learn about the stumbles and failures one comes across during the course of their venture or career and the ways to avoid or overcome them. FailCon sends a message that failure is not a bad thing and encourages the speakers to share their experience with others. Some of the speakers sharing their stories in the Dubai edition include Amir Yazdanpanah- COO of VoiceTrust, Ambareen Musa – Founder of Souqalmal, Omar Soudodi- MD of PayFort, Dany El Eid- Founder of Pixelbug and Ahmed Al Kiremli of Games Corner.</p>
<p>“I don’t mind failing, but if we succeed, it’d better be worth succeeding.” said Vinod Khosla, the venture capitalist and businessman in one of the FailCon events, expressing his love to talk about his failures. And he went on to add – “Look for people who critique you. Examine failure modes. Collect all the ways you might fail and build contingency plans.”</p>
<p>With many corporate bodies along with the support of the government, Dubai is emerging as one of the hot beds of entrepreneurship in the MENA region and FailCon Dubai will be an ideal conference where the budding entrepreneurs can learn about things they will come across in their journey and ways to overcome these challenges from those who have experienced firsthand. FailCon Dubai also gives an opportunity for startups in this region to demo their product at the event. Startups can apply for the demo on the <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/~dubai.thefailcon.com/2014/demos.html" target="_blank">FailCon Dubai Website</a>.</p>
<p>FailCon was started in 2009 by Cass Phillipps, an event planner for startup events and Diane Loviglio, a founder of a cleantech startup. The Dubai event is being produced by Gautham N and Mahboob Imtiyaz who are co-founders of KarmaSnap, A startup based in this region.</p>
<p>Through Failcon, Cass and her co-organizers hope to change the global opinion of failure. Founders and investors alike tend to shy away from discussions on failure. But the lifestyle of an entrepreneur is wrought with small failures and mistakes. FailCon gives people a platform to share these lessons learned in a safe and productive environment.</p>

People can now get acquainted with professionals in their fields, get exposure for their work, get funding for their start-ups, find jobs and even meet new people with similar interests or hobbies. In Lebanon, there is a thriving community of well-educated and interesting members who are worth connecting with on a professional or personal basis. However, he believes only a portion of the Lebanese are aware and knowledgeable enough about proper ways of using social media to enhance their lives.</span></span> </blockquote><blockquote><span>Hijazi runs the Online Collaborative, an NGO that aims to promote awareness about technology and social media, and is the organizing entity of the Beirut Social Media Awards set to launch in several GCC countries this year. In addition, he is the Editor in Chief of Cloud961, a print and online magazine dedicated to the online community that addresses digital and social media topics from the MENA region. Connect with him on LinkedIn and talk to him on his Twitter handle @<a href="http://www%2Ctwitter.com/mhijazi" target="_blank">mhijazi</a></span></blockquote><div><strong>1) Why should the Lebanese care about social media? In what way is it helpful? Are most Lebanese aware or knowledgeable enough about social media?</strong><br>Social media is no longer just a tool to communicate or connect with people that we know. Its opportunities have become much wider than that. People can now get acquainted to professionals in their fields, get exposure for their work, get funding for their start-ups, find jobs and even meet new people with similar interests or hobbies. In Lebanon, there is a thriving community of well-educated and interesting members who are worth connecting with on professional or personal basis. However, I believe only the elite of the Lebanese are aware and knowledgeable enough about proper ways of using social media to enhance their lives. I am not saying that only the elite are on social media; on the contrary, the majority are. But they do not know how to use it or are not interested in using it beyond chatting and sharing photos.<br><br><strong>2) What do people need to know about social media in Lebanon? Are there courses to take? Who is offering them? What do they teach?</strong><br>Social media is constantly changing day to day. Every week, a new social network is born and people need to keep up. Social media courses are popping up everywhere. Everyone who wants to make a quick buck now offers a social media course, but most of these are not useful as the trainers are not experienced and only offer basics that can be self-acquired. People need to do their research about the trainer and his work in social media before enrolling in classes and spending their money.<br><br>For senior citizens (above 50 years of age) who are interested in learning about social media, I recommend Social Media for Beginners which is given at AUB (and open for everyone above 50) as part of the University for Seniors. They offer courses such as social media, iPads and smartphones for the older generation who would like to become tech-literate.<br><br><strong>3) How are businesses and companies benefiting from social media? what are the tools they are using for marketing? what works in Lebanon and what doesn't? Can you provide examples of companies and how they use social media?</strong><br>Businesses are perhaps the most who benefit from social media as they are using it to market their products and services. As compared to traditional advertising, social media advertising costs 5-10% as much but yields more than a 1000% result and most businesses are starting to realize this and shifting their advertising to online marketing.<br><br>The most effective social media for business in Lebanon right now is Facebook, with Instagram picking up at second place and Twitter in third. Facebook advertising is the key to get exposure for any product or service that is catered to the masses, while Linkedin works more for professionals or B2B advertising. Once Instagram advertising is launched in the Middle East, I believe it might surpass advertising budgets for Facebook since Instagram is now more appealing that other social networks due to its visual interface.<br><br>Many companies in Lebanon have tried using Twitter for marketing, but very few succeeded. It is currently being used as a customer service and crisis management medium rather than advertising purposes. Many jumped on the Pinterest bandwagon but this platform proved to have so little interest from the general public (as it has become a niche social network for women, fashion and food) that many brands have abandoned it.<br><br>As for examples, I wouldn't want to give free advertising to businesses but I would like to point out an NGO that is doing a great job on social media. Donner Sang Compter (DSC) is an NGO that relies on social media to connect blood donors to blood banks, hospitals or even people in desperate need for blood. Most of their communication is done of Facebook, Twitter and Instagram and this has been extremely effective for them.<br><br><strong>4) Politicians and entertainers also use social media. How does it benefit them? Who are the most popular ones in Lebanon? Can you name the top 10 most famous social media personalities?</strong><br>Social media has changed the way politicians and entertainers communicate with their audience/fans. Before, traditional media only allowed a one-way communication where the celebrity would say what he/she wants with little or no feedback from the audience. Social media has changed this into a two-way communication where these celebrities engage directly (with no middle-man) with their audience. This gives the celebrity a human feel and gets them closer to their audience.<br><br>It is hard to say who are the most popular figures online because each source have different criteria of measurement. I will be relying on SocialBakers.com for the latest Facebook figures of LOCAL FANS for several categories.<br></div><div><strong>For brands:</strong></div><ol><li>Sayfco </li><li>Master Chips</li><li>Samsung Lebanon</li><li>Samsung Mobile Levant</li><li>Trident</li><li>Trident</li><li>Touch Lebanon</li><li>Oreo</li><li>Samsung Levant</li><li>Nescafe</li></ol><div><strong>Media pages:</strong></div><ol><li>MTV Lebanon</li><li>LBCI</li><li>Aljadeed Online</li><li>Virgin Radio Lebanon</li><li>Al Jaras Magazine</li><li>Tayyar.org</li><li>Lebanon 24</li><li>OTV</li><li>Al Mayadeen TV</li><li>Mix FM Lebanon</li></ol><div><strong>Celebrities:</strong></div><ol><li>Cyrine Abdelnour</li><li>Nancy Ajram</li><li>George Khabbaz</li><li>Najwa Karam</li><li>Elissa</li><li>Haifa Wehbe </li><li>Wael Jassar</li><li>George Wassouf</li><li>Tamer Hosny</li><li>Myriam Fares</li></ol><div><strong>Society pages:</strong></div><ol><li>Sleiman Frangieh</li><li>President Michel Sleiman</li><li>Lebanese Forces</li><li>Saad Hariri</li><li>Ammar Al Hakim</li><li>KidzMondo</li><li>Michel Aoun (unofficial page)</li><li>Global Study UK</li><li>Donner Sang Compter</li><li>Ziyad Baroud<span data-mce-style="overflow:hidden;line-height:0px" data-mce-type="bookmark">﻿<span data-mce-style="overflow:hidden;line-height:0px" data-mce-type="bookmark">﻿</span></span></li></ol><div>As I mentioned though, these ranking do not necessary mean that these pages are more active or have a better social media presence, but rather a bigger number of local fans on Facebook.<br><br><strong>5) As a social media consultant, you've created the Online Collaborative. What purpose does it have? Can you provide background on how the idea came about?</strong><br>My primary day jobs include being a social media consultant for brands and companies and Editor in Chief of a print and online magazine about social media and tech called Cloud 961. However, this does not relate to the Online Collaborative. It is a non-profit zero-salary initiative that aims to promote the proper usage of social media to the Lebanese public (students, children and senior citizens) through workshops, events and conferences. We also aim to be a platform for bloggers and members of the online community to unite and discuss their problems (such as online bullying and lawsuits from brands).<br><br>In 2010, we founded the Online Collaborative when we saw that there is no entity that groups social media enthusiasts and experienced individuals in the digital media world. It aimed to help promote proper digital citizenship through making the most of social media in the best ways possible. Spanning over 120 members, OC has already organized many successful events and training workshops in Lebanon such as the Social Media Changing Lives conference at AUB in 2011 and 2014, and Blogging Lebanon Conference in 2010. It also actively seeks to provide support to various local and regional events in providing online coverage and community crowd-sourcing.<br><br><strong>6) You've also held the Social Media Awards and several conferences attended by many to explain the importance of connecting. What have been the highlights of these events? What can the audience take away?</strong><br>The Social Media Awards is also a non-profit initiative by the Online Collaborative that aims to allows the Lebanese online community to nominate, vote for and award their favorite accounts in the Lebanese social media scene in an attempt to shine a spotlight on the bloggers, journalists, content creators, community managers, public personas, users of social media and celebrities that are doing a great job on social media in hopes that they become role models for others in the community. The audience of the SMAs and other conferences were able to identify the best practices of social media usage and ways they can improve their lives using online media.<br><br><strong>7) When readers from abroad read this article, what will they find out about social media in Lebanon that they did not know? How can they connect with the Lebanese? Are the Lebanese abroad and the ones here connecting a lot?</strong><br>I'm not sure if readers realize that Lebanon has a thriving and very active online community that have become trend-setters for the Lebanese and Middle East. Many of the members are constantly approached by brands for their opinions on products and services for example.<br><br>Additionally, individuals and brands get criticized and bashed all the time. It is easier to criticize because most people don’t realize that at the other side of the screen, there is a living breathing human being that will be affected by their words. If it were an offline conversation, most people will tend to consider the consequences of their words more and try to be diplomatic in order not to hurt the individual they are criticizing. Possibly the most negative aspect of social media is that it eliminates the human aspect from communication and that’s what the online community needs to be aware of.<br><br>As for the expats, I have noticed that a lot of them like to engage with the residents because it brings them closer to their motherland and keeps them connected and aware about what is going on in Lebanon. A premium example about this is perhaps the most active Lebanese political blog (Beirut Spring) is run by a Lebanese expat (Mustapha Hamaoui) who have lived in Ghana for years!</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MindSoup/~4/7Sd3zGxeUTE" height="1" width="1">";s:17:"post_image_height";i:770;s:16:"post_image_width";i:1250;s:11:"post_visits";i:2;s:18:"post_twitterShares";i:4;s:19:"post_facebookShares";i:1;s:16:"post_totalShares";i:5;s:16:"post_socialScore";i:9;s:13:"post_virality";i:13;s:9:"blog_name";s:9:"Mind Soup";s:16:"blog_description";s:22:"Blowing your mind away";s:8:"blog_url";s:28:"http://www.mindsoupblog.com/";s:11:"blog_author";s:14:"Mohamed Hijazi";s:28:"blog_author_twitter_username";s:8:"mindsoup";s:13:"blog_rss_feed";s:47:"http://www.mindsoupblog.com/feeds/posts/default";s:9:"blog_tags";s:4:"tech";s:2:"id";i:92;s:11:"blog_active";i:1;s:24:"blog_last_post_timestamp";i:1402662780;}i:14;O:8:"stdClass":26:{s:7:"post_id";i:31225;s:8:"post_url";s:94:"http://www.executive-magazine.com/business-finance/finance/presella-mawarid-startup-investment";s:10:"post_title";s:15:"Just the ticket";s:10:"post_image";s:73:"http://www.executive-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/presella.jpg";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:123:"It was a long time coming.

When Al-Mawarid Bank and local startup Presella jointly announced the bank’s equity participation in the company yesterday, it had been almost a year since Banque du Liban (BDL) created the funding mechanism that would support this type of deal. Mawarid’s investment in Presella was the first to be approved by the central bank under this system, whereby the company will be receiving $200,000 from the bank for an equity stake of just under 21 percent. This suggests the shareholders value the company at around $1 million.</p>
<p>The key element behind the deal is <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.executive-magazine.com%2Fbusiness-finance%2Fbusiness%2Fin-need-of-nurture&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNG6Kyyogca13hc2OqGDuuJTXCxhBA" target="_blank">Circular 331</a>, which was passed by the central bank in August of last year. Under this circular, the central bank subsidizes 75 percent of an equity investment by commercial banks into a startup company under an arrangement that allows commercial banks to buy treasury bills and sell them back to the central bank at a discounted rate.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fpresella.com%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNGkH_YB0fkJqBL6NambeiQoKx_xTQ" target="_blank">Presella</a> is an online ticketing platform that seeks to help event organizers reduce the financial risk of throwing events. The company offers normal services such as selling tickets, but also has a crowdfunding option whereby anyone organizing an event can set the minimum number of tickets that need to be sold for the event to take place. In about one and a half years, the startup has sold over $650,000 worth of tickets between hundreds of small and medium sized events, primarily in Beirut, followed by rollouts in Dubai and events in Cyprus and Turkey.</p>
<p><strong>Start from the bottom</strong></p>
<p>The company has certainly grown since its 2012 debut. Presella was one of the eight startups that graduated from <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.executive-magazine.com%2Fbusiness-finance%2Fbusiness%2Fmoney-for-ideas&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNHEBqT_Q-NKTV_zQrhWjgUlhflUbg" target="_blank">former acceleration program Seeqnce</a>, which provided its first round of funding of $76,500, split between cash and in-kind services such as office space and an internet connection.</p>
<p>It was through a pitching session held by Seeqnce in 2013 that Presella first caught the eye of <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.executive-magazine.com%2Fbusiness-finance%2Fbusiness%2Fmarwan-kheireddine-investing-in-local-startups&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNGSuRQ0CzbMZZg5fOwGDUYX10fNCQ" target="_blank">Marwan Kheireddine</a>, chair and general manager of Mawarid, major shareholder in Virgin Megastore in Lebanon and Saudi Arabia, and a former minister in the 2011–2014 government of Najib Mikati. Kheireddine had been invited to the pitching event as an angel investor. Earmarking them for investment, Kheireddine pushed forward when Circular 331 was promulgated.</p>
<p>Mawarid’s investment is part of Presella’s $300,000 second round of funding. In addition to the bank’s $200,000, the startup will receive $100,000 from a handful of Lebanese angel investors. The company plans on using the money to expand in the Emirati, Qatari and Saudi markets. “We are aiming to be a success story, to inspire entrepreneurs in Lebanon,” says cofounder Walid Singer.</p>
<p>The current shareholders include cofounders Singer and Louay Kadri, as well as a group shareholding that originated in the Seeqnce accelerator program. After the second funding round, Presella’s shareholders will include six new members, says Singer.</p>
<p>And Mawarid is letting them drive. The bank will take a board seat, but they will not engage with them as advisors, according to Kheireddine. “Being a bank on their board gives them credibility wherever they go, so we can open doors for them,” he says. “It is a relatively well structured board. Had we gone into another investment that was really brand new, right off the drawing board, the chances are we would position ourselves to play a bigger role in that company.”</p>
<p>According to Kheireddine, Mawarid is planning on exiting the company in five years, although the circular gives them up to seven years.</p>
<p><strong>Blazing the trail</strong></p>
<p>When Circular 331 was passed, it generated a lot of hype over the maximum of approximately $400 million that could be injected into the startup economy. But while the rate of investment has not been promising thus far, such deals may see an uptick now that the first bank has taken the plunge.</p>
<p>The central bank is currently looking through the documents of a total of five startups, but is aware of approximately 25–30 more in the process of applying, according to Marianne Hoayek, head of the Executive Office at BDL.</p>
<p>A handful of banks are actively looking for deals to invest in. For his part, Kheireddine plans to have Mawarid invest in at least 30 companies. The bank is in the process of looking at three other investments, one of which it has already applied to the central bank for, according to Kheireddine.</p>
<p>As far as diversification goes, Mawarid can invest up to $3 million into startup companies, according to the terms of the circular which limit the amount of investment a bank can make into startup companies to 3 percent of a bank’s tier 1 capital. In Mawarid’s case, this capital stands at around $100 million, according to the chair. It is also limited to investments of $300,000 or less, since the circular defines that a bank can only invest a tenth of the 3 percent into any one company.</p>
<p>While it is difficult to project how many startups will see investment over the next couple of years, Kheireddine was adamant that conservative banks in Lebanon need to change their culture in terms of how they perceive startups and begin to understand how to invest in them (see <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.executive-magazine.com%2Fbusiness-finance%2Fbusiness%2Fmarwan-kheireddine-investing-in-local-startups&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNGSuRQ0CzbMZZg5fOwGDUYX10fNCQ" target="_blank">Q&A with Marwan Kheireddine</a>).</p>
<p>Mawarid’s investment certainly creates a stronger potential for other banks to follow suit, now that a precedent is set. “We knew that Circular 331 had to be ironed out,” says Kheireddine. “There were a lot of things that needed clarification internally within the central bank and within each bank. So we went through that first investment with the intention of paving the way for other investments to come.”</p>
<p>To apply for central bank funding, the startup and the commercial bank have to sign a term sheet, which is sent to the central bank along with other documentation such as the business plan. The central bank makes sure that the company is compliant with Circular 331, and then advances 75 percent of the funds through the treasury bill mechanism while the bank comes up with the other 25 percent.</p>
<p>If the investment is profitable, the commercial bank has to split gains from dividends or the sale of the shares 50–50 with the central bank.</p>
<p>“Success will come; the question is whether it’s going to be huge or small,” says Kheireddine. “I think that we will end up investing in at least a few hundred companies, utilizing a few million dollars of the $400 million, and making some money on some of the companies. But that’s the least that I would like to see.”</p>

He is currently the CEO of Zoomaal, an initiative funded by four major institutional investors and recently featured on CNN, Forbes, Wamda, and IHT. Zoomaal is the leading crowd-funding platform that aims at funding Arab creative projects. Abdallah has won more than 10 awards in entrepreneurship and computer science, and was recently selected as one of Lebanon’s Top 20 entrepreneurs for 2013.</div><div><b><span>When did you first get acquainted with the Lebanese entrepreneurship scene?</span></b>Late 2009 was my first involvement. This is when I first heard the word “Entrepreneurship” from the YallaStartup group founded by Habib Haddad, Elie Khoury and Sami Shalabi.</div><div><b><span>What is eClub and what are some of its latest projects?</span></b>eClub stands for “The Entrepreneurship Club”. Our mission is to support and promote youth entrepreneurship in Lebanon. The club was founded in 2011 at AUB, and it now operates around Lebanon under an NGO. Our latest project is The LEAGUE, an exclusive support network for young established entrepreneurs to lobby with the private and public sectors, and create a platform for the exchange of know-how among established entrepreneurs.</div><div><b><span>What are the projects (start-ups/ideas) that you implemented before Zoomaal?</span></b>I have started several projects prior to Zoomaal. In 2009, I co-founded LebAutos with my high school friends Ahmad Rabih and Ahmad Kammaz, a platform to browse and buy used cars in Lebanon. After LebAutos, I founded YallaSMEme (2009), an SMS service for greetings; CrowdVolt (2010), a platform for inter-company “protests”; Rifflex (2010); Askolar (2011); and finally Zoomaal (2012).</div><div><span><b>Zoomaal is a leading crowd-funding platform in the Middle East. Tell us why you chose to invest in this </b></span><span>idea?</span><br>I’ve been always passionate about supporting young entrepreneurs, maybe because I had this problem myself. The major contributor to my repetitive failures was the lack of access to funding for someone who is a student, unexperienced, over-ambitious, and full of ideas. I want to change that.</div><div><b><span>Perhaps one of the weaknesses of Zoomaal is that it does not support partial funding of campaigns, unlike other platforms. Many Arab campaigns are being hosted on other platforms for this reason. Why did you choose not to allow such an option on Zoomaal?</span></b>It is actually a strength not a weakness. Although the partial funding model seems more straight-forward and offers more flexibility to the project owner, the consequences of it are diminishing to the contributors. Imagine that you supported a $50,000-project with $2,000 and the project ends up failing. In partial funding, the project owner will get the $2,000 although they probably can’t do anything with it, because their project needs $50,000. $2,000 is far from being close to the funding goal. With the All-or-Nothing model, we guarantee to the contributor that their funds are not released unless the project is successful. The All-or-Nothing model pushes project owners to share their project more, motivates contributors to fund projects so that the project owner can collect all the funds raised till now.</div><div><b><span>Are there any crowd-funding laws in Lebanon? Zoomaal is not registered in Lebanon, but in the US, right? Why is that?</span></b>Unlike equity crowd-funding (which needs a law to regulate it), reward-based crowd-funding is legal by nature. However, we have faced a lot of problems from banks in Lebanon who refused processing credit cards for Zoomaal because of concerns on money-laundering and anti-terrorism associated with crowd-funding. We found that incorporating the company in the US will make it much easier for us to overcome the educational gap of Lebanese banks with regards to crowd-funding.</div><div><b><span>In your opinion, what are the biggest challenges of entrepreneurs in Lebanon and the Middle East?</span></b>Access to funding, exit strategies, political stability—they’re all related</div><div><b><span>What is your relationship like with the Lebanese online community?</span></b>I’m always up-to-date to the latest hypes happening on social media. However, due to my commitment to Zoomaal and getting things done, my personal engagement on Twitter and Facebook is semi-active.</div><div><b><span>What is the proudest moment of your career so far?</span></b>Every time a project gets funded on Zoomaal, I feel like it’s my project. It makes me feel happy that Zoomaal is realizing dreams and saving them from fading away.</div><br><div></div><br><div><b><span>What advice would you give to fresh graduates who are considering to build their own career rather than apply for jobs?</span></b>Stop giving yourself excuses. No, you don’t need 5 years of experience to start a business, you can do it now. And now with platforms like Zoomaal, funding is the least concern you should have. I advise every entrepreneur and wanna-be entrepreneur to read the book “Lean Startup” by Eric Ries.</div><div></div><div></div><br><div itemprop="articleBody"><i>A version of this article was <a href="http://cloud961.com/blog/2014/05/abdallah-absi-i-started-zoomaal-due-to-my-repetitive-failures-caused-by-lack-of-funding/" target="_blank">originally published</a> in Cloud961's May issue.

He was involved in pushing <a href="http://www.bdl.gov.lb/circulars/intermediary/5/37/0/Intermediate-Circulars.html" target="_blank">Circular 331</a> in coordination with former Minister of Telecommunications Nicolas Sehnaoui. Executive sat with him to talk about Mawarid’s recent investment in local startup Presella.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>So are you Presella’s number one fan?</strong></p>
<p>Does it really matter? I don’t think so. What is important is that they get to work, and prove that their business plan is achievable, and that they can create jobs and make returns.</p>
<p> </p>
<div><p>I think that at most we will be financing semi-crazy ideas.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>You actually have some entrepreneurial and investment experience. Are you nervous that other banks who are directly investing into startups don’t have this kind of knowledge?</strong></p>
<p>No, I think that the challenge banks will have, which we will also have as a bank, is changing their mentality from lenders to investors. Because the two things are totally different. When you lend someone money, you’re lending them with the intention and you’re taking all the required precautions to ensure that they will pay you back the principal amount that they borrowed plus all interest and charges and what have you. Now if you are investing, you’re taking a totally different approach, you’re looking at the business model, you’re looking at the management capabilities, you’re looking at the opportunity of success. But then you may lose money. And bankers are not designed — their DNA does not really work well with losing money. So there is a culture shift that needs to take place in banks in order to move them from great lenders and knowing exactly how to lend, to great investors and thinking how to invest.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>But even with a culture shift, isn’t this a very risky venture for banks who have no past experience in investing, and who are notoriously conservative?</strong></p>
<p>I honestly think that not all banks are going to take this opportunity. It was very wise by the central bank to force banks to provide 25 percent [of any investment]. Because had this not been there, the market would have probably seen a lot of lousy investments. But the fact that banks have to put up 25 percent of any investment from their own money, means basically that there is not going to be an investment that is not well analyzed and not well looked at. So that will protect the system, basically.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Do you thinks banks will look into these ventures as genuine profit making opportunities or do you think it’s going to start more as a corporate social responsibility (CSR) policy by banks who want to show that they’re dynamic players in the ecosystem?</strong></p>
<p>I think a few banks will use that as a CSR initiative. And you know what? That’s fine. Big deal. At the end of the day, they are taking a risk in investing in companies. They are going to lose 25 percent of their investment if they choose badly, and if they don’t do enough investments as a policy, the chances of them losing all their investment is huge.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Isn’t it also risky for the central bank?</strong></p>
<p>When the central bank [decided] this, we assumed 1 out of 10, or 1 out of 15 [startups] would make it.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Aren’t these figures a global rule of thumb? How do we know if it will apply to Lebanon?</strong></p>
<p>We don’t know. But I think we will perform slightly better than the average international performance, mostly because the investment decision will be taken by banks that are conservative in nature. So in my mind, we’re not going to be financing crazy ideas. I think that at most we will be financing semi-crazy ideas.</p>
<p>But if you end up investing in a few thousand companies, by sheer application of the statistics, the central bank should be benefiting. I think Armageddon for all of us is if we only invest in a few companies, and then don’t find anything else. Then the chances are we are losing all of our investments — but then it’s not the 400 million, it’s a very small amount. So statistically speaking, the probability of success should be higher than what we have seen internationally, only because banks are more conservative in their decisionmaking. Irrespective of how entrepreneurial you are going to push them to be, they will still be conservative.</p>

How could people vote for a president, Bashar al-Assad,  during a conflict that has killed over 160,000 people, and a man that  has ruled Syria since 2000, and his father before him since 1971? <br><br>People  must have been intimidated and forced to do so, fearing for their lives  if they did not vote, went some accusations in the press. Others stated  that people were paid to turn up. <br><br>That an estimated 10 million  Syrians voted in Lebanon, Jordan and Syria appeared antithetical to the  anti-Assad narrative in the mainstream media since the uprising started  in 2011; the narrative that Syrians were overwhelmingly against  dictatorship and were fighting for freedom and democracy.<br><br>As is  so often the case, such observation and analysis overlooks the fact that  the price of achieving such goals comes at a high cost for people and  the country. Stability and security are preferable to chaos. <br><br>Indeed,  Syrians had looked on with horror at what happened in Iraq following  the US-led invasion in 2003, and how the country splintered apart amid  brutal sectarian warfare and terrorist attacks. <br><br>Syrians also  looked at neighboring Lebanon, from which Syria withdrew in 2005 after a  29-year military presence, and did not want the Lebanese-style  "democracy" of corrupt political dynasties and sectarian parties either.  <br><br>The Assad government naturally capitalized on such sentiments  and made it part of their narrative of the conflict, that terrorist  insurgents, primarily Sunni extremists, were bent on destroying the  country and were aided externally by the Persian Gulf states of Saudi  Arabia, Qatar and Kuwait, alongside the West. It is a narrative that has  clearly worked, with 88.7 percent of people voting for Assad and a 73.4  percent voter turnout.<br><br>That the election was not overly  transparent, that millions were not able to vote in or outside of the  country - such as in opposition-held areas - and that no members of the  opposition itself were on the ballot naturally raises questions about  its credibility. Yet at the same time, those criticizing the Syrian  elections as a farce were not as quick to say the same about Egypt's  presidential elections that happened at the same time, with Abdel Fattah  al-Sisi getting 96.7 percent of the vote while only 47.5 percent  reportedly voted. <br><br>Indeed, in Egypt, voting was extended for an  extra day not because of overwhelming turnout, but because not enough  people had voted. But Egypt is pro-West and pro-Gulf whereas Syria is  not, so the narrative has to be different.<br><br>Yet this is not to  imply that there is no strong opposition to Assad. There is, whether  from Islamic groups or others, while many Syrians do not feel  represented by the divided opposition itself. <br><br>Syrians did  protest against the "blood elections." A recent poll by the Arab Center  for Research and Policy Studies found that 78 percent of Syrian  respondents inside and outside of refugee camps viewed the presidential  elections as illegitimate, and 64 percent held the opinion that the  ideal solution to the crisis would be through a change in the current  regime.<br><br>So what next, now that Assad is in for a third term as  president? The regime has clearly been given a popularity boost from the  public, and will go on to try to cement that position. Damascus has  political and military support from Iran, and at the international level  from Russia and China.<br><br>Getting to that stage will be the big  challenge. In the meantime, the conflict is set to get even more  polarized.

</section></p>
<p>Students from Qatar and Bahrain will represent the region at the Worldwide Finals of Imagine Cup 2014 – Microsoft’s established global student technology competition. Held for the first time in 2014, the Pan-Arab Imagine Cup Semi-Finals hosted 23 teams from 12 Arab countries.</p>
<p>Challenged to innovate across Microsoft’s technology platforms, the students competed with each team presenting projects that tackle some of the world’s most pressing problems. More than 140 students, mentors and judges from Algeria, Bahrain, Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco, Oman, Palestine, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Tunisia and the United Arab Emirates took part in the Semi-Finals, which culminated with the June 3 crowning ceremony.</p>
<p>Following two rigorous days of qualification rounds in Doha with Qatar’s Minister of Information and Communications Technology attending the final deliberations,</p>
<p>Microsoft hosted a press conference on Wednesday morning to discuss the winning projects and their potential impact.</p>
<p>Following the announcement of the winners,Qatar’s Minister of Information and Communications Technology, Her Excellency Dr. Hessa Al Jaber, said: “Each year, Imagine Cup brings together three things I am truly passionate about: technology, youth and imagination. Two impressive projects from Qatar University – ‘I Copy You’ and ‘Techno Commando Squad’ – have made Qatar proud and truly represented the country’s entrepreneurial spirit and talent over the past several days. This year, I am proud to see Qatar play host to the first Pan-Arab Semi-Finals and heartened to see Imagine Cup – an invaluable foundation for students and entrepreneurs to build their technology skills – grow a lasting legacy in the region. Over the past decade, Qatar has made great strides in building an advanced ICT sector and supporting the young people whose ideas move that sector forward. The skills that each student will take home from Imagine Cup are absolutely essential not only for building a business but for building successful careers in the generations to come. Congratulations to all teams and good luck in Seattle.”</p>
<p>I Copy You and Butterfly were named winners of the competition in the World Citizenship and Innovation categories, respectively.</p>
<p>Team “I Copy You” from Qatar University was announced the winner in the Citizenship category, after presenting low-cost educational software designed to build communications skills among children with autism. Utilizing Microsoft’s Kinect camera, the software detects the motions of the child and provides feedback to a RoboSapien – a low cost humanoid robot – which uses the information to mimic the movements of the child.</p>
<p>Team “Butterfly” from Bahrain was announced winner in the Innovation category, after presenting a project called “Nail Polish Mixer; a mobile application controlled by one machine that enables women to create their own nail polish mix, test different colors, match it with skin types, and choose between three shades of color (normal, glitter and matte) then share it across all social media platforms.</p>
<p>World Citizenship honors the software application project with the greatest potential to make a positive impact on the betterment of humanity, while the Innovation category rewards apps that deliver technology innovations that advance user experiences in areas such as social networks, search. Palestine’s Team Humanity, for example, developed HopeSystem – a Windows 8 app facilitating communication between those with hearing deficiencies, their friends, families and communities. The app introduces an algorithm for Arabic Natural Language Processing, which the team plans to market as an independent product.</p>
<p>All projects were scored by an expert panel on their concept, execution and feasibility. Additionally, judges from across the Arab world gathered in Doha and selected the six-short listed teams whose projects they believed had the most social impact in the market. Panel experts included: Naseem Tuffaha, Online Evangelism Senior Director – Microsoft Corporation; AbenKvoor , Developer Experience Group Lead, Middle East and Africa; Ahmed Adel, Sales and Operations Director – Microsoft Corporation, Middle East and Africa; Amintas Lopes Neto, Director Developers and Startups – Microsoft Corporation, Middle East and Africa; and Michael Mansour, DPE Lead – Microsoft Gulf, and Nabil Nuseibeh, Chief Operations Officer – Ebla Corporation;</p>
<p>“We are very excited to represent the state of Qatar and the Arab region in the World finals this July in Seattle. We believe this is a huge responsibility that we must fulfill till the very end, and we thank Microsoft for supporting throughout all this period, and for giving us the chance to accomplish our dreams.” stated the Qatari team.</p>
<p>“We would like to thank Microsoft for this wonderful experience, and we are both are very excited to take our idea forward and compete with the rest of the teams in Seattle. Thank you Microsoft for helping us transform our dream into reality, and hopefully one day, you will see our idea sold in the market.” announced the Bahraini team.</p>
<p>“Congratulations to I Copy You andButterflyand each competitor for making Imagine Cup’s first Pan-Arab Semi-Finals a massive success,” said Samer Abu-Ltaif, Regional General Manager of Microsoft Gulf. “At Microsoft, we believe in the innovative power of the region and the talent that is based here.Imagine Cup is designed to cultivate that spirit of entrepreneurialism and build skills throughout a year-long engagement.Microsoft has been a longstanding partner helping to power innovation through technology in the region – a top priority for creating economic opportunity and building skills for the future. Our hope is that all students taking part in the Imagine Cup Pan-Arab Semi-Finals will use it as a foundation to grow their entrepreneurial skills and go on to start up their own business. I congratulate the winners and wish them luck as they represent the region in the Worldwide Finals in Seattle. We will be rooting for you!”</p>
<p>For the two winning teams, the journey has just begun. On July 29, 35 teams will advance to the WW finals, 6 of which are from MEA and 2 of MEA are from the Pan-Arab event in Seattle, Washington (U.S.) to compete for top prizes and support for their ideas through special competitions, including the Facebook Creativity Award and Skype Award. New in 2014, the top team in each category at the Worldwide Finals will be given the opportunity to take part in Imagine Cup Boot Camp, during which they will receive hands-on mentorship and project development support from Microsoft and industry experts.</p>
<p>Projects from the region have a history of success at Imagine Cup. From the Middle East and North Africa, teams from Jordan, Uganda, Egypt and Algeria have all taken top prizes at the Worldwide Finals in recent years. At the 2013 Imagine Cup World Finals in Russia, team MASKed Ninjas from Egypt received the App Fast Track award. The team developed Videolator, a Windows 8/Windows phone application that provides the most relevant video to an article, a piece of news text that can be scanned with a Windows 8 or Windows Phone device.</p>
<p>In 2011, Team OaSys from Jordan developed Horizon – a software and hardware system that allows people who do not have use of their hands or arms to use a computer. It tracks head movements and translates these movements into mouse movements. Users are able to have full control of a computer and cellphone, browse the Internet, type, and connect with ease at a low cost. At the 2012 World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, OaSys was awarded a grant of $75,000, software and cloud computing services and support, and connections to Microsoft’s network of investors, nongovernmental organization and business partners.</p>
<p>Supporters of the Imagine Cup Pan-Arab Semi-Finals include: Ebla Computer Consultancy as the event’s Diamond Sponsor; Qatar’s Ministry of Information and Communication Technology (TumuhaTEC) as the event’s Technology Partner; the World Innovation Summit for Education (WISE) as the event’s Education Partner; and Nokia as the Communications Partner.</p>
