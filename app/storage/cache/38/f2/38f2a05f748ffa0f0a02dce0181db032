Every night since the onset of the games, crowds gather around TV screens, at home or in commercial venues, and loud cheers mixed in with the occasional firework are a common celebratory occurrence.</p>
<p>World Cup fever strikes the country at full force every time, and commercial venues once again find themselves in the familiar position of first trying to lure viewers away from the more cost-effective home gatherings, now that the games are being aired for free, and to attract them into their venue as opposed to competitors.</p>
<p><b>Success of pop-up venues</b></p>
<p><span>Keeping in mind that the broadcasting rights’ contract for commercial venues is different than the home viewing deals and comes with a much heftier price tag — starting at $3,000 and going up to $20,000 according to Mohamad Al Khatib from MK Electronics which supplied most commercial venues in Beirut with the beIN satellite receiver — one has to wonder if this investment is a wise one, and if hospitality venues will get a good return for their buck.</span></p>
<p>One type of commercial venture that is successful in capitalizing on the football hype is that of the pop-up venue constructed especially for World Cup viewing, such as Beirut Fan Park (BFP) in Beirut Waterfront or the Hyundai Football Village in Zaitunay Bay. Such ventures typically recreate the feeling of watching the games live through stadium style bleacher seating, huge LED screens and half-time entertainment such as mascots or cheerleaders. Loud and fiery, they are favored by diehard fans or by those looking for a change from restaurant viewing.</p>
<p>Entry fees start off at $7, depending on the park, and can reach up to $20 toward the final games. Organizers rely on sponsors to cover most of their investment; Hadi Hibri, one of the partners in VII Management which is organizing BFP, says they invested over $300,000 into the park including the broadcasting rights — but that sum was mainly covered by their 30 sponsors, and the park itself was “supported by Solidere.” Hibri explains that they also rented out the spaces in their food court to a variety of eateries at a fixed price, thereby increasing their profit margin as well. Solicet, the team behind Zaitunay Bay’s park, also lists around a dozen sponsors and supporters who covered most of their event’s fees.</p>
<p><span>World Cup parks also aim to increase pedestrian traffic in the surrounding area. Amal Khoury, communication manager at Zaitunay Bay, says they offered the venue to Solicit because “we were interested in the footfall to encourage the restaurants’ business and to allow those who don’t want to be in a restaurant to view the games in the public areas of Zaitunay Bay.”</span></p>

<p><b>Nil-nil for some restaurants and bars</b></p>
<p><span>Meanwhile, restaurants and bars have mixed feelings regarding the season’s impact on their venues, acknowledging the increased footfall but saying that it’s generally not matched with a significant increase in revenue. </span></p>
<p><span>Charlie Freim, owner of Garcia’s in Hamra and Central Station in Mar Mkhayel, sees screening the World Cup as an added value service he provides his customers which doesn’t make extra profit during the World Cup season; in fact he makes around 30 to 35 percent less than the usual average when the place is full. “People generally tend to consume less during the games and focus more on beers and appetizers rather than cocktails or meals. Also, many times it is just men alone who come to watch the game so they spend less than when they come with a group that has women,” explains Freim. </span></p>
<p><span>Turnover is also lower during the games. For Toni Rizk, CEO of Tri Concepts which runs several pubs on Downtown’s Uruguay Street, many customers spend over three hours in the venue over just a couple of beers.</span></p>
<p>Faced with this situation, many bars and restaurants are offering set menus of drinks and appetizers, or discounts and promotional items, in an effort to both build hype around their venues as the place to be during the World Cup and ensure at least a minimum order, which would go toward covering their cost.</p>
<p>Other venues cover part of their World Cup investment through sponsors; Creditbank sponsored the broadcasting rights fees for Casper & Gambini’s for example. None of the venues Executive spoke to opted for minimum charge strategy as that would drive viewers away.</p>
<p>However, all restaurants and bars Executive spoke to said that it would not be viable for them not to air the games while their competitors are doing so right next to them as that gives others an edge over them. “We show the World Cup because not doing so means that our customers would choose to go elsewhere during that period,” says Rita Saati, marketing officer at Roadster’s.</p>
<p><b>The world’s carnival</b></p>
<p><span>Ussama Makarem, CEO of Clé Bar in Hamra, feels that broadcasting the World Cup would not make mathematical sense for smaller venues as people generally choose to watch the games in larger venues and so their returns won’t add up. However, for Clé, which has a seating capacity of 120, Makarem says he would be losing profits and clientele if he didn’t air the games. </span></p>
<p><span>Despite the claims of flat profit margins, many venues report that footfall does increase during World Cup month, especially during weekdays when people are normally more inclined to stay at home rather than go out. </span></p>
<p><span>Speaking for The Peninsula in Dbayeh, Maryse Tebcharany says they have been fully booked since the opening match and have had to “reject tens of reservations each night to maintain quality.” </span></p>
<p>Capitole Rooftop Bar in the downtown area has noticed an increase in both the numbers of reservations and in the number within the reserving groups. “Before the World Cup, we used to get reservations for groups of maximum six or seven. Now we get reservations for groups of around ten to fourteen in our dinner section because people like to watch the World Cup in big groups while having a bite,” said Capitole’s marketing manager.</p>
<p><span>As the World Cup carnival rolls along, it seems that the hospitality venues should avoid focusing on the profit lines and just enjoy the games. “This is one of the biggest events on Earth: you have the most people who watch it all over the world and it happens once every four years, spread over 31 days. I personally enjoy festivals and think it’s also nice to have a good time,” says Makarem.</span></p>

The Iran-Syria-Hezbollah  alliance, aligned with Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki in Iraq, had emerged victorious in recent years, which is why the Assad government remains firmly in place, if only in about one-third of the country. </p><p>That alliance is under pressure today, as Iran’s three partners in Arab Western Asia all face challenging new realities. Assad continues to hold onto power only by bombing and destroying parts of his country, Maliki’s incumbency in  Iraq is in deep trouble and he is unlikely to stay in power, while  Hezbollah is fighting inside  Syria and may have to go to the aid of the Iraqi prime minister. This creates new logistical and political challenges for a formidable organization that forged its credibility, legitimacy and power by defending  Lebanon from Israeli aggression, not by fighting in other Arab countries. </p><p>All three of these Arab parties depend heavily on Iran  for logistical, financial and political support, and Iraq, Syria,  Lebanon and  Iran face new vulnerabilities that did not exist a year ago, or even three months ago, when considering the challenge that ISIS has posed to them all. </p><p>The sudden renewal in the past week of American military assistance to the Iraqi government and the anti-Assad Syrian rebels will do what foreign military interventions in Arab West Asia have done for millennia: exacerbate the political equation and intensify military action all around, leaving the region more scarred and brittle than it was before the fighting started, without resolving the underlying problems of incompetent and criminal governance that generated conflict in the first place.</p><p>Neither the United States  nor  Iran and their allies can control foreign lands for very long by relying primarily on military power. And despite their determination and large armies, neither of them can prevent the rise of militant fanatics such as ISIS when prevailing governance and living conditions follow the pattern we have seen in recent decades across much of the Arab world. Every power has learned this lesson over and over again, including  Syria in Lebanon, and the U.S. and  Iran in Iraq. </p><p>The U.S., Iran, Syria,  Hezbollah and the Iraqi and other Arab governments will now effectively work together to militarily contain and push back ISIS troops, while simultaneously working politically to weaken each other. The weakness in the policies of both regional ideological camps is their misguided conviction that local actors in places such as Tripoli, Lebanon; Deir al-Zor, Syria; or Fallujah,  Iraq define themselves and respond politically to the same impulses that shape identities and interests in places such as Qom and Kansas City.</p><p>When  Hezbollah and  Iran move quickly to support their friends in Syria, and the U.S. and its allies move slowly, the result is what we have seen in Syria: the consolidation of the Assad regime, but in ever-smaller parts of the country, along with the birth of new and more dangerous fighting groups such as ISIS.  Syria is not a victory that  Iran and  Hezbollah can brag about. </p><p>The critical criterion for success lies in the second issue I mentioned above, which is, from the U.S. perspective, how to define a “moderate” opposition group to support. This is a truly childish approach to waging ideological and military battle abroad, and guarantees failure, as we have seen in the recent trends in  Syria and  Iraq during the last three years. </p><p>The critical criterion for supporting a foreign group of fighters or politicians is local legitimacy, not “moderation” defined in distant lands. But legitimacy is an issue that the U.S., Iran, Arab powers and all foreign armies ignore as they march into battle in foreign lands. That is why they leave behind such ravages and chaos when they march home a few years later, staggered and bewildered at the furies they released and encountered and the sandstorms and cultural forces that momentarily blinded them. </p><p>Moving decisively to bolster legitimate local forces breeds success. Moving gingerly to identify people who will friend you on Facebook is really stupid. </p><p>Rami G. Khouri  is published twice weekly by THE DAILY STAR.

<p><span>Two of these came via loans worth €45 million ($61.3 million) apiece to Byblos Bank and Fransabank. The other two were equity investments, one of €11 million ($15 million) in First National Bank and the other €20 million ($27.2 million) in regional private equity fund EuroMena III. </span></p>
<p><span>“It seemed important to us in this difficult period to show that the Lebanese financial sector and the Lebanese economy represent a good investment opportunity,” says Philippe de Fontaine Vive, the vice president of the EIB.</span></p>
<p><span>The loans to the local banks are to be channeled into the economy at a multiplier effect of two to support lending to SMEs, according to de Fontaine Vive. “We request the bank to lend double of what we are lending to the bank. So it’s a legal commitment of at least two, but nothing prevents these banks from being even more efficient,” he says. The SMEs to be invested in would be held to certain good governance principles, overseen by the EIB, according to de Fontaine Vive.</span></p>
<p><span>With a 12-year maturity granted to the commercial banks, they are also expected on their side to lend for periods up to 12 years, according to the vice president — maturities he claims are hard to find on today’s market. As far as interest rates go, de Fontaine Vive says these have not yet been set and will partly depend on the terms set between the banks and the SMEs.</span></p>
<p><strong>EIB’s relationship with Lebanon</strong></p>
<p><span>The financing falls under a long-standing EIB policy of promoting the EU’s policy objectives overseas under its Facility for Euro-Mediterranean Investment and Partnership (FEMIP). According to the <a href="http://www.eib.europa.eu/attachments/country/lebanon_2014_en.pdf" target="_blank">EIB’s website</a>, these objectives are encouraging the modernization and liberalization of economies of the EU’s partner countries in the Mediterranean.</span></p>
<p><span>FEMIP’s financing to Lebanon reached €740 million ($1 billion) between 2002 (the date of its establishment) and 2012, according to a <a href="http://www.byblosbank.com/Library/Files/Lebanon/Publications/Economic%20Research/Lebanon%20This%20Week/Lebanon%20This%20Week_327.pdf" target="_blank">2013 Byblos Bank report</a>. This is equivalent to 5.2 percent of its investments in the Mediterranean region, which totaled €14.2 billion ($19.3 billion) in the same period, in Morocco, Egypt, Tunisia, Syria, Israel, Lebanon, Algeria, Jordan and the West Bank and Gaza, the report said.</span></p>
<p><span>Some of the agreements signed most recently represent just another facet of these institutions’ long relationship with the EIB. Byblos Bank received two prior loans from the EIB — $60 million in 2005 and $87 million in 2007, according to a Byblos Bank press release.</span></p>
<p><span>Similarly, this is the third equity investment the EIB makes in an equity fund managed by the Capital Trust Group. The €20 million ($27 million) investment in EuroMena III was preceded by $17 million in EuroMena II and $12 million in the first EuroMena fund.</span></p>
<p><span>Rare, however, is the FNB investment, which according to de Fontaine Vive is the EIB’s first significant equity stake in the capital of a Lebanese bank. Like the other financial institution, FNB intends to establish a long-lasting relationship. “In this transaction what we value more is the strategic partnership,” says Rami El Nimer, chair and general manager of FNB. The EIB’s financing will play into FNB’s capital increase of $40 million, $25 million of which will be coming from existing shareholders, according to Nimer.</span></p>
<p><strong>The perks of international money</strong></p>
<p>Funding from foreign financial institutions certainly has its perks. In EuroMena’s case, their relationship with the EIB and the reputation they’ve gained from it has facilitated subsequent investment. With their third EuroMena fund raising $100 million so far, the $27.2 million EIB investment was the largest investment among a pool of international financial institutions, which invested a combined total of $56 million in EuroMena III. Other investors in this pool included the DEG (Deutsche Investitions- und Entwicklungsgesellschaft), the International Finance Corporation and Électricité de France.</p>
<p><span>“The EIB, DEG and IFC are as important because they are development financial institutions that do a very thorough due diligence before they invest in a fund. They impose on a fund very tough, thorough controls because it’s public money. And they don’t mess with public money,” says Romen Mathieu, managing director of the EuroMena fund at the Capital Trust Group.</span></p>
<p><span>Having already raised $100 million for their third fund, Mathieu was confident that having such investors under their belt would facilitate meeting their closing target between $150 million and $200 million: “When you have such investors with you, other investors come along.”</span></p>

All took place after the offensive in Iraq by the Islamic State in Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS), which sent shockwaves throughout the Middle East. And all come at a sensitive time for Lebanon, which has been unable to elect a president to replace Michel Sleiman.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>However, this is very little to go on. But it&rsquo;s a fact that while the security services, bolstered by those of Hezbollah, were unable to prevent any of the bomb explosions that took place earlier this year in the southern suburbs, despite myriad checkpoints, in the space of a week they have repeatedly, if not interrupted attacks, forced alleged bombers to detonate their loads early.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It&rsquo;s possible that the security services have gotten a hold of accurate intelligence information, but that doesn&rsquo;t apply to the blast in Tayyouneh, which occurred after an alert officer from General Security became suspicious of a driver. As for the bomb in Dahr al-Baydar, the versions of the story told by General Security Director Abbas Ibrahim and the Internal Security Forces (ISF) did not match, and indeed tended to contradict one another.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>During this period the intensity of the panic has been multiplied, propelled by reports of terrorism cells being uncovered in Tripoli, purported threats against Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri followed by his cancellation of an Amal conference last week, and statements, with little corroborative evidence, that we are witnessing a terrorism offensive by ISIS.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This sense of panic has been further intensified by arrests of foreigners in Beirut hotels and elsewhere. Last week two Tunisians were interviewed by Al-Jadeed after spending the morning detained by the ISF. They were among the more than 22 people brought in on the day of the Dahr al-Baydar explosion. Far from being hardened jihadists, the pair was in Beirut to attend an Arab nationalist conference.&nbsp;Reports&nbsp;the next day indicated that several of those detained had been set free.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So where is all this leading? A great deal remains unclear or elicits skepticism: security services that behave like James Bond; official explanations that are immediately questionable; assassination lists that keep getting longer; and the near-automatic presumption that ISIS cells are involved.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>That is not to say that ISIS is a victim or that there are no terrorist cells in Lebanon. Far from it. ISIS is a real threat to the region, and would readily use terrorist actions to build on its credibility. But until now the evidence in Lebanon seems to be limited. All we have are suspicions, warnings of plots, but nothing that definitely tells us what is true and what isn&rsquo;t.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Maybe that&rsquo;s why certain Lebanese politicians view the panic in Lebanon as a manufactured effort to affect the outcome of the presidential election. In this view, Hezbollah and its allies seek to bring in a candidate of their choice to the presidency, thereby using the two elections scheduled this year &ndash; the presidential and parliamentary elections &ndash; to reinforce their hold over the country. According to this narrative, the Party finally feels that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad is relatively secure in power, and would like to reflect that reality within Lebanon.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In this context, Hezbollah has an interest in taking advantage of the security situation, and even in heightening the fear level. The theory is that Hezbollah has two favorite candidates in its scabbard: the army commander, Jean Qahwaji, and Michel Aoun. To impose them on the political scene, the argument goes, their elevation must be justified by the unstable security situation, making the public more willing to embrace either man.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Neither Aoun nor Qahwaji has been accused in any way of involvement in this purported conspiracy. And given Interior Minister Nouhad Mashnouq&rsquo;s allegiance to&nbsp;March 14, he is hardly someone likely to be complicit in such a scheme.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>And yet one thing can be said if this theory is true: it is not Aoun who would benefit most from a public backlash against the climate of insecurity in the country, but rather Qahwaji, as army commander. Therefore, putting both men in the same basket may be misleading. Hezbollah may be keeping the prospect of an Aoun presidency alive both to neutralize the general, who avidly desires the post, and to absorb potential reactions against Qahwaji, who may remain the party&rsquo;s first choice as president.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Indeed, Aounist suspicions of such a scenario were evident in an ambiguous&nbsp;piece&nbsp; penned by Jean Aziz last week in&nbsp;Al-Akhbar. Aziz, who is close to Aoun, looked back at how the Nahr al-Bared battle was used to bring Sleiman to power in 2008, blocking Aoun. His implication was that the latest violence may be used in the same way, though Aziz underlined that he was not accusing Jean Qahwaji of complicity in such a move.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Too many pieces of the puzzle are missing to decisively conclude what is going on. But there does seem to be a calculated intention to scare the Lebanese after months of relative calm.

But many developments...";s:7:"blog_id";N;s:14:"post_timestamp";i:1403780933;s:12:"post_content";s:4450:"<p>None of the people involved in security affairs in Lebanon expected an actual end to the wave of terror attacks in the country. But many developments in Lebanon, Syria, and Iraq have encouraged the suicide bombers’ handlers to execute new plans, a large part of which seems to have been prepared in haste, requiring recruits from outside Lebanon.</p><p>Well-placed sources have noted that as military operations along the Lebanese-Syrian border were moving on to the stage of “cleansing” the remaining pockets of militants who had escaped from the battles in the cities and towns of Qalamoun, armed Syrian factions began to regroup in a way that took into account the fact that most land routes between Syria and Lebanon are now off-limits, while avoiding measures taken by the Lebanese army in many regions, particularly in the border areas in the north and the Bekaa. </p><p>According to these sources, a green lightwas given to a new wave of attacks in Lebanonin order to counter the recent military and intelligence achievements of Hezbollah and the Lebanese army and law enforcement agencies. However, there were gaps in the plan, such as the need for recruits who are different from those used in the previous series of attacks. This prompted the handlers abroad to dispatch foreign operatives to Lebanon, who then deployed separately in various areas according to a plan to escape surveillance. </p><p>The same sources say that technical surveillance conducted by international intelligence services uncovered enough information to begin tracking and interception operations by the Lebanese side. The country was put on security alert, with the terrorist groups planning to target security services, and not just in the areas seen as Hezbollah strongholds. </p><p>The sources do not deny that Western security agencies have shown serious cooperation, but attribute this enthusiasm to the fact that the agencies in question have for a while been tracking jihadis returning to their countries. This was accompanied by a clear direction among the Takfiri forces behind these jihadis, especially the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) and its ilk, to expand the scope of their operations outside the Syrian battlefield, and take advantage of the combatants returning to their countries to seek their services there.</p><p>The sources believe that the terrorist groups are planning to carry out a significant number of terror attacks in Lebanon to benefit from the momentum of the sectarian agitation that has accompanied the war in Syria, and which was further reinforced by the recent events in Iraq. This is not to mention the fact that Lebanon is a suitable arena, especially since Islamist groups in the country often voice their grievances about being oppressed, meaning that their members are potential recruits for these operations, while the groups themselves can be used for logistical support.</p><p>The sources point out that there is no complete picture of what is happening yet, saying that the information and investigation has yet to reveal many unknown issues, most notably the places in which the suicide bombers are using to prepare their gear such as car bombs and suicide belts, and the full extent of the networks running these operations. However, the same sources say there is clear confusion in the terrorists’ work, indicating that some are in a hurry to attack certain targets, something that the sources say has helped intercept the terrorists and thwart some of their planned attacks. </p><p>It is worth noting in this regard that coordination and cooperation among various security agencies reflects a political situation that is markedly different from the one that previously prevailed. Furthermore, the Directorate General of General Security is strongly and seriously involved in the effort, while key officers in this agency seem to have become major targets for jihadi groups. </p><p>In conclusion, even though many in the government do not want to spread panic, the conduct of the security agencies reflects a state of genuine concern regarding a wave of attacks that may not be possible to fully stop for the time being. However, it is possible to say that the terrorist groups have so far failed to achieve their objectives, whether in reaching their direct targets or creating a climate of fully blown internal tension. </p><p>This article is an edited translation from the Arabic Edition.</p>";s:17:"post_image_height";i:520;s:16:"post_image_width";i:780;s:11:"post_visits";i:18;s:18:"post_twitterShares";i:0;s:19:"post_facebookShares";i:14;s:16:"post_totalShares";i:14;s:16:"post_socialScore";i:29;s:13:"post_virality";i:21;s:9:"blog_name";N;s:16:"blog_description";N;s:8:"blog_url";N;s:11:"blog_author";N;s:28:"blog_author_twitter_username";N;s:13:"blog_rss_feed";N;s:9:"blog_tags";N;s:2:"id";N;s:11:"blog_active";N;s:24:"blog_last_post_timestamp";N;s:6:"col_id";i:5;s:8:"col_name";s:36:"Ibrahim al-Amin at Al-Akhbar English";s:16:"col_media_source";s:17:"Al-Akhbar English";s:13:"col_home_page";s:37:"http://english.al-akhbar.com/node/125";s:13:"col_shorthand";s:8:"iaminakh";s:26:"col_media_source_shorthand";s:9:"al_akhbar";s:27:"col_author_twitter_username";N;s:8:"col_tags";s:20:"columnists, politics";s:15:"col_description";s:51:"Ibrahim al-Amin is the Editor in Chief of Al-Akhbar";s:23:"col_last_post_timestamp";i:1403780933;}i:5;O:8:"stdClass":36:{s:7:"post_id";i:31864;s:8:"post_url";s:113:"http://dailystar.com.lb/Opinion/Columnist/2014/Jun-25/261466-the-presbyterian-church-takes-a-stand-on-israel.ashx";s:10:"post_title";s:47:"The Presbyterian Church takes a stand on Israel";s:10:"post_image";N;s:12:"post_excerpt";s:300:"A significant shift in political dynamics related to the Middle East took place in Detroit last weekend where the Presbyterian Church of the United States voted to withdraw its investments in three companies that profit from sales to organizations involved in the Israeli occupation of Palestinian...";s:7:"blog_id";N;s:14:"post_timestamp";i:1403676390;s:12:"post_content";s:5317:"<p>A significant shift in political dynamics related to the Middle East took place in Detroit last weekend where the Presbyterian Church  of the United States  voted to withdraw its investments in three companies that profit from sales to organizations involved in the Israeli occupation of Palestinian lands – Caterpillar, Motorola and Hewlett-Packard. </p><p>This was a significant milestone on the path toward a critical destination that has made Palestinian-Israeli peace-making impossible: holding Israel  accountable to universally accepted standards of law and morality for its occupation practices, and drawing a clear line between Western support for  Israel in its pre-1967 borders and the unacceptable colonial and apartheid-like practices of the Israeli occupation of Palestinian land.</p><p>The church decision will not have any significant impact on the companies themselves, or bring about any changes in Israeli government behavior. Its significance lies in its highlighting the ugly realities of the Israeli occupation, and also in fostering serious debate about  Israel and Palestine  in the United States. It has broken the pro- Israel stranglehold on public discussion of the behavior and the rights of both Israelis and Palestinians according to a single, universal standard of conduct. </p><p>This vote is the culmination of nearly a decade of open discussion within the  Presbyterian Church on how the moral foundations of the church should shape its actions in society, especially in situations of conflict, occupation and man-made suffering. Pro-Israeli groups have vehemently opposed the divestment decision and the debate that took place around it in recent years. I watched this process from up close two years ago when I was invited by the church to speak in favor of the divestment motion. I was shocked by the scare tactics, frequent lies and ferocity of the pro-Israeli advocates, both Jewish and Christian. These same groups are now working to discredit the church’s decision, by claiming that the vote is virtually anti-Semitic, targets all Jews, aims to harm Jews and Israel, seeks to achieve a Middle East free of Jews, and other such accusations. </p><p>Some of the critics of the church have resorted to intimidation and blackmail aiming to frighten pro-divestment voters, by raising the specter of anti-Semitism. This is an effort to perpetuate the prevailing mood in the  United States that minimizes any serious public discussion of the moral, political and human consequences of the Israeli occupation of Palestinian lands since 1967, and blocks any meaningful political acts that show displeasure with Israel’s behavior. </p><p>The church decision is important, therefore, because it shatters this unhealthy situation, in several ways. First, it sustains an open, honest and heartfelt debate about the situation in  Israel and  Palestine over the past decade, both at the local community level and nationally, with pro- and anti-divestment voices offering their views.</p><p>Second, it has seen pro-divestment sentiment grow steadily among church members, especially among younger ones, indicating that the scare-mongering of the pro- Israel extremists has consistently failed to achieve its goal.</p><p>Third, it has articulated an active link between the moral foundations and purpose of the church and its actions around the world, offering a guide for its members and interested others to study if they wish.</p><p>Fourth, it has smashed the barriers that always made it impossible for mainstream American organizations to take practical political action to show displeasure with Israel’s cruel, colonial and criminal actions in the occupied territories.</p><p>And fifth, it has decisively made it clear that its divestment from companies that profit from the Israeli occupation is about the wrongs of the Israeli occupation – not about  Israel or Jews, for whom the church has deep respect and affinity. </p><p>One of the important reasons the divestment motion passed is because the church put it in a wider context of supporting the rights of Israelis and Palestinians to live in peace and security in adjacent states. The divestment resolution also reaffirmed Israel’s right to exist as a sovereign nation within secure and internationally recognized borders, alongside a free, viable and secure Palestinian state. The church reaffirmed its commitment to interfaith dialogue and partnerships with Jews, Muslims and Christians as central to local churches’ work, and urged “all church institutions to give careful consideration to possible investments in Israel- Palestine that advance peace and improve the lives of Palestinians and Israelis.”</p><p>This is a rare public show in the  United States of equitable action in a manner that is anchored in moral imperatives of faith, while also aiming to meet the best interests of both communities in  Palestine and Israel. The process has gone on for the past decade, and deserves to be better understood because it offers an example of equitable, sustained action – like the anti-apartheid sanctions in South Africa – that could one day lead to a fruitful outcome for all concerned. </p><p>Rami G.

I had just written an obituary of Lebanese historian Kamal Salibi, and Fouad send me a note saying: “Do me a favor please, after 24 years and don’t ask me what the number means, I would love for you to write an obit of me!”</p><p>I’m not sure whether Fouad was ill at the time, but it’s difficult to understand his message as anything but a witty reference to the cancer that carried him away this week. I had graduated 24 years earlier from Johns Hopkins, where Fouad was my professor, yet had foolishly failed to grasp his meaning. Now I may, and I find myself writing what I insisted at the time I hoped never to write. </p><p>I first met Fouad in September 1985 after arriving at Johns Hopkins. I wasn’t sure what to make of this spirited man who, once he knew I had just come from Lebanon, began talking about the mobilization there of the Shiite community, before handing me a copy of an article he had recently written on the topic for Foreign Affairs titled “Lebanon  and Its Inheritors.”</p><p>In those two years I would become Fouad’s friend and for a time serve as his graduate assistant, a task that required me to do only two things: Find the age of the Lebanese Forces leader Samir Geagea and go to the National Archives  and copy all American diplomatic correspondence pertaining to Antoun Saadeh, the founder of the Syrian Social Nationalist Party.</p><p>Ajami’s singular gift was to add narrative texture to his observations of the Middle East. There was a literary bent to the man that gave a sweeping quality to his writings. Some disliked this, saying it allowed for no nuance. Yet rare are the writers on the region, among them Edward Said, a man revered by Ajami’s detractors, who caught the region’s impulses as subtly and brilliantly as he did, against a backdrop of larger historical forces. </p><p>The most notable example was Ajami’s early recognition of the significance of the Shiite revival. In this regard his biography in 1985 of Lebanon’s Musa Sadr, titled “The Vanished Imam,” was ahead of its time, showing what would become an Ajami paradox: his exhilaration with the phenomenon of Shiite affirmation alongside misgivings about specific Shiite political actors such as Hezbollah or Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki. </p><p>However, it was Ajami’s views of America  that would come to define him more than anything else. His adversaries would lazily brand him a “neocon.” But what really mattered to Fouad was not American power per se, but the fact that it might be used to transform the Middle East democratically. That may have been too idealistic by half, but it was born of his deep frustration with an Arab world that, for most of the time he had studied it, could not break free from suffocating authoritarianism and sterility. </p><p>I believe this view of  America was at the heart of his rift with Said, like him an Arab immigrant who had gained prominence in the country. Ajami could never quite stomach someone who had earned recognition thanks to his life in New York, only to build on this through perpetual condemnation of  America and its role in the Arab world. Where Said reaffirmed his Palestinianness at every occasion, Ajami invariably spoke of himself as an American, even if he never rejected his Lebanese identity and retained until the end a complicated relationship with his birthplace.</p><p>All of Ajami’s books were in most ways outstanding, but his admirers will perhaps remember “The Dream Palace of the Arabs” with the greatest intensity. As the subtitle suggests, the book is about an Arab generation’s odyssey, one that ended in failure and disappointment – the generation that came of age in the 1950s, weaned on Arab nationalism and hope that the region could be transformed for the better as a consequence. Yet Ajami began his book with an account of the suicide of the Lebanese poet Khalil Hawi  in 1982 in reaction to Israel’s invasion of his country. For him Hawi’s act of desperation was a requiem for that generation, exemplifying the shattering of Arab expectations. </p><p>This had particular resonance for me, as I had been in Beirut at the time of Hawi’s suicide. While I felt no great sympathy for Arab nationalism, having spent years watching  Lebanon laid waste almost as much by inter-Arab mendacity and rivalries as by the destructiveness of its own people, Ajami’s narrative of defeat only reflected accurately what I and others had seen all around us. As a chronicler of this desolate reality, Ajami had few peers. </p><p>Not surprisingly, Fouad’s last book was on Syria. By that time the  America he knew had changed, its president and people willing to witness the Syrian carnage without flinching. “In reckoning with the evils of the Syrian regime, American power was either naive or willfully indifferent,” he wrote last February. It must not have been easy for Fouad to hear moral censure of the supporters of the Iraq War by Americans who had no moral compunction about allowing the slaughter in Syria to continue unabated.</p><p>You wonder what Fouad felt at the end about the country he had embraced so completely. His articles became more caustic, his condemnation of President Barack Obama’s inaction sharper. Fouad’s Arab solidarity seemed to be reimposing itself as dominant against an elusive  America he had romanticized, one distancing itself decisively from the world he knew best. Perhaps his odyssey, too, ended at a roadblock of disenchantment. </p><p>Michael Young is opinion editor of THE DAILY STAR.

Today, everyone in Lebanon is asking the same question: Is ISIS coming here after conquering so much of Iraq? Are we going to see militants waving black flags coming through the borders to take over Lebanon?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The answers to these questions are not a simple yes or no. &ldquo;ISIS&rdquo; today is a vague enough term that it could be applied to any Sunni militant entity choosing extremism and violence to fight their enemies, i.e. Maliki, Assad, Iran, or Hezbollah. The phenomenon of &ldquo;ISIS&rdquo; has gradually developed in the region as the influence of moderate Islam has declined. In this sense, ISIS will not &ldquo;come to Lebanon:&rdquo; ISIS is already here, and it has emerged slowly but surely since the events of May 7, 2008, continuing through the Sheikh Ahmad al-Assir movement in Sidon, and escalating to today&rsquo;s suicide bombers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The promise of power</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>ISIS&rsquo; increased regional strength did not come from nowhere. In the 1980s, Hezbollah was empowered through a feeling of injustice within the Shiite community. After Lebanon gained independence in 1943, Shiites found themselves politically underrepresented and economically very poor compared to other sects in Lebanon. Decades of marginalization and poverty gave Lebanese Shiites less cause to trust the state and more reason to bank on groups like Hezbollah, which at least came with the promise of resistance and political power.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As years of civil war, Syrian hegemony, Israeli occupation, rampant corruption, and illegitimate weapons bled authority from the Lebanese state, Hezbollah came to look like the only protector of Lebanese Shiites, despite increasing criticism &ndash; by the Shiites themselves &ndash; of its corruption and its involvement in Syria. But that wasn&rsquo;t enough for Hezbollah. It ignored Sunni resentment and consistently acted as if its power were eternally sacred.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Today, ISIS has become empowered by a similar feeling of injustice within the Sunni community, and what we are seeing is the emergence of what can be described as a Sunni Hezbollah.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This feeling of injustice has grown within the Sunni majority as Shiites and Alawites &ndash; Iran&rsquo;s proxies &ndash; rose to power in Syria after 1970, Iraq after 2005, and Lebanon also after 2005, all with the international community&rsquo;s blessing. So we shouldn&rsquo;t be surprised that &ldquo;ISIS&rdquo; happened: injustice creates extremism and an inclination toward violent revenge.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The majority of Sunnis in the region are neither part nor fans of ISIS, but the group is extending the same promise as the one Hezbollah offered in the 80s: resistance and political power. Resistance to the Iranian hegemony in the region, and the reclamation of power for the Sunnis in Iraq, Syria, and Lebanon. These promises, if not necessarily the accompanying ideology, will appeal to the people.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Shiite extremism vs. Sunni extremism </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Extremism is not limited to an ethnic or religious group in the Arab and Muslim world. These ideas and beliefs exist everywhere, in each dictatorship and autocratic regime. Any group or leadership that refuses to acknowledge state authority, practices violence to impose its own rules, and denies the freedom of the individual and their basic right to freedom, equality, and citizenship, is not that different from ISIS. Hezbollah is no exception: all Parties of God that use religion and ideology to force themselves on other citizens are &ldquo;ISIS.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Hezbollah refuses to acknowledge the Lebanese state&rsquo;s authority and refuses to surrender its arms, which have killed innocent Lebanese civilians, to the Lebanese State. Hezbollah committed violence on May 7, 2008 against fellow Lebanese, killed Hashem al-Salman in 2013, and is still murdering &ndash; or at least is complicit in murdering &ndash; thousands of innocent Syrian civilians across the border. Hezbollah denies individual freedom in its own areas: good luck buying or drinking alcohol in the South or the Beqaa. Hezbollah does not accept democracy: they have toppled two governments since 2005 (Siniora and Hariri&rsquo;s), the only two governments that resulted from the March 14 victory in the parliamentary elections.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Hezbollah, like ISIS, are foreign fighters participating in the Syrian war; indeed, they came to Syria even before ISIS was formed. And the Party further promises its martyrs the same heaven ISIS guarantees to theirs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So how is Hezbollah really different from ISIS? Is it because they do not film their crimes and broadcast them on YouTube? Or is because they prefer to kill from a distance instead of beheading people?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Extremist groups feed on each other in order to grow and justify their existence. Today, ISIS is not as organized as Hezbollah, and it certainly does not have a recognizable sponsoring state like Iran. But this could be just the beginning. ISIS now has land, money, and revenues, and eventually could become more regimented.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A Sunni Hezbollah in conflict with a Shiite Hezbollah is bad news. A regional sectarian war between Sunnis and the Shiites, spearheaded by ISIS and Hezbollah, will only lead to more bloodshed and extremism that will spread to other states in the region. Moderate Islam will become history and no one will be safe from the consequences, not even western states.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As Iraqi Shiite groups return to Iraq to fight against ISIS, Hezbollah will have to fill the vacuum in Syria. This means more involvement in the war, but it also means spreading itself increasingly thin in terms of its military and logistical capabilities. The crisis in Iraq moreover makes it harder for Maliki to continue funding Iranian and Hezbollah operations in Syria, meaning even more hardship for the Party.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>At the same time, ISIS appears to be bringing in arsenals seized in Mosul into Syria, mainly to Deir el-Zor and Hasaka. The result is that ISIS will probably take over more areas currently under FSA or Jabhat al-Nusra control.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Ultimately, this means ISIS and Hezbollah will clash in Syria and spark heightened sectarian violence in Lebanon &ndash; not merely through suicide bombings and explosions, but probably through a new civil war, this time between Sunnis and Shiites.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It is likely already too late to stop this.

The company, presumably driven by a mixture of its own daring ambitions and the resurgent construction business in the United Arab Emirates and other Gulf countries, had seen its share price double in roughly two months between mid-January and mid-April. The share opened above AED 5 ($1.36) on April 20 and rallied another 47 percent to AED 7.40 on May 14, its highest close ever.</p>
<p>Amid a wave of surprising news, however, the Arabtec share price fell just as precipitously in the five weeks since and closed last week at AED 4.26 — levels last seen in early April. What makes this slide stand out was that the company started to dominate the trading activity on the DFM with high volumes of share sales around June 8, ahead of a series of surprising disclosures. On June 11, the company posted a press release among its official company disclosures on the DFM, in which chief executive Hasan Ismaik dismissed “rumors” about the company’s share price in the two preceding days as well as rumors about its future plans, without refuting any allegation or even specifying what either rumor might be.</p>
<p>On June 12, the company added another disclosure — posted only in Arabic — denying that it planned any new listing of a unit on the DFM and on June 15, it announced a board meeting for June 18 to discuss projects and “other business.” In the meanwhile, the selloff of Arabtec shares continued as the market was treated to news that Ismaik had expanded his personally held stake from 8 percent earlier in the year to 21.5 percent by late May and then to almost 29 percent by June 15.</p>
<p>At the same time, the largest institutional investor in Arabtec, a unit of Abu Dhabi state owned International Petroleum Investment Company (IPIC) that goes by the name of Aabar Investments, caused nervousness among investors by reducing its stake in Arabtec to around 19 percent from 21.6 percent in share sales between June 8 and 10. Subsequent news that Aabar had divested of another 4.6 percent were based on information on the DFM website that the market operator described on June 15 as “temporary system glitch” in the last trading hour.</p>
<p>All this was topped on June 19, however, when Arabtec announced the results of its June 18 board meeting, revealing that the “other business” discussed by the board constituted the resignation of the company’s CEO and since quite recently, largest shareholder, Ismaik. The stock predictably tanked again when this bombshell hit. By time of this writing on June 23, Bloomberg and Reuters news services cited “sources” saying that a key executive and an unspecified number of employees had been dismissed.</p>
<p>However, there was no DFM market statement by Arabtec to this extent and the corporate website only reflected the revision of board membership announced in the June 19 DFM disclosure. The website also did not any provide information on the Arabtec viewpoint of the developments since the beginning of June. However, those looking for insights into the company’s business approach could gain incisive flashes of enlightenment on what Arabtec (or its public relations writers) called “our commitment.”</p>
<p>“Arabtec Holding is a Publicly Listed Company and therefore we must be publicly open and transparent,” the page explained. The company claims to be bursting with integrity and ethical behavior via a code of conduct for executive on all levels. It also affirms that disclosure of “all material matters concerning the company’s activities should be timely and balanced”. However, the most recent minutes of a board meeting that can be accessed on the site date from August 7, 2012 and the most recent disclosure shown is dated July 7, 2013.</p>
<p><strong>Markets down</strong></p>
<p>Led by Arabtec’s continued slide — and with the holy month of Ramadan fast approaching — index readings and trading activities across Arab securities markets retreated in the year’s 25th week. Meanwhile, the top indices in the United States were shooting up to new records as the Federal Reserve was reassuring investors about the strength of and outlook for the American economy.</p>
<p>The region’s major markets fell noticeably in what was plainly one of the year’s most underperforming weeks for Arab equities. Benchmark indices for the Qatari, Kuwaiti, Egyptian and Dubai bourses dropped between 4 and 5 percent. Markets in Amman, Casablanca, Manama, Riyadh and Abu Dhabi lost between 1 and 3 percent. Muscat and Beirut could hardly be called gainers as each advanced by less than a tenth of a percent. A small green arrow signaling a one percent gain in the Tunindex was the best that the MENA had to offer.</p>

Jim Yong Kim, head of the World Bank, who was in Beirut earlier this month, already gave us the bad news, so we knew our chances of a bumper tourist season were about as remote as Iran beating Argentina in the group stages of the Fifa World Cup. And yet, like Saturday night&#x2019;s game, it looked like an upset was on the cards.</p><p>You see, according to Mr Kim &#x2013; but it&#x2019;s really no secret &#x2013; the Syrian civil war will have cost Lebanon US$7.5 billion: that&#x2019;s roughly 18 per cent of GDP, by the end of the year. Meanwhile, GDP has dropped by 2.9 per cent each year since 2012 and unemployment has rocketed to above 20 per cent. Mr Kim also likened the influx of Syrian refugees fleeing the conflict to the whole of Mexico moving to, and working in, the US.</p><p>Even so, on Wednesday night the bars and restaurants on Zaytouni Bay, the waterfront development near the husk of the old Hotel St Georges, were doing brisk trade.</p><p>My niece and her admittedly jittery Irish husband were over from London for a wedding and, apart from being a little taken aback at being charged $15 for a five-minute cab ride, were having the time of their lives.</p><p>Even the tourism minister Michel Pharaon, whom I must confess, despite my initial scepticism, is making a decent fist of his new job, told the Arab Economic Forum in Beirut on Friday that hotel bookings for the summer had increased by 15 per cent on 2013. Not bad when you remember Mr Kim&#x2019;s bleak prognosis.</p><p>And then came a late goal to break Lebanese hearts. A car bomb at the mountain pass into the Bekaa Valley and a series of raids on hotels in the Hamra district of West Beirut that closed all the roads to the capital and which, looking back, seemed nothing more than a lot of sound and fury signifying nothing, sent us into a tailspin. </p><p>Within hours, events scheduled for the weekend were cancelled or postponed and a UAE diplomat urged his citizens to leave Lebanon. It doesn&#x2019;t take much for people to err on the side of caution, especially with Iraq all over the news. Beirut may be 740 kilometres from Mosul, but as far as the rest of the world is concerned we&#x2019;re all part of the same mess.</p><p>Well at least we still have the football, and the World Cup is a good opportunity to be reminded of countries to which we wouldn&#x2019;t normally give a second thought. Take Costa Rica, the nation that is, much to everyone&#x2019;s surprise, riding high in the group stages of the tournament. The Central American nation and Lebanon are quite similar. Both are what the World Bank calls upper-middle income countries. Costa Rica has a population of 4.5 million people and a GDP of $45bn. Close enough.</p><p>But Costa Rica has created genuine opportunities for foreign investment where Lebanon hasn&#x2019;t, especially in software development and pharmaceuticals, and has a solid financial services sector that does more than hold deposits and lend to the government. It also has a thriving eco-tourism sector, thanks to one of the best environmental policies in the world, while Lebanon, if we are being honest, is an eco-nightmare.</p><p>I would like to think that there is a link between a being small nation, having a sound environmental programme and the ability to punch above your weight on the greatest stage in world football and I will wager that even if Costa Rica does not progress very far in the knockout stages, the world will have already seen it in a new, more exciting, and perhaps even more prosperous, light.</p><p>As for Lebanese football, well last year,  more than 24 Lebanese footballers were investigated for match fixing and &#x201c;throwing&#x201d; games at the behest of international gambling cartels. That about sums us up, for now.</p><p>But just imagine Lebanon in the World Cup finals. Now that would be a party not even ISIS could stop.</p><p>Michael Karam is a freelance journalist based in Beirut </p><p></p><p>Follow us on Twitter @Ind_Insights</p>";s:17:"post_image_height";i:0;s:16:"post_image_width";i:0;s:11:"post_visits";i:8;s:18:"post_twitterShares";i:0;s:19:"post_facebookShares";i:0;s:16:"post_totalShares";i:0;s:16:"post_socialScore";i:9;s:13:"post_virality";i:2;s:9:"blog_name";N;s:16:"blog_description";N;s:8:"blog_url";N;s:11:"blog_author";N;s:28:"blog_author_twitter_username";N;s:13:"blog_rss_feed";N;s:9:"blog_tags";N;s:2:"id";N;s:11:"blog_active";N;s:24:"blog_last_post_timestamp";N;s:6:"col_id";i:6;s:8:"col_name";s:29:"Michael Karam at The National";s:16:"col_media_source";s:12:"The National";s:13:"col_home_page";s:109:"http://www.thenational.ae/apps/pbcs.dll/search?q=*&NavigatorFilter=[Byline:Michael%20Karam]&BuildNavigators=1";s:13:"col_shorthand";s:8:"mkaramtn";s:26:"col_media_source_shorthand";s:12:"the_national";s:27:"col_author_twitter_username";s:15:"Lebanesewineman";s:8:"col_tags";s:20:"columnists, politics";s:15:"col_description";s:40:"Michael Karam is a writer and journalist";s:23:"col_last_post_timestamp";i:1404727872;}i:11;O:8:"stdClass":36:{s:7:"post_id";i:31725;s:8:"post_url";s:133:"http://www.thenational.ae/business/industry-insights/the-life/lebanons-massive-own-goal-in-attempt-to-secure-tv-coverage-of-world-cup";s:10:"post_title";s:72:"Lebanon's massive own goal in attempt to secure TV coverage of World Cup";s:10:"post_image";N;s:12:"post_excerpt";s:177:"The latest example of Lebanon's escalating mediocrity must surely be its failure to secure local coverage of the World Cup, surely the most popular sporting tournament on Earth.";s:7:"blog_id";N;s:14:"post_timestamp";i:1403449793;s:12:"post_content";s:4553:"<p>The latest example of Lebanon’s escalating mediocrity must surely be the state’s failure to secure terrestrial coverage of the Fifa World Cup in time for the opening game. For weeks, the government had been trying to convince us that it was close to agreeing a deal with Qatar’s Al Jazeera that would give TeleLiban, Lebanon’s all but forgotten and woefully underfunded state channel, the broadcast rights free of charge.</p><p>“The deal is now in its final stages,” Abdul-Muttaleb Al Hinawi, Lebanon’s minister for youth and sport, breathlessly told local media over the weekend. “We have intensified contacts with Qatari officials and we should get approval as soon as possible. The entire government is working to make this happen.”</p><p>That flabbergasting last sentence prompted one wag on social media to wonder what should concern him more – that we should be worried that government has abandoned other more pressing issues to ensure we can all watch football or that even with a collective effort it has failed so far to achieve even this.</p><p>Either way, the realisation on Thursday night that we couldn’t watch the games on local TV prompted a frantic nationwide trawl through the 300 or so mostly useless satellite channels most of us get from illegal cable providers to find at least one that was showing the game.</p><p>The French TFI showed the opening ceremony and about 30 minutes of the match between Brazil and Croatia before it cut out. Those who had access to Sky Sports in Italian were in luck, but the rest of the country sat fuming in front of a frozen goalmouth scramble.</p><p>In the meantime, the local satellite provider Sama, which has the rights from Al Jazeera to broadcast the games on satellite networks, is charging anywhere between US$110 and $400 for a special World Cup package. So the Lebanese were faced with having to stump up or go out to a bar or cafe, which would probably cost the same, if not more, in the long run.</p><p>Then at 11.30am yesterday, Boutros Harb, Lebanon’s telecommunications minister, announced that US$3 million in revenues from the state-run mobile phone sector would be used to pay Sama for the World Cup rights.</p><p>Good news all round, but the government should have been more decisive. Instead of going cap in hand to the Qataris, why didn’t it just buy the rights the usual way and use the World Cup as a platform to relaunch the fortunes of TeleLiban? It would certainly be the most watched channel in the country during the tournament, and any advertising revenues could be ploughed back into buying better programming in the future. Lebanon needs a functioning and credible state TV channel.</p><p>In other news, in a document entitled “Up and Coming Cities For the Rich” Beirut beat off Cape Town, Chennai, Chicago, Dublin, Istanbul, Jakarta and Lagos to come top.</p><p>Why? Because Beirut real estate is apparently still packed with opportunities for the savvy investor. According to the report, a two-bedroom apartment in the city can be picked up for between US$180,000 and $500,000. Yeah right. Eight years ago maybe.</p><p>A new, “small” 170 square metre two-bedroom flat in the “up and coming”, but still decidedly edgy, Mar Mikhael district will set you back $750,000. Move into the centre of town and you are nudging $1 million for new build.</p><p>Add in registration fees and the flat will come in at a tad over $800,000 ,which means that a landlord would have to achieve $40,000 a year to get a 5 per cent return on his investment. Given that supply in Beirut easily outstrips demand, a factor apparently ignored by the report, it would surely be better to put your money in lira at 6 per cent. At least you get your hands on your capital at any time; property is not as liquid as it is in Europe and secondary market activity is sluggish, again something the report’s authors overlooked.</p><p>And then there is Beirut itself. “It’s a jungle out there,” said my banker friend, whose World Cup anguish was eclipsed by an incident in front of his building, where “valets”, who live by parking cars for shoppers and visitors to the area, have expropriated his parking spot by installing a removable concrete bollard. “And you complain that they are trying to rip us off over the football? It’s madness. We live in a mafia society.”</p><p>I can’t be sure, but I doubt the report mentioned that either.</p><p>Michael Karam is a freelance writer based in Beirut </p><p>Follow us on Twitter @Ind_Insights</p>";s:17:"post_image_height";i:0;s:16:"post_image_width";i:0;s:11:"post_visits";i:9;s:18:"post_twitterShares";i:0;s:19:"post_facebookShares";i:0;s:16:"post_totalShares";i:0;s:16:"post_socialScore";i:10;s:13:"post_virality";i:2;s:9:"blog_name";N;s:16:"blog_description";N;s:8:"blog_url";N;s:11:"blog_author";N;s:28:"blog_author_twitter_username";N;s:13:"blog_rss_feed";N;s:9:"blog_tags";N;s:2:"id";N;s:11:"blog_active";N;s:24:"blog_last_post_timestamp";N;s:6:"col_id";i:6;s:8:"col_name";s:29:"Michael Karam at The National";s:16:"col_media_source";s:12:"The National";s:13:"col_home_page";s:109:"http://www.thenational.ae/apps/pbcs.dll/search?q=*&NavigatorFilter=[Byline:Michael%20Karam]&BuildNavigators=1";s:13:"col_shorthand";s:8:"mkaramtn";s:26:"col_media_source_shorthand";s:12:"the_national";s:27:"col_author_twitter_username";s:15:"Lebanesewineman";s:8:"col_tags";s:20:"columnists, politics";s:15:"col_description";s:40:"Michael Karam is a writer and journalist";s:23:"col_last_post_timestamp";i:1404727872;}i:12;O:8:"stdClass":36:{s:7:"post_id";i:31690;s:8:"post_url";s:93:"http://english.al-akhbar.com//content/green-light-given-suicide-bombing-fest%E2%80%9D-lebanon";s:10:"post_title";s:58:"Green light given to “suicide-bombing fest” in Lebanon";s:10:"post_image";s:97:"http://english.al-akhbar.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/5cols/leading_images/177316-01-08.jpg";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:149:"For 20 years, Hezbollah has been obliged to pay the price twice.

The first being the price required to achieve its successes, and the second being the price that its enemies and opponents want to force it to pay for having achieved these successes. </p><p>After what happened in Syria over the past four months, many governments, intelligence services, and terrorist cells alike realized that the confrontation with Hezbollah is difficult and complex. </p><p>Hezbollah succeeded in not only discovering and tracking down a large number of terrorists involved in attacks against its base, and in Lebanon and Syria, but the party also showed unprecedented perseverance in hunting down those terrorists wherever they may be, in Lebanon or Syria, in the areas under its influence and those of its allies, and beyond. This was no laughing matter for Hezbollah, though its intelligence abilities may only be verified by way of the results they have achieved. </p><p>Practically speaking, Hezbollah was able to destroy the main logistical bases of the suicide bombers in Syria and along the border with Lebanon. Hezbollah dealt direct and fatal blows to the majority of individuals involved in terror attacks, both in the planning and execution thereof. In collaboration with security services in Lebanon, Syria, and elsewhere, Hezbollah was able to dismantle many cells that could have done a lot more damage. </p><p>True, the terrorists have been greatly weakened as a result. But Hezbollah, neither on the battlefield nor in its strongholds, has taken any practical action to suggest it is reassured by the results. Hezbollah judged that it has weakened the “lunatics” to a large extent, but the party knows their true makeup well, and it has information indicating these groups remain active and are attempting to regroup, and to gather enough support to resume their terrorist activities. </p><p>The bid to weaken the Iran-Iraq-Syria-Hezbollah axis is now obligated to go through al-Qaeda and its offshoots.  It is not logical to say that there is a full complementarity between al-Qaeda offshoots and the governments of Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Turkey. But there is a great deal of overlap, centering on the fact that these countries, in addition to the Western powers and Israel, believe that only al-Qaeda and its offshoots can stand their ground in the battlefield, especially following the series of unprecedented scandals surrounding all other armed gangs that have been described as “moderate.” In other words, the bid to weaken the Iran-Iraq-Syria-Hezbollah axis is now obligated to go through al-Qaeda and its offshoots.</p><p>Everyone is acting on the basis that the terrorism that swept through Iraq recently, which has wrested entire areas out of the control of the Iraqi state, can restore equilibrium following the series of defeats in Syria and then Lebanon. </p><p>While the state of euphoria that has possessed the governments involved in supporting this brand of terrorism remains confined to the political gains they seek in Iraq and Syria, the euphoria that emerged among the supporters of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) has far exceeded these governments’ calculations. Indeed, the novel situation has prompted a considerable number of terrorist groups to restart their engines, either to emulate or complement ISIS’ feats, or appear as though they have the ability to match ISIS – something that is mostly visible among the groups affiliated to al-Nusra Front and the Abdullah Azzam Brigades. </p><p>These groups are interlinked, and have a central “prime mover” in our region. Meanwhile, there have been major political developments following the recent election in Syria, which granted President Bashar al-Assad a large popular base; the parliamentary election in Iraq, which reinforced Nouri al-Maliki’s position in power, and the failure of the bid to extend Michel Suleiman’s term in Lebanon. All this was expected to lead to a readjustment in the strategy of the rival camp. </p><p>It is in this context that the recent events in Iraq played out, and also the attempts to heat things up in the Syrian front to achieve a major coup in Aleppo or the south. Similarly, a decision was made to re-ignite the Lebanese arena, to put pressure on Hezbollah toward making political concessions – as related to the presidency and the government – in exchange for security, and push its back to the wall to prevent it from playing any role in Iraq similar to the role is has been playing in Syria.</p><p>A decision was made to re-ignite the Lebanese arena, to put pressure on Hezbollah toward making political concessions... in exchange for security. It is in this climate that all alarm bells went off at once in the corridors of the security services in Lebanon. First, the Intelligence Directorate of the Lebanese army received cryptic tips from the United States about groups having arrived in Lebanon to carry out attacks against healthcare facilities. It was the view of some analysts that this meant attacks on hospitals in Beirut’s southern suburbs where wounded Hezbollah fighters are being treated.</p><p>Then there were tips from European capitals, relayed to the Information Branch of the Internal Security Forces, about the arrival of cells comprising Saudi nationals into Lebanon to carry out attacks on Shias in particular. There was also information about a sudden surge in the activity of groups affiliated to the armed Syrian opposition in the Bekaa Valley, including in the town of Arsal, where al-Nusra Front has reportedly regrouped despite the security measures taken by the Lebanese government.</p><p>All these warnings indicate that a green light has been given to reignite the Lebanese arena. The goal: to undo the achievements of the Resistance in Syria though a “suicide-bombing fest” in Beirut and its suburbs, as one well-placed source puts it. </p><p>It will take time to fully understand what happened on Friday. There is no evidence that attacks were about to be carried out in Beirut nor is there overwhelming evidence that Abbas Ibrahim was the target of the suicide attack in Dahr al-Baidar, and the same goes for the rumors about a Mossad document and a journalist from a Lebanese origin who warned about Ibrahim’s assassination. Similar theories have been circulating on social media, and it seems that some have a very vivid imagination regarding events that never materialized.</p><p>But what is certain is that there are some parties trying to push Lebanon toward a return to the tension that prevailed before the battles in Qalamoun were settled. There are worrying signs from the northern regions, where those who were hurt by the government’s security plan might be seeking to bring back chaos. There is also an attempt to blackmail Hezbollah and its allies on many political and security-related issues, and all that this camp can do in the meantime is be more patient.</p><p>Ibrahim al-Amin is the editor-in-chief of Al-Akhbar.</p><p>This article is an edited translation from the Arabic Edition.</p>";s:17:"post_image_height";i:509;s:16:"post_image_width";i:780;s:11:"post_visits";i:0;s:18:"post_twitterShares";i:0;s:19:"post_facebookShares";i:21;s:16:"post_totalShares";i:21;s:16:"post_socialScore";i:12;s:13:"post_virality";i:24;s:9:"blog_name";N;s:16:"blog_description";N;s:8:"blog_url";N;s:11:"blog_author";N;s:28:"blog_author_twitter_username";N;s:13:"blog_rss_feed";N;s:9:"blog_tags";N;s:2:"id";N;s:11:"blog_active";N;s:24:"blog_last_post_timestamp";N;s:6:"col_id";i:5;s:8:"col_name";s:36:"Ibrahim al-Amin at Al-Akhbar English";s:16:"col_media_source";s:17:"Al-Akhbar English";s:13:"col_home_page";s:37:"http://english.al-akhbar.com/node/125";s:13:"col_shorthand";s:8:"iaminakh";s:26:"col_media_source_shorthand";s:9:"al_akhbar";s:27:"col_author_twitter_username";N;s:8:"col_tags";s:20:"columnists, politics";s:15:"col_description";s:51:"Ibrahim al-Amin is the Editor in Chief of Al-Akhbar";s:23:"col_last_post_timestamp";i:1403780933;}i:13;O:8:"stdClass":36:{s:7:"post_id";i:31668;s:8:"post_url";s:103:"http://dailystar.com.lb/Opinion/Columnist/2014/Jun-21/260957-what-obama-didnt-say-about-iraqs-mess.ashx";s:10:"post_title";s:43:"What Obama didn’t say about Iraq’s mess";s:10:"post_image";N;s:12:"post_excerpt";s:302:"President Barack Obama’s decision to help the Iraqi armed forces contain or defeat the Islamic State in Iraq and Greater Syria (ISIS) by sending 300 military advisers and offering intelligence, equipment and other support is fully in keeping with the confused American response to the situation in...";s:7:"blog_id";N;s:14:"post_timestamp";i:1403301978;s:12:"post_content";s:4772:"<p>President Barack Obama’s decision to help the Iraqi armed forces contain or defeat the Islamic State in Iraq  and Greater Syria (ISIS) by sending 300 military advisers and offering intelligence, equipment and other support is fully in keeping with the confused American response to the situation in the Middle East. I give him an “A” for consistency, and a “D” for efficacy.</p><p>The painful irony of Obama’s speech Thursday night was that everything he said was sensible: ISIS must be contained and defeated; the U.S. military cannot solve Iraq’s problems;  Iraq needs an inclusive government and a credible democracy; and regional powers must be involved in a diplomatic process to bring peace to Iraq. Yet the problem that he and Americans refuse to acknowledge is that actual American policies on the ground have led to the precise opposite of these truths: American military and political conduct created the conditions in  Iraq for ISIS to emerge, allowed the Iraqis to fragment under American rule and bypass serious pluralistic power-sharing, and stunted any regional diplomacy by refusing to deal seriously with Iran.</p><p>American policies in the Middle East  reflect confusion and some dishonesty at three levels, leaving Obama’s sensible rhetoric and analysis largely invalidated by the impact of American actions.</p><p>First, logistically the United States  is stuck between not wanting to return its troops to combat (a good decision) and trying to play a role in preventing the spread of ISIS. Washington  is trying to respond to both imperatives, which is impossible to do. It is also hard to see how 300 advisers can make a major difference in the wake of the Americans’ spending large sums of money over the last decade training and equipping the Iraqi armed forces. Even this limited level of American support for the Iraqi government will make the U.S. appear to be siding with Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki in the domestic strife in Iraq, which will make Americans targets for revenge attacks. </p><p>This is a sad replay of the U.S. policies in Vietnam in the early 1960s, or in Lebanon in the early 1980s, both of which proved to be disastrous military interventions. Americans have not learned that since the days of Greece and Rome, foreign armies in the  Middle East can prevail for a few years, but they always depart and leave behind them mayhem and great levels of destruction that their presence helped to foment. </p><p>Second, Obama continues the prevalent trend in American politics of totally ignoring that the U.S. invasion of  Iraq in 2003 was the single most important factor in unleashing the forces of violence and sectarianism in Iraq. He speaks of  Iraq as if it were some isolated island untouched by American foreign policy, but that has suddenly suffered from sectarian warfare and fractious politics that emerged from a vacuum. Refusing to admit the failure of American policy in the period 2003-11 means the U.S. and others will repeat those same failures.</p><p>Obama correctly noted the centrality of promoting inclusive governance in  Iraq as the long-term solution to the problems and threats at hand. Yet he refuses to acknowledge that when the U.S. had immense, even controlling, influence inside  Iraq in the 2003-11 period it failed to achieve this end, and left behind a wrecked and scarred landscape defined by government incompetence, criminality, corruption and polarization.</p><p>Third, Obama’s comments on Iran  are truly offensive. He resorts to his hallmark “audacity” in saying that  Iran can be part of the regional diplomatic action needed to bring calm to  Iraq if  Iran plays a constructive role in Iraq. There is zero credibility in such statements coming from the president of a country whose war on  Iraq probably created the most destruction there since the Mongol invasion and sacking of Baghdad in 1258. If there were a global award for willful and criminal destruction of a sovereign state by a foreign power, the U.S. and the United Kingdom would have to share that prize for their policies in Iraq. </p><p>Obama’s disdainful treatment of  Iran reflects, however, a pattern of American attitudes that the U.S. can do anything around the world and not be held accountable for the death and destruction it causes, while smaller and darker states in the South must conform to behavioral norms set in  Washington (and sometimes in Tel Aviv, though Israel usually is exempt from adhering to the same norms, as we witness today in the mass arrests, collective punishments and continued arrest and killing of children in Israeli-occupied Palestinian lands).</p><p>Rami G.

It&rsquo;s difficult to say, principally because both countries have very different agendas in the country, even if their shared aim is to contain the offensive of the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>For Iran, fragmentation in Iraq is not only acceptable, but also &ndash; if controlled &ndash; desirable in helping the Islamic Republic impose its hegemony over the country. Tehran has backed Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki through thick and thin, doing nothing to restrain his divisive Shiite-centric policies that have so alienated the Sunni community. It has also persuaded other Shiite leaders, most prominently Muqtada al-Sadr, to go along with Maliki, even when they had no desire to do so.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In parallel, the Iranians have retained influence over Iraq&rsquo;s Kurds. That&rsquo;s understandable, given the border shared by Kurdistan and Iran, and the fact that the Kurds are sandwiched between Turkey and Iran while being caught up in a tense relationship with the rest of Iraq. In this context the Kurds simply cannot afford to alienate their powerful neighbors. Illustrating the ties, even when he was president, Jalal Talabani was said to meet regularly with General Qassem Soleimani, the head of the Quds Force of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>For Iran, enhancing fragmentation is a necessary strategy to assert its power. The Islamic Republic, which is in the midst of expanding its regional influence, would find it much more difficult to control unified Arab countries. With chaos, on the other hand, Iran can make gains amidst division and exploit the political openings provided by perpetual conflict.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>That is precisely the plan Iran has followed in Syria. Tehran has bolstered the regime of President Bashar al-Assad, but only in a strategically important area that includes Damascus, the border with Lebanon, the Syrian coast, and communications lines in between. Outside those areas Iran, both for reasons of necessity and choice, has not helped Assad&rsquo;s army re-conquer territory, effectively helping to harden de facto partition lines in Syria.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>What disturbs the Iranians today in Iraq is not that the state appears to be falling apart. It is that the Sunni uprising risks undermining vital Iranian interests, while simultaneously obstructing the geographic continuity between Iran and Syria and Lebanon. This is particularly important in the event Iran must rearm or supply Hezbollah or the Assad regime.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Unlike Iran, the United States is not after fragmentation in Iraq: it is after integration. Its message to Maliki has been that he better integrate Sunnis into the Iraqi state if he seeks American assistance. Washington has reportedly also asked the Kurds to help the Maliki government regain territory from ISIS, a request the Kurds have reportedly resisted. Iran has asked the same. But where the Americans did so in order to rally Iraq&rsquo;s different communities, seeing the ISIS threat as a potential national unifying factor, Iran seems far more concerned with reversing the broader Sunni challenge, even if that means mobilizing Shiites in a campaign bound to heighten sectarian animosities.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>What would this mean for collaboration between Iran and the United States? The Obama administration has just announced that it would send 300 advisers to Iraq, a relatively minimal response to the situation there. It doesn&rsquo;t want to be used by Maliki and Iran as a weapon against the Sunni community, and even less so does it want to reinforce their position in a way that may damage American interests and those of its regional allies.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But President Barack Obama must still decide what his priority is in Iraq. If it is simply to fight terrorism and its consequences, then he has to answer a simple question posed by a former Obama administration official, Anne-Marie Slaughter, in a New York Times opinion piece this week: &ldquo;Why is the threat of ISIS in Iraq a sufficiently vital interest, but not the rise of ISIS in Syria &ndash; and a hideous civil war that has dismembered Syria itself and destabilized Lebanon, Jordan and now Iraq?&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If it is to bolster the Maliki regime, then Obama must address the argument of another former official, Steven Simon, also writing in the Times. Simon believes that Iran will win in Iraq, and that the Sunni revolt will only isolate the community further. The result is that the &ldquo;rump Iraq&rdquo; controlled by Maliki &ldquo;will be ever more in thrall to Iran, and committed to domestic policies that make the reconstitution of the country via a political process ever more unlikely.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In both cases there are no good choices for America, at a moment when the Obama administration remains deeply reluctant to involve the country in Middle Eastern conflicts.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Simon is correct in seeing Iran as the ultimate beneficiary of American missteps. No doubt the Iranians view collaboration with the Americans as possible leverage in the nuclear file, something that enhances goodwill and can be reflected in a satisfactory outcome to the nuclear talks.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But there would not be much in it for the United States. Maliki is unlikely to open up to the Sunnis, and Iran has no intention of making him do so. American-Iranian cooperation in Iraq would essentially benefit the Islamic Republic. If Obama is unwilling to go all the way and resolve the ISIS headache both in Syria and Iraq, then it&rsquo;s better he do as little as possible. America&rsquo;s short attention span tends only to favor its adversaries.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Michael Young is opinion editor of The Daily Star newspaper.

Yet after World War II the situation changed. By then minority treaties had been scrapped and the victorious powers sanctioned vast population transfers in Eastern Europe. </p><p>The historian Mark Mazower  has written, “Minorities were now seen as sources of destabilization, and liberals and socialists were as passionate in demanding their eradication as fascists ... Ethnic homogeneity &#91;was regarded&#93; as a desirable feature of national self-determination and international stability.”</p><p>Such a tendency now seems evident in the Middle East, where religious pluralism and coexistence are increasingly viewed as unrealistic and threatening. This attitude was kept in check for a long period by Arab nationalism, which imagined an Arab identity transcending religious and sectarian affiliation. As Arab nationalism lost all credibility in the 1970s and 1980s, the space it left was filled by religion and the emergence of religious-political forces that would gain ground in many Arab countries. </p><p>The utter discredit of modern Arab states, with their brutal regimes, corruption and undemocratic social contracts, only pushed people to abandon all hope in the state and fall back on primary identities such as sect or tribe in times of crisis. From there to a recognition that people of different sectarian or ethnic origins could not live together the distance was not very large. In Iraq  and Syria  this mood has been reinforced in the past three years, while in Lebanon  it has remained latent, though real. </p><p>As the Lebanese look toward the conflicts in  Syria and Iraq, there is no reason to be reassured. Lebanon’s sectarian makeup is similar, while the presence of over 1 million mostly Sunni  Syrian refugees who are not likely to soon return home may emerge as a major source of instability. That is why Hezbollah  and Iran  have an interest in ensuring that President Bashar Assad  allows the refugees to come home, so they do not reverse Sunni-Shiite demographics in  Lebanon to their disadvantage.</p><p>Lost in the sectarian free-for-all are Lebanon’s Christians. Already, they can sense, national dynamics are being largely driven by Sunni-Shiite relations. This has led some Christians to discuss the introduction of alternative political systems for the country, above all federalism. The only problem with federalism is that there are no truly homogenous areas in the country:  Lebanon is not Switzerland, and minorities in federal districts dominated by other sects will never feel secure. </p><p>If, as some are predicting, the states of the region break down into separate entities, the impetus to follow suit will likely reach Lebanon. The country was created in 1920 against the aspirations of many of its Muslims to be part of a larger Arab nation. One of the principal motives of the Maronite supporters of the  Lebanon project was to avoid becoming citizens of a state in which they would be swallowed up by a Muslim majority. </p><p>The fragmentation of  Lebanon would represent a complete reversal of such tendencies. Muslims, who once aspired to an Arab state of which geographical  Lebanon would be only a part, would effectively be abandoning coexistence and a common destiny to embrace the antithesis of the Arab nationalist ideal. </p><p>While this is not comforting, it’s usually the way separation is achieved that makes all the difference. As in Bosnia during the 1990s, divorces can be violent as everyone tries to grab as much land as possible, expelling or killing those from other communities in the areas conquered. We are seeing such impulses in  Iraq and Syria, and they are very worrisome. But against this, as Mazower observed, there is also a pervasive sense that sectarian or ethnic purity ultimately bring stability.</p><p>The Lebanese went through a similar experience between 1975 and 1990, but they never went all the way in formalizing new entities. Perhaps the country is, quite simply, too small. But more effort is required to ensure that  Lebanon can weather the storms gathering on the horizon. Unfortunately, very little in the behavior of Lebanon’s political actors generates optimism.</p><p>That is why the continued bickering over a new president seems so out of place at this time. Hezbollah, clearly, sees things in a different light, viewing the choice of president as vital in its effort to protect its weapons in Lebanon, therefore maintain a role in Iran’s regional strategy. And that is why Michel Aoun  seems so petty in his refusal to accept that he cannot be elected as a consensual candidate. Constitutionally, the president is the symbol of the nation’s unity, yet neither  Hezbollah nor Aoun appears to have given this much thought, while the decision of March 14 to stick to Samir Geagea shows a similar obstinacy.</p><p>But beyond Hezbollah, Aoun and March 14,  Lebanon must better prepare for the riptide that is coming. If the communities opt for coexistence, as they must in so diminutive a country, then there are underlying prerequisites for it to succeed. And if coexistence becomes impossible, then peaceful change of the political system must be discussed. But war must at all costs be averted.  Lebanon has already been there, and  Iraq and  Syria offer models that no one has any desire to follow. </p><p>Michael Young is opinion editor of THE DAILY STAR.

Almost nothing, however, is being said about Syria, and how it fits into any effort to reverse ISIL&#x2019;s gains.</p><p> What most governments appear consciously to be ignoring is that there is an organic link between Iraq and Syria. And that is precisely the message ISIL has sought to confirm in its claims to be erasing the borders between the two countries on the path toward a new caliphate.</p><p>For Iran, any acknowledgement that the situation in Syria is partly responsible for creating ISIL risks turning into an indictment of the Islamic Republic&#x2019;s role in the country. Indeed, Iran&#x2019;s support for Bashar Al Assad&#x2019;s repression of the uprising against his rule has been perceived as an effort by Shia Iran to bolster a minority regime against the Sunnis.</p><p>The American perspective has been somewhat different. By portraying the situation in Iraq as, principally, a terrorism issue, and by failing to mention how the situation in Syria has affected this, Barack Obama has once again sought to avoid a debate over a reorientation of Washington&#x2019;s Syria policy.</p><p> But whatever is done in Iraq can never be complete unless a complementary policy is adopted in Syria. The reasons are fairly obvious. First, eastern Syria has provided ISIL with a vast territory that escapes any government control and that contains oil reserves the group has exploited to finance itself.</p><p>Second, with an open Syrian-Iraqi border, militants facing military attacks in Iraq can always slip back into Syria while waiting for the situation to blow over. And given Sunni discontent in Iraq, undoubtedly there would be many opportunities for ISIL to return there, especially as it is unlikely the Iraqi government can seal the border with Syria. </p><p> The only realistic means to ending the ISIL threat is to alter the environment in which it is operating. That means, above all, putting an end to the vacuum that ISIL has been able to fill in both Syria and Iraq. On the Iraqi side, it doubtless also means persuading prime minister Nouri Al Maliki to open up to the Sunnis, whose discontent ISIL has latched on to.</p><p> Mr Al Maliki was never sympathetic to the Sunni Awakening, the American-led effort to mobilise the Sunni tribes of Anbar against Al Qaeda in Iraq. When the Americans withdrew from Iraq, the prime minister cut funding to the Awakening councils, one of several measures that pushed the Sunnis to turn against the central government in Baghdad.</p><p> Unfortunately, Mr Al Maliki is not a conciliator by nature, and the Shia-centric policies he has pursued have had the backing of Iran, the most influential actor in Iraq. Yet unless the prime minister better integrates Sunnis into the Iraqi state, they will remain hostile to him, and ISIL will take advantage of this.</p><p> Moreover, Mr Al Maliki&#x2019;s policies have alienated the Kurds as well, making them press forward toward de facto independence. Therefore the Iraqi prime minister&#x2019;s approach is only accelerating Iraq&#x2019;s break-up into separate sectarian or ethnic entities, and this will continue unless he changes course. </p><p>In Syria, too, a parallel strategy must be pursued to deny ISIL a separate area over which it has control and in which it can finance its operations. This would involve arming and training Syrian opposition groups opposed to ISIL. Already, ISIL has reportedly sent weaponry and equipment back to Syria in an apparent bid to follow up its successes in Iraq with steps to expand its area of control in Syria. This has to be prevented.</p><p>The Americans do not seem opposed to such action, and indeed in a speech at West Point recently Mr Obama declared he would &#x201c;work with Congress to ramp up support for those in the Syrian opposition who offer the best alternative to terrorists and brutal dictators&#x201d;. But there are many ways to interpret such a mandate, and until now the United States and its partners have not clearly defined what this support might entail.</p><p> The irony is that the American fear that terrorist groups may get a hold of American weapons through the Syrian rebels has already taken place because of the sudden disintegration of the Iraqi army, which Washington had considered reliable.</p><p> For now Mr Obama says he has taken no final decisions on what to do in Iraq. There is even talk of American collaboration with Iran in combating ISIL. All this opens potentially interesting doors. However, given US-Iran differences over Syria, there can be no serious prospect of integrating Syria into a counterterrorism policy embraced by the two countries.</p><p>It would be a mistake for the Obama administration to take action in Iraq that places it on one side or the other in the escalating sectarian conflict in the country. ISIL&#x2019;s success has been to anchor itself into a widespread movement of Sunni dissatisfaction, one that has the backing of many Arab states. By fighting ISIL, the Americans may be seen as bolstering Iraq&#x2019;s Shia community against the marginalised Sunnis.</p><p>One way to avoid this is by giving the mainly Sunni Syrian rebels the means to oppose and defeat ISIL and show that there is no sectarian agenda behind American decisions. Dealing with Iraq while doing nothing in Syria will only allow ISIL to survive. It is time for officials to address this reality head on.</p><p>Michael Young is opinion editor of The Daily Star newspaper in Beirut</p><p>On Twitter: @BeirutCalling</p>";s:17:"post_image_height";i:0;s:16:"post_image_width";i:0;s:11:"post_visits";i:7;s:18:"post_twitterShares";i:24;s:19:"post_facebookShares";i:2;s:16:"post_totalShares";i:26;s:16:"post_socialScore";i:20;s:13:"post_virality";i:26;s:9:"blog_name";N;s:16:"blog_description";N;s:8:"blog_url";N;s:11:"blog_author";N;s:28:"blog_author_twitter_username";N;s:13:"blog_rss_feed";N;s:9:"blog_tags";N;s:2:"id";N;s:11:"blog_active";N;s:24:"blog_last_post_timestamp";N;s:6:"col_id";i:7;s:8:"col_name";s:29:"Michael Young at The National";s:16:"col_media_source";s:12:"The National";s:13:"col_home_page";s:109:"http://www.thenational.ae/apps/pbcs.dll/search?q=*&NavigatorFilter=[Byline:Michael%20Young]&BuildNavigators=1";s:13:"col_shorthand";s:8:"myoungtn";s:26:"col_media_source_shorthand";s:12:"the_national";s:27:"col_author_twitter_username";s:13:"beirutcalling";s:8:"col_tags";s:20:"columnists, politics";s:15:"col_description";s:50:"Michael Young is opinion editor of THE DAILY STAR.";s:23:"col_last_post_timestamp";i:1404314164;}i:17;O:8:"stdClass":36:{s:7:"post_id";i:31471;s:8:"post_url";s:64:"http://www.executive-magazine.com/buzz/photos-beirut-design-week";s:10:"post_title";s:29:"In photos: Beirut Design Week";s:10:"post_image";s:73:"http://www.executive-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/GR4_6952.jpg";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:123:"Last week saw Lebanon’s designers out in force, participating in the annual Beirut Design Week (BDW).

Now in its third year, BDW has made a name for itself in showcasing and engaging the local creative community. The week featured around 87 exhibitions by local designers along with a variety of talks by international and local speakers, as well as workshops on topics ranging from design and business to jewelry and fashion. Networking happy hours, dinners, design-related film screenings and open markets also took place throughout the week.</p>
<p>All these activities provided a platform for both established and emerging Lebanese designers, giving the public the opportunity to learn more about them and appreciate their work as a viable part of the economy — albeit in need of some support. Designers in turn were able to engage with each other, strengthening the network of local artisans.</p>

<p>One of the highlights of BDW was the Newcomers Exhibition — a showcase that exemplifies how BDW has become a springpad for local talent. Last year, Jo Baaklini participated in the Newcomers Exhibition and went on to be part of fashion design incubator Starch’s 2013 lineup of designers. He got then his own catwalk experience during this year’s Fashion Forward event in Dubai. This year, Baaklini returned to BDW with Starch.</p>
<p>Another goal of BDW was the collaboration and sharing of ideas that naturally occur when the design community gets together. “The most beautiful part of Beirut Design Week is the idea of collaboration: meeting new people and knowing more about other designers,” said Emne Mroue, who took part in the Newcomers Exhibition with her Sacoche collection.</p>
<p>Finally, BDW aimed to engage and train designers with talks and workshops throughout the week. This expanded emphasis was a welcome change from 2013’s BDW, which had only one day dedicated to such events.</p>
<p>BDW was organized by the MENA Design and Research Center, a nonprofit organization cofounded by Doreen Toutikian, an interdisciplinary designer and entrepreneur, and Maya Karanouh, CEO of TAGbrands, a branding consultancy.</p>

Similar but less intense tensions define most Arab states. With the exception of Tunisia, the citizens of every Arab country have always been denied any say in defining the structure, values or policies of their state.</p><p>It is no surprise, therefore, that Syria,  Iraq and  Libya should be at once so violent, fractious and brittle. The capture of cities and territory across northern  Iraq by the Islamic State of  Iraq and Greater Syria  (ISIS) symbolizes a common aspect of the fragmented nature of many Arab countries: the ruling party or family that runs the government is at war with well-armed non-state actors that reflect widespread citizen discontent with the power and policies of the central state. The brittle Arab state is not simply melting away, as happened in Somalia over the last two decades; rather, the state in many cases has become just one armed protagonist in a battle against several other armed protagonists among its own citizens. </p><p>The novelty of  Iraq today, as with  Syria to a lesser extent, is the presence of fighters from many other countries who have joined the fray, because the borders of the country have largely been erased by their own lack of legitimacy in the eyes of the citizens. So in this sense ISIS is a greater threat in the short run than other such militant sectarian movements, because it controls territory that provides a base of operations; it enjoys fiscal resources (oil, bank robberies, commercial routes); it attracts fighters from abroad who have no relationship to the local people under their control; it operates as a hybrid between a guerrilla force and a formal army; and, it explicitly challenges the state-based system of countries that we inherited from the spoils of World War I. </p><p>The world has never seen such a phenomenon as this post-state territory of deterritorialized individual fighters whose only principles are anchored in an ancestral vision of religious dictates. Groups such as ISIS have no future in the Middle East. But they will be a major problem for some years to come, until legitimate statehood and efficacious governance take root. This has never really happened in most Arab states because of the ongoing lack of validation of all states by their own people.</p><p>The battle now taking place in Syria,  Libya and  Iraq is very complex and will continue because it combines elements of wars of independence, civil wars, attempts to redefine the borders and values of individual countries, and revenge movements against the mismanagement, sectarianism and harsh rule of the past half-century at least. Drone attacks and troops from the United States or Iran or any other foreign source will not have any significant impact on the multiple forces that drive the fighting and fragmentation in many Arab countries, and would probably only aggravate the violence. </p><p>Egypt, Tunisia, Yemen and  Libya have all shown how hard it is to shape new governance systems in the wake of the ouster of their autocratic leaders, if there is no clear social contract that gives all citizens equal opportunities to reconfigure their state. Syria, Libya, Bahrain and  Iraq have also indicated the willingness of many actors to use military force to maintain their rule or challenge the incumbent rulers. </p><p>The popular uprisings that erupted three-and-a-half years ago have exposed the lack of foundations for coherent statehood in several Arab countries, and in some cases led to a vacuum that has been filled by various fighting forces in Syria,  Iraq and Libya. The groups that will tap the desires of indigenous communities to live in peace with one another will be the ones to emerge victorious. Until then, the region will have to endure many years of violence that will only end when ordinary people feel they have had the opportunity to engage in the two seminal state-building processes that they have always been denied – self-determination and genuine sovereignty. </p><p>ISIS and others like it reflect none of these sentiments, which is why they will not be part of the long-term scene in the region, despite their short-term prominence. Any response to ISIS should not focus on only restraining their advances, but rather on responding to the local citizens’ 100 years of unfulfilled desires for conditions that would promote their self-determination and sovereignty. </p><p>Rami G.
