Wherever they are and whatever they are doing, selfies are being taken to be published on social networks for others to see.</p>
<p>Every woman is trying her best to look sexy in the selfie for others to notice and be curiously interested. As per <a href="http://coed.com/" target="_blank">COED</a> website, “Sideboob” selfies are considered as the most sexual ones.</p>

<p>On the other side, Instagram blocked the account of Heather Bays who took a selfie of her breastfeeding her 20-month old daughter. Heather told <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/" target="_blank">CBC</a> that this discrimination is not only against mothers but also women.</p>
<p><a href="https://lfadi.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/2.jpeg"><img src="http://lfadi.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/2.jpeg?w=300&h=168" alt="2" width="300" height="168"></a></p>
<p><em>Source: http://news.store-1.net/</em></p>
<p>We all understand that pornographic and explicit sexual content is forbidden as per Instagram internal rules but it is totally abnormal to block a photo of a woman breastfeeding her daughter and permit other sexy women’s photos where the face is secondary as people may miss looking at sometimes.</p>
<p>What a disgrace for humanity to proud a woman for being sexy and shame her for being mother.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>P.S.: That’s my own opinion and I may be wrong of course. However, nobody can ignore the fact that the second photo here is more bashful and decent than the first one, mostly that less parts of the body are shown in it.</p>

In fact, some of its words and phrases are so lush with imagery and meaning that they bear no equivalent in any other language. Nuances and undertones inevitably get lost in translation, and rich idiomatic expressions are butchered all together. 
  
  Join me on a linguistic tour of Arabic’s most untranslatable and lyrical words, expressions, and sayings. Don’t tire yourself trying to unravel them to a non-speaker—just have pride in being part of something precious! 
  
  1. Yo2borneh or to2brineh
  
  (Image via Tumblr)
  
  Literally, it means “you bury me,” and the first thought that springs to mind is deeply troubling. But the connotative punch this word packs is absolutely beautiful. You love someone so much that you can’t imagine a life without them, and you’re hoping you pass away first. Chillingly endearing. 
  
  2. Trabi7 jmeeleh
  
  (Image via Tumblr)
  
  This is quite easily the tramp stamp of every true Lebanese. You render a favor unto someone, but rather than doing it out of the goodness of your heart, you remind the recipient of it as soon as you either need a favor in return or, more heinously, to blackmail them. It’s like keeping a tally of your deeds and exploiting them as leverage whenever the occasion lends itself.  
  
  3. Inshallah or Nchalla
  
  (Image via Tumblr)
  
  Many Arabic speakers shy away from the firm “yes” all together and opt for this word, which literally means “God willing.” 
  
  Are you coming tonight? Inshallah.
  Did you pass your exam? Inshallah.
  Will you ever marry me? Inshallah. (If you hear this, drop him/her in and run!)
  
  It’s an effective tool to buy you out of any guarantees and hold you scot-free in case things don’t go as planned. Never strike a bargain with “Inshallah.” 
  
  4. Na3iman
  
  (Image via Tumblr)
  
  In this compact word, Arabic gives new meaning to the English expression, “cleanliness is next to godliness.” Na3iman is the blessing you bestow on someone who’s just showered or had their hair cut and/or styled. What’s even cuter is the requisite response: “Yin3am 3aleik/3aleiki,” which reciprocates the blessing. 
  
  5. 3a2belik or 3a2belak
  
  (Image via Tumblr)
  
  Most young people cringe in contempt when someone wishes them this, a word repeated endlessly at engagements, weddings, christenings and the like. Basically, by incanting this, you are wishing the same blessing upon the target. Who needs a constant reminder of their bachelor status at every marriage ceremony? Loathsome. 
  
  6. T2eel ‘dam
  
  (Image via Tumblr)
  
  Imagine measuring one’s character by the weight or density of their blood. In Arabic, someone who’s described as heavy-blooded is dreadfully annoying, on par with a plague. Often this expression gets truncated to “t2eel” or “t2eeleh” and “ma 2at2alak” or “ma 2at2alik.” You never want to be the object of this phrase. 
  
  7. Wasta
  
  (Image via Tumblr)
  
  Perhaps the quintessence of Lebanese-hood is wasta, a powerful word used to indicate powerful connectedness. If you’re blessed to have a wasta, you have an unfair advantage over others in getting to your object of desire. Wastas are like the Monopoly card that lets you “Pass Go and Collect $200.” Never question it if you’re fortunate enough to have one: simply enjoy!
  
  8. Toz 3aleik or Toz 3aleiki
  
  (Image via Tumblr)
  
  This is a playful expression which in no figurative terms sends a fart in the recipient’s direction. It’s used to denote hot, empty air or even general apathy—“toz” alone can mean “who cares” or “what’s it to me?” Graduating up the filthy totem pole, “khara 3aleik” or “khara 3aleiki” literally means “poo on you,” and, depending on the tone, it can be used humorously, endearingly, or menacingly. 
  
  9. Bayyid wij or Tobyeed wij
  
  (Image via Tumblr)
  
  If this phrase were directly translated to English, it would mean “whitening one’s face.” It sort of resembles “powdering one’s face” but in the figurative sense. If someone asks you to “bayidleh wijjeh,” they’re supplicating you to make them proud and elevate their status. If you’re guilty of “tobjeed wijj,” you’re kissing ass, or brown-nosing. Funny how the colors don’t transfer between Arabic and English! 
  
  10. Bitmoon or bitmooneh
  
  (Image via Tumblr)
  
  You’re in someone’s good graces if they utter this to you. Somehow you’ve earned brownie points with them, and they’re willing to carry you on their shoulders if that’s what it takes to please you. You get to call the shots, but don’t overdo it or risk being labeled “t2eel ‘dam”! </p>";s:17:"post_image_height";i:300;s:16:"post_image_width";i:490;s:11:"post_visits";i:52;s:18:"post_twitterShares";i:0;s:19:"post_facebookShares";i:371;s:16:"post_totalShares";i:371;s:16:"post_socialScore";i:61;s:13:"post_virality";i:47;s:9:"blog_name";N;s:16:"blog_description";N;s:8:"blog_url";N;s:11:"blog_author";N;s:28:"blog_author_twitter_username";N;s:13:"blog_rss_feed";N;s:9:"blog_tags";N;s:2:"id";N;s:11:"blog_active";N;s:24:"blog_last_post_timestamp";N;s:6:"col_id";i:18;s:8:"col_name";s:17:"Beirut City Guide";s:16:"col_media_source";s:10:"Beirut.com";s:13:"col_home_page";s:23:"http://beirut.com/blogs";s:13:"col_shorthand";s:15:"beirutcityguide";s:26:"col_media_source_shorthand";s:15:"beirutcityguide";s:27:"col_author_twitter_username";s:15:"beirutcityguide";s:8:"col_tags";s:7:"society";s:15:"col_description";s:50:"a valuable resource for locals and visitors alike.";s:23:"col_last_post_timestamp";i:1405667941;}i:3;O:8:"stdClass":36:{s:7:"post_id";i:32219;s:8:"post_url";s:73:"http://chitiktikchiti3a.blogspot.com/2014/07/atheism-is-invading-ksa.html";s:10:"post_title";s:24:"Atheism is invading KSA.";s:10:"post_image";s:101:"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-DApJ2ePPWJg/U7OF1nmLnkI/AAAAAAAABQs/UQi99Scc3QA/s1600/atheism-KSA-ISlam.jpg";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:123:"Please subscribe to our blog to get our latest update ------->>>>>This year, KSA publicized the Penal Law for Crimes of ...";s:7:"blog_id";s:16:"chitiktikchiti3a";s:14:"post_timestamp";i:1404298140;s:12:"post_content";s:4237:"<div dir="ltr" trbidi="on"><div align="center"><b><i><span lang="EN-GB">Please subscribe to our blog to get our latest update ------->>>>></span></i></b><br><b><i><span lang="EN-GB"><br></span></i></b></div><div><span>This year, KSA publicized the Penal Law for Crimes of Terrorism.

Probably because the qualification was secured and Didier Deshamps chose to rest some players like Valbuena. </span><br><span>In their game against Nigeria in the second round, they had difficulty in scoring in the first half due to the combination GIROUD, BENZEMA. The coach took a very good decision by replacing Giroud by Griezman and they scored two goals.  Concerning Germans, they performed a beautiful show in their first match against Portuguese beating them 4-0 (not to forget that Portugal played with 10 players), their performance against Ghana and USA was weak; Ghana was pretty close from surprising us.</span><br><div><span><span><br></span></span><div><div><img src="http://www.wallpaperseries.com/files/games/France%20Vs%20Germany%20FIFA%20World%20Cup%202014%20Second%20Stage%20Wallpaper.jpg" height="200" width="320"></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>In the second round, they faced the tough Algerian team and they won 2-1 in the additional time. The Algerians were fighting hard and playing a very good football, the Germans showed good performance in their second half while showing at the same time clear defensive gaps. In my opinion, the game between France and Germany will end in the official time by a draw of 1-1 and I won’t be surprised at all if France won.</span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><h2><span><b>Brazil vs. Colombia</b></span></h2><span>The performance of Brazilian team in this world cup was poor. With the shining star Neymar and some arbitrary errors, the Brazilians had barely pass to the second round. Until now, they did not impress me at all. Their performance against Chili in the second round was also poor; they were a bit lucky in this game, and thanks to the brilliant goal Julio Cesar keeper they were saved in the penalty shots.  The Colombians were impressive, they won easily all their matches even without their greatest player Radamel Falcao. However let us be authentic, they didn’t face any real opponent (Japan, Cote d’Ivoire, Greece and Uruguay without Suarez).  In my opinion, this game will end in the official time by a draw of 1-1.</span></div><div><span>Please don't hesitate to share your opinion with us</span></div></div></div></div>";s:17:"post_image_height";i:1200;s:16:"post_image_width";i:1920;s:11:"post_visits";i:50;s:18:"post_twitterShares";i:1;s:19:"post_facebookShares";i:11;s:16:"post_totalShares";i:12;s:16:"post_socialScore";i:60;s:13:"post_virality";i:20;s:9:"blog_name";s:17:"ChiTikTik ChiTi3a";s:16:"blog_description";s:66:"Chitiktik Chiti3a is a space for every free and intellectual mind.";s:8:"blog_url";s:37:"http://chitiktikchiti3a.blogspot.com/";s:11:"blog_author";s:0:"";s:28:"blog_author_twitter_username";s:9:"ChiTikTik";s:13:"blog_rss_feed";s:64:"http://chitiktikchiti3a.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss";s:9:"blog_tags";s:14:"society, books";s:2:"id";i:278;s:11:"blog_active";i:1;s:24:"blog_last_post_timestamp";i:1405669140;s:6:"col_id";N;s:8:"col_name";N;s:16:"col_media_source";N;s:13:"col_home_page";N;s:13:"col_shorthand";N;s:26:"col_media_source_shorthand";N;s:27:"col_author_twitter_username";N;s:8:"col_tags";N;s:15:"col_description";N;s:23:"col_last_post_timestamp";N;}}
