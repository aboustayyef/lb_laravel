<p>The company unveiled the two-seater prototype during an interview at the Recode Code Conference in California.</p>
<p>Google’s prototype car relies on built-in sensors, a system to safely guide the vehicle without the use of today’s cars standard instruments and operates at speeds of around 25 miles per hour.</p>
<p><span>Google CEO Sergey Brin introduced the car at the conference and said that t</span>he goal of the company’s self-driving cars is to be “significantly” safer than human-driven cars in the next few years. The prototype was made using off-the-shelf car parts, foam and an electric motor.</p>
<blockquote><p>“The reason I’m super excited about these prototypes is the ability to change the world and the community around you,” Brin said.</p></blockquote>

I used to think that marking an email as spam is similar to telling the police about someone who annoys you. It would get that person off your back for good, but it would also mark you as a snitch and someone who harmed someone else because he didn’t want to be annoyed.</p>
<p>But then I found out that marking an email as spam is simply like muting a sender. It will just send the emails to your trash folder instead of your inbox. From that day on, whenever I got an email that I didn’t like, a press release, a penis enlargement ad, a promotion from a company that I otherwise liked, I immediately click on the (!) button (the keyboard shortcut for “Mark As Spam” on Gmail). </p>
<p>The point is that I don’t have to have a guilty conscience. If I marked the (unsolicited) Daily Star’s newsletters as SPAM, that’s not the same as telling google that the Daily Star (a company I like) are spammers, it’s simply saying that I don’t want to receive those emails anymore.</p>
<p>The result ? Peace of mind. <a href="http://www.43folders.com/43-folders-series-inbox-zero">Inbox zero</a>. This is what my inbox looks like right now:</p>

<p>The co-founders revealed the plans at a conference held in California(as per the BBC News):</p>
<p>“<em>We’re really excited about this vehicle – it’s something that will allow us to really push the capabilities of self driving technology, and understand the limitations. In addition, t</em><em>here’s a safety benefit in a custom-built self driving car because the non existence of a steering wheel, accelerator or brakes. It also has more sensors in strategic spots than is possible in a regular vehicle.</em>“</p>
<p> </p>
<p>However, before thinking about whether this technology will reduce the traffic or improve people’s lives, I hope it will be usable in Lebanon with the roads and traffic signs we have.</p>

Despite its shortcomings, however, the 610 manages to give it an edge over other midrange phones.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.absolutegeeks.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/HTC-DESIRE-610-REVIEW-03.jpg" rel="lightbox-0"><img src="http://www.absolutegeeks.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/HTC-DESIRE-610-REVIEW-03-1024x576.jpg" alt="HTC-DESIRE-610-REVIEW-03" width="838" height="471"></a></p>
<h2>Design & Screen</h2>
<p>The 610 is quite large for a 4.7″ screen – with the thick bezel and dual front speakers, it stands quite tall at 5.63″; however, it does not feel uncomfortable in the hand. The rounded sides makes it comfortable to hold and the rubbery rim gives it a firm grip. The back is glossy and contrasts with the matte front and rubbery side; it is a design quirk that works, but some people may have reservations. At 143g it isn’t that heavy for its size, either.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.absolutegeeks.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/HTC-DESIRE-610-REVIEW-04.jpg" rel="lightbox-1"><img src="http://www.absolutegeeks.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/HTC-DESIRE-610-REVIEW-04-1024x576.jpg" alt="HTC-DESIRE-610-REVIEW-04" width="838" height="471"></a></p>
<p>The screen itself has a midrange resolution  of 540×960 pixels, setting it at roughly 230ppi. Up close it is a bit fuzzy and the colours are slightly on the cool side, but held at normal distance this is hardly an issue. As mentioned, the colours are slightly on the cool side (compared to the Nexus 5) but the Nexus 5′s white balance is also on the warmer side. Ultimately this becomes a non-issue as the eye will adapt quickly to not notice, unlike the issue I faced with the <a title="HTC Desire 310 Review" href="http://www.absolutegeeks.com/2014/05/htc-desire-310-review/" target="_blank">Desire 310</a>.</p>
<h2>Software & Performance</h2>
<p>Sporting the latest Sense UI 5.5, the Desire 610 is elegant and fast. The Snapdragon 400 is surprisingly snappy and working with the phone is a non-issue. The processor performance does matter in actual <em>processing</em> of course, but for browsing, social media, and regular use, there are no hiccups.</p>

<h2>Camera</h2>
<p>The 8MP camera is quite decent, and the HDR mode does come in handy. Photos in general of good quality but typically fuzzy up close as with midrange phones. It does a very good job however, and the front camera does an OK job as well.</p>

<p>Problems can arise though when taking some macro shots of multi-coloured object as this will throw the sensor into an over-saturation frenzy. With some finicking and fine-tuning and patience you can still take the shot but requires effort on your part.</p>
<h2>Overall</h2>
<p>The Desire 610 is a very good mid-range phone that does not feel midrange had it not been for the low resolution screen. It works very well and the Sense UI 5.5 does make it stand out from the rest of the midrange phones by giving you quality software. In the UAE it is priced at AED 1199.</p>";s:17:"post_image_height";i:576;s:16:"post_image_width";i:1024;s:11:"post_visits";i:2;s:18:"post_twitterShares";i:3;s:19:"post_facebookShares";i:1;s:16:"post_totalShares";i:4;s:16:"post_socialScore";i:8;s:13:"post_virality";i:11;s:9:"blog_name";s:14:"Absolute Geeks";s:16:"blog_description";s:28:"Unleash The Tech Geek In You";s:8:"blog_url";s:24:"http://absolutegeeks.com";s:11:"blog_author";s:0:"";s:28:"blog_author_twitter_username";s:13:"absolutegeeks";s:13:"blog_rss_feed";s:34:"http://www.absolutegeeks.com/feed/";s:9:"blog_tags";s:4:"tech";s:2:"id";i:268;s:11:"blog_active";i:1;s:24:"blog_last_post_timestamp";i:1401602040;}i:7;O:8:"stdClass":26:{s:7:"post_id";i:30211;s:8:"post_url";s:92:"http://lfadi.wordpress.com/2014/05/26/the-poker-movies-in-the-last-20-years-by-abeer-mourad/";s:10:"post_title";s:60:"The poker movies in the last 20 years! “by Abeer Mourad”";s:10:"post_image";s:52:"http://lfadi.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/movie12.jpg";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:123:"While some of us enjoy the thrills of playing poker and risking our own money, the game can be a welcome distraction on ...";s:7:"blog_id";s:5:"lfadi";s:14:"post_timestamp";i:1401109980;s:12:"post_content";s:5602:"<p>While some of us enjoy the thrills of playing poker and risking our own money, the game can be a welcome distraction on the big screen for others. Over the years poker games have been the main focal points and scenes of some films, but some of the movies really stand out. In the last twenty or so years we can pick out five of the best poker and gambling films that have truly drawn us in, making us feel as if we are risking everything in this magnificent card game. Whether you play on a casino online or just at home with friends, these films are a must see for any poker or gambling lover.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It is interesting also to see how the game has changed in films over the years and how they have drawn more people to the game. First there is the film <strong><em>Rounders</em></strong> starring <strong>Matt Damon</strong> and <strong>Edward Norton</strong>. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rounders_(film)">The movie is about a student</a> who plays to pay his way through school, until he loses a large sum in one game when he risks too much on one hand. But, he is drawn back into the dangerous world of underground poker when his friend and old partner is released from prison. The film culminates with a showdown against a very dangerous character played by John Malkovich, leaving you on the edge of your seat guessing until the end. The message is that we should enjoy playing the game of poker without risking our livelihoods and safety.</p>
<p><a href="http://lfadi.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/movie12.jpg"><img src="http://lfadi.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/movie12.jpg?w=522" alt="Image"></a></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Next, easily one of the best gambling films is <strong><em>Casino</em></strong><em>.</em> It stars the great <strong>Robert De Niro</strong> and tells the story of the mafia run casinos in Las Vegas during the notorious era of the 1970’s in sin city. It is most definitely not a film to watch with the kids, but provides us with some amazing acting and thrills. Also, the film <strong><em>In Time</em></strong> with <strong>Justin Timberlake</strong> teaches us about the dangers of betting. It is set in the future when everyone has a finite amount of time left to live and is calculated by a clock on our arms. The rich obviously have infinite time but the poor are forced to bet against each other with arm wrestling to win more time to live. It is a great social commentary on what betting and gambling can lead to; risking your livelihood to achieve wealth and immortality.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong><em>Casino Royale</em></strong>, one of the latest Bond movies, is an amazing film for poker lovers. <strong>Daniel Craig</strong> keeps us tensed up during the whole film, which revolves around one poker game that he must win to save countless lives. The new movie <strong><em>Runner Runner</em></strong> with Ben Affleck shows how poker movies and <a href="http://www.casino-oasis.com/?C=TRACKING_ID@-74856954000!SYSTEM_ID@INTERNAL">the game it self is changing because it is about online casino</a> and gambling. It has a similar premise to the aforementioned film <em>Rounders</em>, but with a contemporary online twist. Any of these movies are perfect for poker and gambling lovers everywhere.</p>

<p>This year the first world cup ball will be kicked by a paralyzed teen using a mind controlled exoskeleton! Thanks to a joint effort from universities such as Colorado State University, The Technical University of Munich and Duke University, a paralyzed teen will start the ceremony by kicking a ball using only a mind controlled motorized exoskeleton. Pretty impressive i might add!  Just imagine if this could be done today, then in the near future paralyzed individuals will have the chance to walk again! Check out this video from the Colorado state university explaining everything:</p>

Back then, I had no time to even think about anything outside of the realm of the first <a href="http://www.twitter.com/smamena" target="_blank">Social Media Awards</a> (SMAs) in Beirut, which were coming up. There was just so much to do. I must say I was skeptical about how the concept of the magazine would be received by the online community and digital agencies in Lebanon, knowing how the local vibe is generally tainted with competition and jealousy.</strong></div><div>At that point, Cornerstone PR, the publisher of the magazine, wanted to sponsor the SMAs, but did not want to be a traditional sponsor with brochures and roll-up banners related to their work. They wanted to give back to the online community and put their voice through a louder speaker, and attract a relatively traditional audience who still believes in print media. Cloud961 was born on April 30, on the night of the SMAs, as a gift to the online community in Lebanon.</div><div>We started with two staff writers, few contributors, and 24 pages. In one year, our team has grown to encompass more than 30 writers and contributors, in addition to a full-fledged marketing and management team, constituting one of the biggest magazine teams in the country. Our second year will witness even more expansion, for we will hopefully launch two independent monthly issues in UAE and KSA.</div><div>Despite that some of the agencies insist the purpose of the magazine is to steal their clients (mostly because they are insecure about their capabilities), Cloud961 has been well received throughout the online community in Lebanon, and it has turned out to be worth the while. In one year, We have distributed over 20,000 print issues and received a whopping 280,000 online downloads.</div><div>Over the past year, we have learned a lot from the community’s feedback. The quality of our articles has improved substantially and our design has become more appealing. It is thanks to your feedback that we are introducing with this issue a new layout, with a smaller page size and an improved magazine feel, for a more practical reading experience.</div><div>Cloud961 will always be the online community’s magazine. Raising its issues, defending its rights, and promoting its people are our priorities. Due to the generous investment of our publisher and the trust of our advertisers, we are entering our second year while remaining free of charge for both print and online versions because we believe that access to information and knowledge should be available to all.</div><div>On behalf of the whole team, I would like to thank our readers for their tremendous support, and our team for the great work that they have been doing.</div><div>Cheers to Cloud, a second year full of success, and to the online community!</div><div><a href="http://www.twitter.com/mhijazi" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-3myUNIsrRRA/U4MmCUPH0JI/AAAAAAAAD5E/5AMULqPLjIg/s1600/mohamad_hijazi_may_2014-620x264.jpg"></a></div><div></div><div><i>A version of this article appeared as my editorial in the 10th issue of <a href="http://www.cloud961.com/" target="_blank">Cloud961</a>.

Unfortunately, we live in an era of recession and one cannot always justify the overhead that comes along with acquiring good talent, let alone training them and retaining them as part of the business.<br><br>While common sense and ancient wisdom might teach us that true champions appear when things are most difficult, this blog is not about an inspirational story of hope and victory of hardship. This post is about those freelancers that we hire to come to our rescue, only to wish later we had succumbed to our misery.<br>There is a certain consolation in failure when the alternative involves another flavor of failure garnished with a side dish of having one's intelligence insulted.<br><br>Here are my top 5 nominees for freelancers archetypes to avoid:<br><ol><li><b>The Time Traveler:</b><br>The time traveler freelancer possesses great powers that allow them to take on a huge number of projects at once. Like the iconic Terminator sentence: "I'll be Back" they are often heard uttering the sentence: "You'll have it on time". By warping the time-space continuum, they can deliver flawless work on short deadlines, while juggling their personal and professional life at once. Of course all of this happens in their own mind and in reality you the business owner are left 2 heartbeats away from a stroke.<br> </li><li><b>The Bipolar</b><br>In psychology the bipolar is often illustrated as someone that can go from being very happy to very depressed very fast. Like in psychology, in freelancing The Bipolar is a very delicate type to handle.They can go very quickly from calling you and begging for work "because I really have a lot to pay this month" to walking out on a project after having started it <i>"I really should stop taking such projects".</i> Scientists are still baffled by this but my building janitor explained it in a few words: "maybe he doesn't have a lot to pay anymore"<br>  </li><li><b>The Lazy Daisy</b><br>Like the cake with the same name this freelancer is usually rather sweet and like the flower, very delicate, but also like any other lazy person out there, utterly useless. You criticize their work and they will not object, you email them your grievances and they reply back acknowledging that, and always gently and nicely without breaking a sweat or in Layman's terms without giving a damn. Nothing can come out of collaborating with such a person who is surely as useful as an ashtray on a motorcycle.<br>  </li><li><b>The Crystal Swan</b><br>This freelancer always needs to be in the spotlight to look their best. They excel at first impressions by highlighting every possible angle to their advantage so they can blind you with the reflection of their awesomeness. Take them away from the pedestal they set themselves on and all they are is fragile pieces of glass that cannot handle pressure and have little value beyond being ornamental. That bird won't fly in the business world and just costs too much to do nothing.<br><br></li><li><b>The Handyman</b><br>The handyman freelancer can help you with just about anything. They can develop websites and app, do your accounting, bring you sales leads, advise on what type of surveillance cameras to install, throw some stock exchange tips your way, do a 5 years product roll-out strategy and even fix your Nespresso machine*.

Or more importantly, didn’t have the resources to let a large number of people know? Yes, you can drop flyers in your building, but why be a litterbug?</p>
<p>Enter Melltoo – an app that runs right off of your smartphone (Android or iOS) and allows you to display your ‘for sale’ items to other users, as well as giving them a chance to IM you right from the app, and rate your items.</p>
<p>Do you really need another selling platform, you might think? And what’s this platform got that others don’t?</p>
<p>Well, to begin with, this is a smartphone app, as opposed to a website – snap a picture of what you’re selling, name it’s price, create your own market and wait for users to connect with you. Beats having to leave your phone number and email address on a public site, for sure.</p>
<p>Launched in Dubai in March 2014 by husband and wife entrepreneurs Morrad Irsane and Sharene Lee, the idea was one borne out of the sheer frustration of trying to buy a used car in the UAE, as explained in this video: <a href="http://youtu.be/0HL-LDK6Vjs">http://youtu.be/0HL-LDK6Vjs</a></p>
<p>Where most people would vent their frustrations out to friends and on Facebook, Morrad decided that he wanted to build a grass roots social network that features user-generated listings and provides a buying and selling peer-to-peer platform with a “user-first” approach.</p>
<p>We downloaded the app on both Android and iOS, to try out the features, and really see what Melltoo is all about and how well it works. Some of the things we liked were:</p>
<h3>Location based tracking</h3>
<p>Melltoo checks your location and then finds you deals closest to you – and it’s pretty accurate.</p>

<p> </p>
<h3>Variety of categories</h3>
<p>It doesn’t really matter what you want to buy or sell – you’ll find a category to list it under in Melltoo, plus they’re developing this segment even further as time goes by</p>

<p> </p>
<h3> Hashtag marketplaces</h3>
<p>If you’re a seller, you can create your own marketplace in Meltoo, give it a name and a hashtag and users can find everything you’re selling right under that hashtag. This allows for seller ratings, as well as being able to find similar items listed together.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>With over 20K+ downloads in just 7 weeks, Melltoo is already in the hands of plenty of people in the region. We asked Morrad how he’s marketing it and getting it across to people, and he informed us that much like the social network itself, even their marketing approach is fairly grass roots at the moment. The Melltoo team has been attending various start-ups conferences in the region, getting their app in the hands of influencers and talking to airline crew, who spend a lot of time abroad buying things and come back to Dubai to sell them – turns out, these people are some of the early adopters of the app.</p>
<p>It’s still fairly new, and although the app’s functionality is pretty good, we feel the iOS version in particular looks a bit heavy on the small real estate of even the iPhone 5S screen, but with the right marketing push, and enough downloads, it’s something that could pick up in the region and give used-items selling websites, Facebook shops and Insta-shops a run for their money.</p>";s:17:"post_image_height";i:360;s:16:"post_image_width";i:480;s:11:"post_visits";i:1;s:18:"post_twitterShares";i:17;s:19:"post_facebookShares";i:8;s:16:"post_totalShares";i:25;s:16:"post_socialScore";i:14;s:13:"post_virality";i:26;s:9:"blog_name";s:14:"Absolute Geeks";s:16:"blog_description";s:28:"Unleash The Tech Geek In You";s:8:"blog_url";s:24:"http://absolutegeeks.com";s:11:"blog_author";s:0:"";s:28:"blog_author_twitter_username";s:13:"absolutegeeks";s:13:"blog_rss_feed";s:34:"http://www.absolutegeeks.com/feed/";s:9:"blog_tags";s:4:"tech";s:2:"id";i:268;s:11:"blog_active";i:1;s:24:"blog_last_post_timestamp";i:1401602040;}i:12;O:8:"stdClass":26:{s:7:"post_id";i:30186;s:8:"post_url";s:36:"http://lebaneseblogs.com/blog/?p=239";s:10:"post_title";s:54:"What Virality Is and Why It’s Useful Against Boobies";s:10:"post_image";s:80:"http://lebaneseblogs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/virality-vs-boobies.jpg";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:123:"Many of you have noticed the post virality indicator that was recently introduced to Lebanese Blogs.

The more attentive of you may have also noticed that the “Top 5 posts” section is now showing better results (more about that later). So what is virality and why is it so important for the quality of rankings?</p>
<p>In a nutshell, <strong>virality is the amount of times a post is shared on facebook and on twitter, expressed as a score over 50. </strong> (If you’re interested in the technical details of how it’s calculated, check out <a href="http://mustapha.me/2014/05/virality-scoring-applied-maths-heuristics/">my post about it</a> in the Geek Blog) </p>
<p>Virality is a great indicator not only because it tells us about how well the posts are being shared on social media, but because it sends a good signal about the quality of a post. </p>
<h3>Boobie Posts Demoted</h3>
<p><img src="http://lebaneseblogs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/virality-vs-boobies.jpg" alt="Virality vs boobies" title="virality-vs-boobies.jpg" border="0" width="600" height="340"></p>
<p>You have all seen them, blog posts that have photos of busty women and catchy titles. Actually most of us have clicked on them, and then regretted it. I will call these and all other click-bait posts “boobie posts”. These are posts that invite the readers with tantalizing headlines and photos but don’t offer any substantial content.</p>
<p>Previously, our top 5 rankings were exclusively based on how much a post is clicked in <em>Lebanese Blogs</em>. This gave un advantage to boobie posts and created an incentive for bloggers to sensationalize their headlines. Where boobie posts come short however is with sharing. People click on boobie posts because they’re curious, but they don’t share them on their social networks because often they’re embarrassed that they read them in the first place. This is why virality is now factored in the calculation to get the top 5 posts, and why you’ll notice more substance in the countdown.</p>
<h3>How do you increase your post’s virality?</h3>
<p>Simple really, virality is a measure of how much people (including you) share your post on facebook and twitter. So the more your posts are shared, the more their virality is increased: Be mindful however that the more shares you get, the more difficult it is to increase the virality score, and that at the top it gets really tough: It is way more difficult for example to go from 45 to 46 than it is to go from 20 to 30 on the virality score.</p>";s:17:"post_image_height";i:340;s:16:"post_image_width";i:600;s:11:"post_visits";i:37;s:18:"post_twitterShares";i:12;s:19:"post_facebookShares";i:12;s:16:"post_totalShares";i:24;s:16:"post_socialScore";i:50;s:13:"post_virality";i:25;s:9:"blog_name";s:26:"The Blog of Lebanese Blogs";s:16:"blog_description";s:62:"Lebanese Blogs' own blog about the development of the platform";s:8:"blog_url";s:30:"http://lebaneseblogs.com/blog/";s:11:"blog_author";s:15:"Mustapha Hamoui";s:28:"blog_author_twitter_username";s:13:"lebaneseblogs";s:13:"blog_rss_feed";s:40:"http://lebaneseblogs.com/blog/?feed=rss2";s:9:"blog_tags";s:4:"tech";s:2:"id";i:70;s:11:"blog_active";i:1;s:24:"blog_last_post_timestamp";i:1401693420;}i:13;O:8:"stdClass":26:{s:7:"post_id";i:30182;s:8:"post_url";s:69:"http://mustapha.me/2014/05/virality-scoring-applied-maths-heuristics/";s:10:"post_title";s:46:"Virality Scoring, Applied Maths and Heuristics";s:10:"post_image";s:64:"http://mustapha.me/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/virality-score.png";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:123:"It rarely happens in everyday life, but last week I found myself thinking of asymptotes, maths and algebra.

<p>It rarely happens in everyday life, but last week I found myself thinking of asymptotes, maths and algebra. The trigger for those unlikely thoughts was the need to solve a little algorithm puzzle at <a href="http://lebaneseblogs.com/"><em>Lebanese blogs</em></a>, a problem that sent me over to <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra2/logarithms-tutorial">Khan academy</a> for a couple of hours of refreshing the algebra I hadn’t touched since I was in high school (namely logarithms and exponents).</p>
<h3>The Problem</h3>
<p>What I was trying to solve is this: Each post in <em>Lebanese Blogs</em> is to get a “virality score” over 50 for how much the post is shared, given that:</p>
<ul><li>Posts can have anywhere between 0 share and 40,000 shares (<a href="http://monkyseemonkydo.com/2014/04/01/%E2%80%A210-shoes-every-guy-should-own%E2%80%A2/">one post</a> actually got that!), but I decided that 500 shares or above will get you a perfect score, even if that undervalues <a href="http://karlremarks.com/">those</a> who regularly get more than 2000 shares per post</li>
<li>The minimum score should be 2 (I don’t want to offend bloggers who don’t use social media sharing <img src="http://mustapha.me/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)">  ).</li>
<li>It should be relatively easy to get average scores, but very hard to get top scores</li>
</ul><p>I knew how I wanted my graph (of score to shares) to look like, the problem was just trying to find the formula to fit this graph. I was really good at algebra in school, but that was many years ago. I looked up deceleration algorithms, I dabbled with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_decay">“exponential decay”</a> (which took me to Khan’s for a refresh in the algebra), I checked <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grading_on_a_curve">grading on a curve</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diminishing_returns">diminishing returns</a>. I got things similar to what I wanted, but never exactly. So the practical man in me realized that I’m sinking way too much time in this and that I needed to go with heuristics (a fancy word for trial and error)</p>
<p>So I headed over to <a href="https://www.desmos.com/">Desmos</a> and kept playing around with my function until I think I finally got the graph I wanted. So, to the curious and to those who want to know exactly how to calculate their score, here’s what I finally settled on: <code>Y = 2 + (6 * x^(1/3))</code>, which verbally translates to: A posts’s virality score is equal to 2 plus 6 multiplied by the cubic root of the amount of shares a post get.</p>
<p>If any of you maths wizards have any idea on how I can <em>slightly</em> shift the bulge to the left and make it almost asymptotic to 50 I would be grateful if you share..</p>

In any case, a compromise must be done in order to fit everything in.</p>
<p>But it does look like Sony has made it. No compromises. The Xperia Z2 makes almost none. It is in fact the closest thing to perfect we’ve ever witnessed when it comes to testing smartphones. The only tiny remark we might formulate is the fact that a 5.2in slab is not the friendliest when it comes to the size and shape of human hands. But that would really be searching for the devil in the details.</p>
<p>With the <a title="Xperia Z1 Flash Review: Adding “1″ to the Z" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/~tech-ticker.com/xperia-z1-flash-review/" target="_blank">Xperia Z1</a> announced and launched six months ago, this new Sony flagship is more than just a made-over Z1. How is that? Sony introduced with the Z2 a new 5.2in IPS screen which was engineered into a thinner and lighter body. The 20.7MP sensor in the camera is also slightly bigger, capable of shooting 4K video and bristling with new features. The Z2 also arrives with the latest version of Android, KitKat, out of the box too.</p>
<h3>The Display</h3>
<p>When it comes to the screen, the new IPS panel on the Z2 simply has much improved viewing angles. Colours are now even more vivid thanks to Sony’s Live Colour LED technology. The display becomes even more enjoyable when you crank up the volume and notice that the Z2 comes with stereo front speakers. Simply awesome.</p>
<p>The only drawbacks we could note regarding the screen are:</p>
<ul><li>The black bland front of the Z2 is a fiend for reflecting light and a fingerprint and dust/pocket lint magnet.</li>
<li>It’s not quite as bright as the screen of the majority of competitors.</li>
<li>Sony’s X-Reality engine seemed to overdo things. Luckily, you can turn it off in the settings menu.</li>
</ul><h3>The Camera</h3>
<p>The Z2 packs a 1/2.5in, 20.7MP Exmor RS sensor with an f/2.0 lens. And this camera is capable of taking downright incredible photos.</p>
<p>Stills are punchy, well exposed and have tons of detail to crop into across all the resolution options – 8MP, 15.5MP, 20.7MP. Framing and autofocus are seriously speedy, too. Sony has also kept its excellent manual controls. EV, ISO, white balance, focus modes and more are on hand for the times when you want to tinker with your shots. Without forgetting the awesome effect/lenses, like the background defocus mode (similar to the one provided by Nokia on the 1020). The auto mode did a pretty good job, but did prove to be weak by times, especially in direct sunlight and low-light environments.</p>

<p>There’s no question the Z2 is one of the best smartphone cameras we’ve come across, if you can use it to its full potential.</p>
<h3>Design and Looks</h3>
<p>The Z2 is comfortably one of the classiest Android phone on the market. It’s extremely well finished, with smoothly rounded corners (breaking a bit with the Z and Z1 designs), an all-glass back and machined aluminium edges. Notwithstanding the fact that the Z2 has the same water-resistance features of its predecessor.</p>
<p>If we were to exclude HTC’s M8, the Z2 would definitely be the most elegant Android handset out there.</p>
<p>The Z2 is definitely beautiful. But it also can be unpractical most of the time. It simply feels big in hand, and its ergonomics make it even more unpractical because of the flat glass panel front and back. So unpractical, that picking it up on a flat desk can be somewhat awkward.</p>
<p>To cut a long story short, you’ll need to handle the device before you buy it. If you don’t find anything awkward about its size and ergonomics, then you can definitely appreciate everything it does brilliantly.</p>
<p><img src="http://i0.wp.com/tech-ticker.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/xperia-z2-gallery-03-stunning-colours-1240x840-df886eea9fecc65a448787e018e7ce5e.jpg?resize=975%2C661" alt="Xperia Z2" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<h3>Software</h3>
<p>Sony’s customised Android KitKat skin is definitely one of the smartest and cleanest you can get, up there alongside HTC’s Sense 6. Android menus, contacts, email or messages UI is pretty standard. And Sony’s own homegrown apps like Walkman, Movies and Music Unlimited are as user-friendly as can be.</p>
<p>The Z2 also has smart gestures: raising the phone to your ear answers a call, tapping the screen twice wakes the device up. Fortunately, the list ends here, since those are pretty much the only gestures we do find useful.</p>
<h3>Performance and Battery Life</h3>
<p>The Z2 is a total powerhouse, with its 2.3GHz Snapdragon 801 processor and rival-besting 3GB of RAM. No lags. Nothing. We do think this smoothness has also lots to do with the clean Android interface Sony has chosen to adopt on all its smartphone line.</p>
<p>Now, whenever the Z2’s Snapdragon is overworked – shooting 4K video or heavy gaming – the handset heats up. But this did happen after a rather prolonged time.</p>
<p>As far as battery life is concerned, The Z2 is reliably excellent and will always last the day. Not more though. The bigger battery pack (3200mAh) compared to that of the Z1 (3000mAh) is a most welcome upgrade. Stamina mode is also present here, and can do wonders when used judiciously. Our only recommendation would be to keep your Z2′s display brightness set on automatic, if you want to make the most out of the device. Full brightness would simply kill it in no time.</p>
<h3>Verdict</h3>
<p>We’ve seen a brand new lineup of Android premium devices this year, with HTC’s M8 or Samsung’s S5. Both devices are pretty awesome on paper, and did perform extremely well in hand too.</p>
<p>But the Xperia Z2 would be for us “the picky geek’s choice”. This is a condensed gadget that’s capable of taking brilliant photos and playing audio and video at top-notch quality, in an extremely beautiful and well crafted package. This phone is ideal for the person for whom quality is the main measure that counts.</p>
<p>The only thing we did not enjoy that much is the device’s size, given its flat design and ergonomics. This is why we can’t wait for the rumoured Sony Z2 Compact to pop-up. This would definitely be the ultimate smartphone for us, no doubt about it.</p>

Once called Presidio Media, Pincus changed the name of its new startup after his beloved dog, <b>Zinga</b>, an American bulldog which has been since the symbol and “face” of the company.</p>
<p>Zynga is a provider and developer of social games that today are played by millions of people all around the world, but that is now menaced by <a href="http://www.casino-oasis.com/free-casino-games/?c=tracking_id@-74860985!system_id@internal"><span>the success of free casino games online</span></a> which last year caused them to lose 25% of daily active users in one quarter. Will Zynga transform itself in a gambling platform like other companies have done in the past or will it remain faithful to its origins?</p>
<p>This is yet to be known. Zynga literally changed the way people play games developing social games that work stand-alone on mobile phone platforms like iOS or Android, taking advantage of the increasing number of people who started using smartphones. Its success grew even bigger when they launched their most famous games on Facebook. Who hasn’t ever played <b>Farmville</b>, <b>Chefville</b>, <b>Words with Friends</b> or Zynga Poker once in their life? Their games are really addictive and keep people entertained for hours. That is why Pincus and his team decided in 2012 to launch their own platform for social gaming and created zynga.com, a website where people could get the chance to play their favourite games off of the Facebook environment, offering new and improved services to their customers.</p>
<p><img src="webkit-fake-url://1c20ff1a-109a-4540-8fc8-17207e957f98/image.tiff" alt=""></p>
<p>In fact, the Zynga.com platform seems to be made just for them. Gamers can play with their friends, but also with other people from all around the world who share their same interests. They can create profiles, recommend others their favourite games, help them through the game and chat, just like a real social network.</p>
<p>Zynga had what it takes to win and wallop its partner Facebook in the war of social games, but then something happened. In 2012, the company had fallen from a pre-money evaluation of about 14$ billion to 2$ billion, but also didn’t manage to maintain its success on <b>Facebook</b> and other mobile platforms like <b>iOS</b> and <b>Android</b>, leading to the loss of millions of users every day. This is when the company started considering bringing its own identity into question and taking a step towards real-money gaming, that is gambling.</p>
<p>Can this new vision really be the key of success of Zynga? It appears so, as the shares have been particularly sensitive to the change. When the company claimed to be considering real-money gaming, their shares got up 10% and fell back by 5% when it was clear they didn’t have any tangible projects towards it.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.trefis.com/stock/znga/articles/225555/why-did-zyngas-stock-jump-after-earnings/2014-02-03"><span>company has already something in common with gambling</span></a> companies: their games are tailored towards monetization, making players want to play more and pay for it. The transition would probably be very easy and painless, but it seems the company still believes in its values and wants to focus on free to play social games. The experts think that if they refocus on their core capabilities and play their cards right – i.e. concluding the acquisition of NaturalMotion – Zynga can gain back its customers and be even more successful than before. The game is not over yet!</p>
